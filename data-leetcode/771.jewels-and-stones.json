                "content": "# Intuition:\\nTo calculate the number of ways to climb the stairs, we can observe that when we are on the nth stair, \\nwe have two options: \\n1. either we climbed one stair from the (n-1)th stair or \\n2. we climbed two stairs from the (n-2)th stair. \\n\\nBy leveraging this observation, we can break down the problem into smaller subproblems and apply the concept of the Fibonacci series. \\nThe base cases are when we are on the 1st stair (only one way to reach it) and the 2nd stair (two ways to reach it). \\nBy summing up the number of ways to reach the (n-1)th and (n-2)th stairs, we can compute the total number of ways to climb the stairs. This allows us to solve the problem efficiently using various dynamic programming techniques such as recursion, memoization, tabulation, or space optimization.\\n\\n# Approach 1: Recursion ```\\u274C TLE \\u274C```\\n**Explanation**: The recursive solution uses the concept of Fibonacci numbers to solve the problem. It calculates the number of ways to climb the stairs by recursively calling the `climbStairs` function for (n-1) and (n-2) steps. However, this solution has exponential time complexity (O(2^n)) due to redundant calculations.\\n\\n# Code\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```Python3 []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n == 0 or n == 1:\\n            return 1\\n        return self.climbStairs(n-1) + self.climbStairs(n-2)\\n```\\n\\n# Approach 2: Memoization\\n**Explanation**: The memoization solution improves the recursive solution by introducing memoization, which avoids redundant calculations. We use an unordered map (`memo`) to store the already computed results for each step `n`. Before making a recursive call, we check if the result for the given `n` exists in the memo. If it does, we return the stored value; otherwise, we compute the result recursively and store it in the memo for future reference.\\n\\n# Code\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int climbStairs(int n, unordered_map<int, int>& memo) {\\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        if (memo.find(n) == memo.end()) {\\n            memo[n] = climbStairs(n-1, memo) + climbStairs(n-2, memo);\\n        }\\n        return memo[n];\\n    }\\n\\n    int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        unordered_map<int, int> memo;\\n        return climbStairs(n, memo);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();\\n        return climbStairs(n, memo);\\n    }\\n    \\n    private int climbStairs(int n, Map<Integer, Integer> memo) {\\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        if (!memo.containsKey(n)) {\\n            memo.put(n, climbStairs(n-1, memo) + climbStairs(n-2, memo));\\n        }\\n        return memo.get(n);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```Python3 []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        memo = {}\\n        return self.helper(n, memo)\\n    \\n    def helper(self, n: int, memo: dict[int, int]) -> int:\\n        if n == 0 or n == 1:\\n            return 1\\n        if n not in memo:\\n            memo[n] = self.helper(n-1, memo) + self.helper(n-2, memo)\\n        return memo[n]\\n```\\n\\n# Approach 3: Tabulation\\n**Explanation**: The tabulation solution eliminates recursion and uses a bottom-up approach to solve the problem iteratively. It creates a DP table (`dp`) of size n+1 to store the number of ways to reach each step. The base cases (0 and 1 steps) are initialized to 1 since there is only one way to reach them. Then, it iterates from 2 to n, filling in the DP table by summing up the values for the previous two steps. Finally, it returns the value in the last cell of the DP table, which represents the total number of ways to reach the top.\\n\\n# Code\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n\\n        vector<int> dp(n+1);\\n        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;\\n        \\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\\n            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];\\n        }\\n        return dp[n];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n\\n        int[] dp = new int[n+1];\\n        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;\\n        \\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\\n            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];\\n        }\\n        return dp[n];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```Python3 []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n == 0 or n == 1:\\n            return 1\\n\\n        dp = [0] * (n+1)\\n        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1\\n        \\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\\n            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\\n        return dp[n]\\n```\\n\\n# Approach 4: Space Optimization\\n**Explanation**: The space-optimized solution further reduces the space complexity by using only two variables (`prev` and `curr`) instead of an entire DP table. It initializes `prev` and `curr` to 1 since there is only one way to reach the base cases (0 and 1 steps). Then, in each iteration, it updates `prev` and `curr` by shifting their values. `curr` becomes the sum of the previous two values, and `prev` stores the previous value of `curr`.\\n\\n# Code\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        int prev = 1, curr = 1;\\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\\n            int temp = curr;\\n            curr = prev + curr;\\n            prev = temp;\\n        }\\n        return curr;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        int prev = 1, curr = 1;\\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\\n            int temp = curr;\\n            curr = prev + curr;\\n            prev = temp;\\n        }\\n        return curr;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```Python3 []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n == 0 or n == 1:\\n            return 1\\n        prev, curr = 1, 1\\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\\n            temp = curr\\n            curr = prev + curr\\n            prev = temp\\n        return curr\\n```\\n\\n![CUTE_CAT.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/f7f5193b-c407-4cc3-93ac-969a8ab8aacf_1688305654.6101635.png)\\n\\n\\n**If you found my solution helpful, I would greatly appreciate your upvote, as it would motivate me to continue sharing more solutions.**",

                "content": "## Intuition and Approach\\nWe can climb $$n$$ stairs by going up 1 or 2 steps at a time. So if we\\'re currently on step $$i$$, the only places we could get to in one iteration would be steps $$i + 1$$ (if we take 1 step) and $$i + 2$$ (if we take 2 steps).\\n\\nThis means that if we are currently on step $$n$$, our final destination, we could have only gotten there in one of two ways:\\n1. From step $$n - 1$$ , having gone up 1 step to $$n$$\\n2. From step $$n - 2$$, having gone up 2 steps to $$n$$\\n\\nThis highlights that the number of ways to reach step $$n$$ depends on the number of ways to get to step $$n - 1$$ **and** the number of ways to get to step $$n - 2$$. Since both of the above possibilities are valid choices, the number of ways to get to $$n$$ is going to be their **sum**. Thus, we have the following relationship (formally called a **recurrence relation**): $$ways(n) = ways(n - 1) + ways(n - 2)$$\\n\\nLooking at the problem constraints, we see that the smallest possible value of $$n$$ is 1. If we are asked to climb 1 step, the above relationship will not work because $$ways(0)$$ and $$ways(-1)$$ are not defined. More formally, we haven\\'t defined our recurrence\\'s **base case(s)**. We calculate this base case manually: there\\'s only 1 way to climb a singular step - just climb that step! We couldn\\'t possibly take 2 steps in this situation, because then we\\'d be climbing more steps than there are to climb. We notice that if $$n = 2$$, the relationship will also not hold because $$ways(0)$$ is still undefined. Calculating this base case is slightly more involved, but still easy: we can either climb the 2 steps by taking 2 steps, or climb 1 step twice, for a total of 2 ways to climb.\\n\\nTo recap, we have the following relationship, depending on the value of $$n$$:\\n- $$ways(1) = 1 \\\\text{ for } n = 1$$\\n- $$ways(2) = 2 \\\\text{ for } n = 2$$\\n- $$ways(n) = ways(n - 1) + ways(n - 2) \\\\text{ for } n > 2$$\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## **Implementation**\\nWe\\'ll explore multiple approaches from simple to more complex, incrementally improving upon each solution. \\n\\n##### **1. Naive recursion**\\nWe can translate the recurrence we came up with earlier into code, as follows:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n == 1:\\n            return 1\\n        if n == 2:\\n            return 2\\n        else:\\n            return self.climbStairs(n - 1) + self.climbStairs(n - 2)\\n```\\n\\nHowever, running this yields Time Limit Exceeded. Why is it so inefficient? Let\\'s think about calculating the ways to climb 6 stairs,  `climbStairs(6)`.\\n```\\n                                       climbStairs(6)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t /               \\\\\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcS(5)       +          cS(4)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t           /    \\\\                  /    \\\\\\n\\t\\t\\t               cS(4)   +   cS(3)         cS(3) + cS(2)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   /  \\\\        /   \\\\         /   \\\\\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      cS(3) + cS(2) cS(2) + cS(1) cS(2) + cS(1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  /  \\\\\\n\\t\\t\\t     cS(2) + cS(1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see from the recursion tree above, we are calculating `climbStairs(4)` and `climbStairs(3)` multiple times. Specifically, `climbStairs(4)` is being recalculated twice, while `climbStairs(3)` is being recalculated 3 times. If you think about what happens for larger values of `n`, you can see that we are recalculating a lot of values! \\n\\n**Complexity**\\n* **Time**: Each additional level in the recursion tree is going to have double the amount of calls to `climbingStairs` than the one above it. For $$n$$, this gives us a staggering $$2^n$$ function calls, for a $$O(2^n)$$ time complexity. No wonder we get TLE!\\n* **Space**: We aren\\'t storing any additional variables, so that\\'s a $$O(1)$$ space complexity.\\n\\n\\nCan we avoid repeated computation?\\n\\n##### **2. Memoization (Top-Down DP)** \\nWhat if instead of recomputing each value of `climbStairs`, we made sure to save the unique values (such as `climbingStairs(5)`), trading space for time? That\\'s what a top-down dynamic programming approach called **memoization** is. We make use of a dictionary `memo` in which we store the values of `climbStairs` that we have computed, and if we ever have to compute that value again we just check `memo` in (average) $$O(1)$$ time instead of doing the work all over again. \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        def climb(n):  # inner function to make code simpler\\n            if n in memo:\\n                return memo[n]\\n            else:\\n                memo[n] = climb(n-1) + climb(n-2)\\n                return memo[n]\\n        memo = {1: 1, 2: 2}  # base cases\\n        return climb(n)\\n```\\n\\nWe can also make use of Python\\'s handy `@cache` function decorator that does this for us in the background like so:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n\\t@cache\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n == 1:\\n            return 1\\n        if n == 2:\\n            return 2\\n        else:\\n            return self.climbStairs(n - 1) + self.climbStairs(n - 2)\\n```\\n\\nThis top-down paradigm works well when we approach the problem from the top of the stairs (the last step we needed to climb, $$n$$) down. \\n\\n**Complexity**\\n* **Time**: There are $$O(n)$$ distinct subproblems to solve, each requiring only $$O(1)$$ amount of work of getting the values of smaller subproblems from `memo` and adding them together. When we encounter a subproblem we\\'ve already solved, we can get the answer in $$O(1)$$ time.\\n* **Space**: We are using an additional `memo` dictionary that will store the answer to each subproblem, so $$O(n)$$ space complexity.\\n\\nCan we be even more efficient and avoid the overhead of recursion?\\n\\n\\n**3. Bottom-Up DP**\\nTurns out we can build the solution from the ground up (quite literally in this case). From our recurrence relation, we saw that the number of ways to climb $$n$$ stairs depends on the number of ways to climb $$n - 1$$ and $$n - 2$$ stairs. So instead of approaching the problem top-down and computing these values recursively, we compute them bottom-up, starting with the base cases and building upon the previous values until we reach $$n$$. We use a `dp` array of length $$n + 1$$ (to accomodate for the 0-based indexing of Python; we could just have it be length $$n$$ and return `dp[n - 1]` but in this way we are aligning the step numbers with the indices) and successively build up each index from the previous two.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n == 1 or n == 2:\\n            return n\\n        dp = [-1] * (n + 1)  # to accomodate for 0-based indexing \\n        dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2\\n        for i in range(3, n + 1):\\n            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]\\n        return dp[n]\\n            \\n```\\n\\n**Complexity**\\n* **Time**: As before, we are computing each subproblem once and each subproblem requires constant amount of work (just the addition of the previous 2 elements of the array). That\\'s $$O(n)$$time complexity.\\n* **Space**: Since we are storing the answers to previous subproblems in the `dp` array, this will be $$O(n)$$ too.\\n\\nCan we do even better?\\n\\n**4. Optimizied Bottom-Up DP**\\nWhile the above works well enough, we can optimize our approach even further by making a simple but important observation: we are only utilizing the last 2 subproblem answers when solving each subproblem. If you look at the recurrence again, you can see that the only pieces information we use are $$ways(n - 1)$$ and $$ways(n - 2)$$. Since we\\'re computing from bottom-up, once we compute those answers, the smaller subproblems (such as $$ways(n - 3)$$) are not needed anymore. Thus, instead of keeping the entire `dp` array, we can save some space and just maintain 2 variables that track our last 2 subproblem answers!\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n <= 2:\\n            return n\\n        ways = 0\\n\\t\\t# base cases\\n        two_below_curr = 1  # 2 steps below 3 - ways to take 1 step: 1\\n        one_below_curr = 2  # 1 step below 3 - ways to take 2 steps: 2\\n        for i in range(3, n + 1):\\n            # compute number of ways for i\\n            ways = one_below_curr + two_below_curr\\n            # step up to i + 1   \\n            # 1 step below becomes 2 steps below\\n            # current number of ways becomes 1 step below\\n            two_below_curr, one_below_curr = one_below_curr, ways\\n    \\n        return ways\\n```\\n\\n**Complexity**\\n* **Time**: As before, we are computing each subproblem once and each subproblem requires constant amount of work (just the addition of the previous 2 number of ways). That\\'s $$O(n)$$ time complexity.\\n* **Space**: $$O(1)$$ since we are maintaining 3 extra variables only!\\n\\nAnd that\\'s it! We went from a TLE solution to an elegant and optimized version.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

                "content": "**Clean Python | Fibonacci Growth**\\n\\nPython solution similar to the Approach N\\xBA 4 (Fibonacci Growth) discussed in the official LeetCode solution:\\n\\nWe basically consider all steps from 1 to n: ```x=[1,2,3,4,...]```. Here we note that we can only reach step number ```x[i]``` by advancing one step from ```x[i-1]``` or two steps from ```x[i-2]```. Based on this insight, we can say with confidence that the total number of alternatives to reach step number ```x[i]``` is ```N[i] = N[i-1]+N[i-2]``` (sum of alternatives at previous steps). This gives us a Fibonacci growth sequence.\\n\\nThe steps ```[i-1]``` and ```[i-2]``` receive the names ```a``` and ```b``` in the code. If we advance in the array ```[...,b,a]```, we can say that new element in the array will be ```c = a+b```. Therefore, we get ```[..., ,b,a,a+b]```. If we iterate in the loop, we note that our variables are updated as ```b,a = a,a+b```, or reversing the order: ```a,b = a+b,a``` (this is what appears in the code).\\n\\nWe return the value of ```a``` at the end of the function, because this is our last step taken. Now regarding the initialization ```a,b=1,0```, this can be a bit tricky. One way to sense of this would be to think that initially we are at ```n=0``` (before taking one step), but ```n=-1``` is nonsense, so we have one alternative at ```n=0``` and zero alternatives at ```n=-1```. If you follow the first elements in the sequence ```[0,1,...]```, you will see that the upcoming sequence ```[1,2,3,...]``` is formed perfectly with this initialization :)\\n\\nTo be honest, I first thought about this initialization as a small hack to get the code running without if-clauses, because I knew the first element would be ```c = a+b = 1+0 = 1``` for ```n=1```, and then having the initial elements ```[1,1]```, the rest of the code would work perfectly lol.\\n\\nI hope the explanation was helpful.\\nCheers,\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n):\\n        a,b = 1,0\\n        for _ in range(n):\\n            a,b = a+b,a\\n        return a\\n```",

For n<=2, the answer is n itself. For n>2, the solution is obtained by adding the solutions to previous two subproblems. So we obtain the recurrenece relation **F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) for n>2.** The naive approach would be to apply recursion. That is, no doubt absolutely correct but not a very fast solution. Applying recursion would give TLE.\\n\\nThe second approach would be to apply recursion and adding memoization, i.e., storing the solution of smaller problems so that we don\\'t have to calculate them again and again while solving the bigger problem. But that also will give TLE.\\n\\nThe third approach is tabulation method. That is basically iterating manually for values 0 to n. The base cases are known to us(n=0,1,2) and we can simply iterate for values over 2 and store them in the vector named dp. This is the fastest solution and gives the correct answer.\\n\\nHowever, the third approach is still not the best one. We store all the values in an additional vector, using space. We know that our solution depends upon the previous two solutions. So instead of storing all the solutions in a vector, we keep the track of the solutions using three variables - prev1, prev2 and prev3. Initially prev1 = 0(n=0 case), prev2=1(n=1 case) and prev3=2(n=2 case). We take another variable curr and run a loop from i=3 to n, updating each variable acccoringly. This is the best solution, as alongwith being the fastest, it does not take up any extra space as well.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nRecursive Solution - O(2^n)\\nRecursion + Memoization Solution - O(n)\\nTabulation Solution - O(n)\\nTabulation + Space Optimization Solution - O(n)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nRecursive Solution - O(n), due to recursive stack\\nRecursion + Memoization Solution - O(n)+O(n)=O(n), due to recursive stack and dp array\\nTabulation Solution - O(n), due to dp array\\nTabulation + Space Optimization Solution - O(1), as no extra space is being used.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    //RECURSIVE\\n    int solve(int n) {\\n        if(n<=2) return n;\\n\\n        return solve(n-1)+solve(n-2);\\n    }\\n\\n    //RECURSION+MEMOIZATION - TOP DOWN\\n    int solveTD(int n, vector<int> &dp) {\\n        if(n<=2) return n;\\n        if(dp[n]!=-1) return dp[n];\\n        dp[n]=solve(n-1)+solve(n-2);\\n\\n        return dp[n];\\n    }\\n\\n    //BOTTOM UP APPROACH\\n    int solveBU(int n) {\\n        vector<int> dp(n+1,-1);\\n        dp[0]=0;\\n        if(n==0) return dp[0];\\n        dp[1]=1;\\n        if(n==1) return dp[1];\\n        dp[2]=2;\\n\\n        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++) dp[i]=dp[i-1]+dp[i-2];\\n\\n        return dp[n];\\n    }\\n\\n    int solveBUSpace(int n) {\\n        int prev1 = 0;\\n        int prev2 = 1;\\n        int prev3 = 2;\\n        int curr;\\n\\n        if(n==0) return prev1;\\n        if(n==1) return prev2;\\n        if(n==2) return prev3;\\n\\n        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++) {\\n            curr=prev2+prev3;\\n            prev1=prev2;\\n            prev2=prev3;\\n            prev3=curr;\\n        }\\n        return curr;\\n    }\\n\\n    int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        \\n        //RECURSIVE CALL\\n        // return solve(n);\\n\\n        //TOP DOWN CALL\\n        // vector<int> dp(n+1,-1);\\n        // return solveTD(n,dp);\\n\\n        //BOTTOM UP CALL\\n        // return solveBU(n);\\n\\n        //BOTTOM UP WITH SPACE OPTIMIZATION\\n        return solveBUSpace(n);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n![7abc56.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/6bf23c95-e4dd-4836-9464-c2c640159868_1686204613.032207.jpeg)\\n",

The other one is to jump two stairs at the first step, and has T(n-2) choices for the remaining n-2 stairs.

And for n = 3 or > 3 it is: (Output for n - 1) + (Output for n - 2).\\n\\nBecause, for any given n stairs (n >= 3), \\n- if we take 1 step, then we will be left with n - 1 stairs.\\n- and if we take 2 steps, then we will be left with n - 2 stairs.\\n\\nSo, our output will always be: \\n`distinct ways for n stairs = distinct ways for n-1 + distinct ways for n-2`\\n\\nAs our function name is climbStairs, so we can make the formaula using that:\\n`climbStairs(n) = climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2)`\\n\\nSo, the code will be like:\\n```\\nfunction climbStairs(n: number): number {\\n    if (n <= 2) {\\n        return n;\\n    }\\n    return climbStairs(n - 1) + climbStairs(n - 2);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf we submit this solution, it throws runtime error. So we can try to simplify it more:\\n`climbStairs(n) = climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2)`\\n`climbStairs(n) = (climbStairs(n-2) + climbStairs(n-3)) + climbStairs(n-2)`\\n(because climbStairs(n-1) = climbStairs(n-2) + climbStairs(n-3))\\n\\nAs the code is doing recursion and here we can see it was calling climbStairs twice for n-2 case in our code. So, to reduce execution time, we can just call it once and multiply it\\'s answer with 2.\\ni.e.\\n`climbStairs(n) = 2 * climbStairs(n-2) + climbStairs(n-3)`\\n\\nMoreover, as we saw for n = 3 case, that the output is 3 i.e. n. So, we can change our if condition to n <= 3, to reduce execution time more.\\n\\n### Final Code\\nSo this makes our solution:\\n```\\nfunction climbStairs(n: number): number {\\n    if (n <= 3) {\\n        return n;\\n    }\\n    return 2 * climbStairs(n - 2) + climbStairs(n - 3);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nwhich can be simplified to:\\n\\n```\\nfunction climbStairs(n: number): number {\\n    return n <= 3 ? n : 2 * climbStairs(n - 2) + climbStairs(n - 3);\\n}\\n```",

Making step with size `1`, so from step with number `n-1`\\n2. Making step with size `2`, so from step with number `n-2`.\\n\\nSo, if we denote `F[n]` numbers of ways to reach step number `n`, we can write equation: `F[n] = F[n-1] + F[n-2]`. But it is not enough, we also need to define starting cases: `F[1] = 1` and `F[2] = 2`. Or we can say, that `F[0] = 1` and `F[1] = 1`.\\n\\nNow, everything is ready to write our dynamic programming problem.\\n\\n**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)` and space complexity is `O(1)`.\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n):\\n        dp = (1, 1)\\n        for i in range(n-1):\\n            dp = (dp[1], dp[0] + dp[1])\\n        return dp[1]\\n```\\n\\n### Solution 2\\n\\nIf we look carefully at equation `F[n] = F[n-1] + F[n-2]` and starting points, we can see, that we have nothing else, than Fibonacci sequence:\\n\\n`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`\\n\\nNote however, that it is shifted by one position. So, what we need to do is to use Binet formula: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Binet\\'s_formula, where we use computation by rounding.\\n\\n**Complexity**: both time and memory is `O(1)` if we assume that number in `int32` range and if we assume complexity of `**` as `O(1)`.\\n\\n```\\nreturn round((0.5+sqrt(5)/2)**(n+1)/sqrt(5))\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Yeah just One._\\n\\n_Q: How many ways can I climb up to the 2nd step?_\\n_A: Uhmm! Either I take 2 steps from the floor or, I take 1 step from the 1st step._\\n\\n_Q: So how many ways is that?_\\n_A: Two_\\n\\n_Q: Cool, now how many ways can I climb up to the 3rd step?_\\n_A: 2 Ways. Either I take 2 steps from the 1st step or, I take 1 step from the 2nd step._\\n\\n_Q: Nope, to take 1 step from the 2nd step, you need to first reach the 2nd step, and there are more than 1 ways to reach. We need to consider all those ways too. We already calculated it earlier.

                "content": "The key here is that we can climb 1 or 2 steps at each point. Therefore, the number of ways to climb ```n``` steps is equal to the number of ways to climb ```n-1``` steps + the number of ways to climb ```n-2``` steps since we can reach the ```n```th step from either of these two previous steps. This is actually the exact same as the fibonnaci sequence, meaning we can solve this problem exactly like we would solve [509. Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/?envType=study-plan&id=level-1).\\n\\n**Basic Recursion Solution; Time: O(2^N), Space: O(1) --> TLE**\\n```\\ndef climbStairs(self, n):\\n\\tif n <= 2: # there is 1 way to climb up 1 step and 2 ways to climb up 2 steps\\n\\t\\treturn n\\n\\treturn self.climbStairs(n-1)+self.climbStairs(n-2) # we can get to this step from either of the last two steps\\n```\\nThis is the most basic solution, taking advantage of the recursive relationship we explored above. However, it is quite slow and results in a time limit exception because it has a time complextiy of ```O(2^N)``` since we need to make 2 recursive calls at each point and those recursive calls make recursive calls of their own. This can be illustrated with the following diagram about the fibonnaci sequence (credit to [Prateek Narang](https://www.scaler.com/topics/fibonacci-series-in-c/)):\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/0b8e23d2-abd9-4553-b622-5efb833ba81a_1665202511.7852473.png)\\nTo improve on this solution, we can use memoization, one of the core DP techniques. Memoization just means storing our previous results. One way to do this is with python\\'s built in ```@cache```, which stores previous return values from a function call.\\n\\n**Cache Memoization Solution: Time: O(N), Space: O(N)**\\n```\\n@cache # store previous results\\ndef climbStairs(self, n):\\n\\tif n <= 2: # there is 1 way to climb up 1 step and 2 ways to climb up 2 steps\\n\\t\\treturn n\\n\\treturn self.climbStairs(n-1)+self.climbStairs(n-2) # we can get to this step from either of the last two steps\\n```\\nThe time complexity is now ```O(N)``` since we only need to make one calculation for every value from ```1``` to ```n```. The space is also ```O(N)``` since we are now storing the answers to recursive calls to ```climbStairs```. This solution is probably not what an interviewer wants though, so let\\'s store the results ourselves by using a list where the ```i```th index corresponds to the result of ```climbStairs(i+1)```.\\n\\n**List Memoization Solution; Time: O(N), Space: O(N)**\\n```\\ndef climbStairs(self, n):\\n\\tdistinct_ways = [1,2] # 1 way to go up 1 step, 2 ways to go up 2 steps\\n\\tfor i in range(2,n): # go up to n steps\\n\\t\\tdistinct_ways.append(distinct_ways[-1] + distinct_ways[-2]) # can come from either of the last two steps\\n\\treturn distinct_ways[n-1] # how many ways to go up n stairs\\n```\\nThis is a great solution, but we can do even better! When we add the newest number to ```distinct_ways``` , we actually only need to access the previous numbers in ```distinct_ways```, so we can just use a tuple to store the last two!\\n\\n**Optimized Memoization Solution; Time: O(N), Space: O(1)**\\n```\\ndef climbStairs(self, n):\\n\\tif n == 1: # only 1 way to go up 1 step\\n\\t\\treturn 1\\n\\tdistinct_ways = (1,2) # 1 way to go up 1 step, 2 ways to go up 2 steps\\n\\tfor i in range(2,n): # go up to n steps\\n\\t\\tdistinct_ways = (distinct_ways[1], distinct_ways[0] + distinct_ways[1]) # the previous number of ways becomes the second previous number of ways and the previous number of ways becomes the sum of the last two\\n\\treturn distinct_ways[1] # how many ways to go up n stairs\\n```\\n\\n**Thanks for Reading!**\\nIf this post has been helpful, please consider upvoting!

                "content": "**Updates**: Thank StefanPochmann for posting a concise Python implementation of this `O(logn)` idea using matrix power in the first answer. \\n \\n**Note**: If you feel unwilling to read the long codes, just take the idea with you. The codes are unnecessarily long due to the inconvenient handle of matrices. \\n\\nWell, a classic and interesting problem. The recursion is simply `f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)`, which means that we can either climb to `n - 1` and then climb `1` step or climb to `n - 2` and then climb `2` steps. So this problem is actually asking for the `n`-th Fibonacci number. However, if you code it in such a recursive way, it will meet TLE due to the large number of overlapping sub-problems. \\n \\nThere are mainly two ways to solve this problem. The first one uses the above formula in a bottom-up manner and takes `O(n)` time. [This link][1] shares the `O(n)` solution in all the supported languages of the LeetCode OJ. You may take a look at it and appreciate the appetite of each language :-)\\n \\nNow I will focus on another solution, which takes `O(logn)` time. The idea is to use the matrix power. In fact, `[f(n), f(n - 1); f(n - 1), f(n - 2)] = [1, 1; 1, 0] ^ n` for `n >= 2`. And similar to the problem **Pow(x, n)**, the power of a matrix can be computed in `O(logn)` time.\\n  \\nThe C++ and Python codes are shown below. Note that the computation of the power of the matrix `[1, 1; 1, 0]` is hard-coded. Since it is a bit trickier to handle matrix multiplications, the codes become much longer. \\n \\n----------\\n**C++**\\n \\n\\n    class Solution {\\n    public:\\n        int climbStairs(int n) {\\n    \\t\\tif (n < 2) return n;\\n            vector<int> fibs = {1, 1, 1, 0};\\n            vector<int> ans = fibPower(fibs, n);\\n            return ans[0];\\n        }\\n    private:\\n        vector<int> matrixProd(vector<int>& l, vector<int>& r) {\\n            vector<int> ans(4, 0);\\n            ans[0] = l[0] * r[0] + l[1] * r[2];\\n            ans[1] = l[0] * r[1] + l[1] * r[3];\\n            ans[2] = l[2] * r[0] + l[3] * r[2];\\n            ans[3] = l[2] * r[1] + l[3] * r[3]; \\n            return ans;\\n        }\\n        vector<int> fibPower(vector<int>& fibs, int n){\\n    \\t\\tif (n == 1) return fibs;\\n            vector<int> half = fibPower(fibs, n / 2);\\n            vector<int> ans = matrixProd(half, half);\\n            if (n % 2 == 0) return ans;\\n            ans[1] = (ans[0] += ans[1]) - ans[1];\\n            ans[3] = (ans[2] += ans[3]) - ans[3];\\n            return ans;\\n        }\\n    };\\n\\n----------\\n**Python**\\n\\n    class Solution:\\n        # @param {integer} n\\n        # @return {integer}\\n        def climbStairs(self, n):\\n            if n  < 2:\\n                return n\\n            fibs = [1, 1, 1, 0]\\n            ans = self.fibsPower(fibs, n)\\n            return ans[0]\\n        \\n        def matrixProd(self, l, r):\\n            ans = [0] * 4\\n            ans[0] = l[0] * r[0] + l[1] * r[2]\\n            ans[1] = l[0] * r[1] + l[1] * r[3]\\n            ans[2] = l[2] * r[0] + l[3] * r[2]\\n            ans[3] = l[2] * r[1] + l[3] * r[3]\\n            return ans\\n            \\n        def fibsPower(self, fibs, n):\\n            if n == 1:\\n                return fibs\\n            half = self.fibsPower(fibs, n / 2)\\n            ans = self.matrixProd(half, half)\\n            if n % 2 == 0:\\n                return ans\\n            ans[0], ans[1], ans[2], ans[3] = ans[0] + ans[1], ans[0], ans[2] + ans[3], ans[2]\\n            return ans\\n\\n  [1]: https://leetcode.com/discuss/42044/3-4-short-lines-in-every-language",

                "content": "Approach 1: Naive backtracking\\nintuition: to calculate how many ways to reach nth step, we add up how many ways to reach (n-1)th and (n-2)th step, since from (n-1)th step we take a 1-step to get to nth and similarly from (n-2)th step. \\n\\nN = the input\\ntime: recursion tree of depth N, branching factor of 2, runtime is recursion trees is typically O(branching_factor^depth), plugging in we get O(2^N) as our upper bound for runtime. \\nspace: O(N), b/c of depth of recursion stack \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        Naive backtracking\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1\\n        return self.climbStairs(n-1) + self.climbStairs(n-2)\\n```\\n\\nApproach 2: top down memoization\\nintuition: if we draw out the recursion tree we see a lot of repeated work. we are able to see this repeated work because nodes with the same parameters mean that the exact same subproblem is getting recomputed. Drawing out the recursion tree, we see many nodes with the same parameters:\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/f4e6230d-b0ce-4b07-ac35-6e29feeaeab7_1600885828.9303908.png)\\n\\nthis repeated work is a strong indicator that caching can help us here. We make use of python\\'s lru_cache to do caching for us here, based on what arguments are passed into the function. if we want to avoid usage of python\\'s lru cache, we can just as easily mimic this functionality using a dictionary (shown in approach 3).\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        Top down memoization: backtracking\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1\\n        return self.climbStairs(n-1) + self.climbStairs(n-2)\\n        \\n```\\n\\nApproach 3: top down memoization (without lru cache)\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        Top down memoization: backtracking\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        \\n        cache={}\\n        def helper(n):\\n            if n in cache: return cache[n]\\n            if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1\\n            cache[n] = helper(n-1) + helper(n-2)\\n            return cache[n]\\n        \\n        return helper(n)\\n```\\n\\nAnalysis for approach 2 and 3:\\nN=input\\ntime: O(N). we get O(N) time complexity because each subproblem is only solved once, and then the subresult is cached for future use if we need it again. So analyzing time complexity here boils down to how many subproblems are there? Since our input is N, we have N subproblems (1, 2, ..., N-1, N). For analyzing time complexity of these types of problems, it is best to think in terms of what parameters define the subproblems, and use that intuition to figure out how many unique subproblems there are (how many unique parameter sets there are, since parameters define the subproblems).\\nspace: O(N). Space is O(N) because the recursion tree can still hit a depth of O(N) (1-step each time), and also the cache stores O(N) subproblems, so we get a total space complexity of O(N).\\n\\nApproach 4: Dynamic programming (not optimized)\\nintuition:\\n- from thinking about the top down solution, it is clear that in order to get the solution for climbStairs(i), we need the solutions for climbStairs(i-1) and climbStairs(i-2). At first we look at this top down in terms of the recursion tree, but we can instead flip our viewpoint and go from the bottom up. Since we know that at any point i, we need the subproblems for i-1 and i-2, let\\'s just go ahead and calculate the subproblems in order from bottom to top. So we start with the base cases and we build to the solution, instead of starting with the solution we want and figuring out which subproblems we need to solve. \\n\\nanalysis:\\ntime: O(N)\\nspace: O(N)\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        Dynamic programming solution\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        stepsToReachIthPosn=[1] * (n+1)\\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\\n            stepsToReachIthPosn[i] = stepsToReachIthPosn[i-1]+stepsToReachIthPosn[i-2]\\n        return stepsToReachIthPosn[n]\\n```\\nApproach 5: optimized dynamic programming solution\\nintuition:\\n- notice that in our dp solution, we only require the subproblems of i-1 and i-2 in order to solve for ith subproblem. So why waste space and store the whole array when instead we could just store i-1th answer and i-2th answer? and then we just update correspondingly\\n\\ntime: O(N)\\nspace: O(1)\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        Optimized dynamic programming solution\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        oneBack=1\\n        twoBack=1\\n        if n <= 1: return 1\\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\\n            cur=oneBack+twoBack\\n            twoBack=oneBack\\n            oneBack=cur\\n        return oneBack\\n```",

Generally (but not limited to) if the problem statement asks for the following:\\n\\n* Count the total number of ways\\n* Given multiple ways of doing a task, which way will give the minimum or the maximum output.\\n\\nWe can try to apply recursion.

In this recursion is still present but here what we do is store the overlapping subproblems results in hand... as the main problem with recursive approach was that we were solving many sub problems repeatedly.... and so memoization comes into play... In this we store our results in a dp table(here its 1-D) and that would bring reduce the complexity O(n)\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    \\n    static int helper(int n,int *dp){\\n        if(n==0){\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        if(n==1){\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        if(n==2){\\n            return 2;\\n        }\\n        if(dp[n]!=-1){\\n            return dp[n];\\n        }\\n        return dp[n]=helper(n-1,dp) + helper(n-2,dp);\\n    }\\n    \\n    int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        //  Memoized\\n        \\n        int dp[n+1];\\n        for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){\\n            dp[i]=-1;\\n        }\\n        return helper(n,dp);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n#3 Tabulation (Bottom-up)\\n\\nSame as memoization but here iteratively result is evaluated and this method is preferred over memoization due to various stack calls in Top down.... \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        //DP\\n        if(n==0){\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        if(n==1){\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        if(n==2){\\n            return 2;\\n        }\\n        int dp[n+1];\\n        dp[0]=1;\\n        dp[1]=1;\\n        dp[2]=2;\\n        \\n        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){\\n            dp[i]=dp[i-1]+dp[i-2];\\n        }\\n        return dp[n];\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

This step effectively calculates the number of distinct ways to reach the current step (a) and updates the number of distinct ways to reach the next step (b) based on the previous steps\\' counts.\\nAfter the loop finishes executing n times, the method returns the value of b, which represents the number of distinct ways to reach the top of the staircase with n steps.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the number of steps in the staircase. This is because the code iterates n times in the for loop.\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe space complexity of the code is O(1) since the code only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the variables a and b, regardless of the input size.\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        a, b = 0, 1\\n        for i in range(n):\\n\\t        a, b = b, a + b         \\n        return b\\n```",

After that, for each level `i` where `i` is greater than `0` and `1`, we have 2 possible way to step on it: The first one is to go from  `level i - 1` (i.e. climb 1 steps); the second one is to go from `level i - 2` (i.e. climb 2 steps). Thus for each level `i` where `i` is greater than  `1`, `N[i] = N[i - 1] + N[i - 2]`.\\nAnd hence, `N[n]` stores the total number of distinct ways to climb `n` stairs after the `for` loop.  \\n```\\n/*\\nbottom-up approach\\n*/\\n\\npublic int climbStairs(int n){\\n    if (n == 0){\\n        return 1;\\n    }\\n    else{\\n        int[] N = new int[n + 1];\\n        N[0] = 1;\\n        N[1] = 1;\\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i ++){\\n            N[i] = N [ i - 1] + N[i - 2];\\n        }\\n        return N[n];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe top down approach is showed as following. \\nIn the top down approach, we actually consider from the top, which is `stair level n`. And the recursive equation is still `N[i] = N[i - 1] + N[i - 2]`. Hence we get the so-called optimal substructures in `Dynamic programming`. Thus, by recursively calculate each level from `n` to base case, which is `0` and `1` and memorize the intermediate, we can still get the total number of distinct ways to go to stair `n`. \\n```\\n/*\\ntop-down approach\\n*/\\n\\n\\npublic int climbStairs(int n) {\\n    int[] N = new int[n];\\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){\\n        N[i] = -1;\\n    }\\n    \\n    return topdownclimbStairs(n, N);\\n}\\n\\nprivate int topdownclimbStairs(int n, int[] N){\\n    if (n == 0 || n == 1){\\n        return 1;\\n    }\\n    \\n    if (N[n - 1] >= 0){\\n        return N[n - 1];\\n    }\\n\\n    else {\\n        N[n - 1] = topdownclimbStairs(n-1, N) + topdownclimbStairs(n - 2, N);\\n        return N[n - 1];\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

                "content": "This is a very good DP problem based on mathematical proof. I believe many people have the same questions in their mind like I do. Why it\\'s `(n-1)` step + `(n-2)` step, but not `(n-1)` step + `(n-2)` step + `1` since we need to do an additional step to get to stair `n`? I would use [@WX-78](https://leetcode.com/WX-78) \\'s idea to explain. \\n  Think about what happens on the `n`-th step. We can get to stair `n` from `(n-1)` step or from `(n-2)` step. Also, we know there are `x` distinct ways to get to `(n-1)` step, and `y` distinct ways to get to `(n-2)` steps.\\n\\n  1. For `(n-1)`, we just need to add 1 on `x` paths to get to `n` step. It doesn\\'t change the number of `x` paths required to get `(n-1)` step.\\n  2. For `(n-2)`, we need to add 2 on `y` paths to get to `n` step. It also doesn\\'t change the number of `y` paths required to get to `(n-2)` step.\\n  Therefore, we just need to add `(n-1)` step and `(n-2)` step together to get all the possible ways to `n` step. I believe it is still unclear at this point so let\\'s look the **examples** below.\\n\\nFor example 1, what are all the paths leading to `3`:\\n`[1 + 1 + 1]`\\n`    [2 + 1]`\\n`    [1 + 2]`\\nTo get to `5`, we simply need to add `2` to all the possible paths:\\n`[1 + 1 + 1] + 2`\\n`    [2 + 1] + 2`\\n`    [1 + 2] + 2`\\nNow we can see how the magic works here. The number of ways to get from `3` to `5` does not change with this operation, right? We are adding `2`to each sequence, but it just makes each sequence longer **not making more of possible sequences**.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at another example, just in case it\\'s still not clear enough.\\n\\nFor example 2, for `4` we have five possible ways to get to there:\\n`[1 + 1 + 1 + 1]`\\n`    [1 + 1 + 2]`\\n`    [1 + 2 + 1]`\\n`    [2 + 1 + 1]`\\n`        [2 + 2]`\\nTo get to `5`, we need to add `1` to all the possible sequence so we will have:\\n`[1 + 1 + 1 + 1] + 1`\\n`    [1 + 1 + 2] + 1`\\n`    [1 + 2 + 1] + 1`\\n`    [2 + 1 + 1] + 1`\\n`        [2 + 2] + 1`\\nAgain, we can see how the magic works here.

                "content": "So the first intution here is going to be approaching this as a dfs problem similar to the [combination sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/) problem, except now this time, we\\'re only looking at the amount of ways we can sum n with only 1 and 2. \\n\\nSo we begin by drawing a graph of the problem to figure out our next steps and see if we can find a particular pattern. Let\\'s take 4 for example:\\n```\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t4\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   /         \\\\\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     2            3\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t       / \\t\\\\       /    \\\\\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t           1    0      2      1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t         /           /   \\\\      \\\\ \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t            0           1     0       0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      /\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\n```\\nFirst things first, we realize we can use 1 and 2 as our base case, since it\\'s a relatively simple answer, and every branch will always end in a 1 or a 2. \\n\\nThe second thing we can realize is that we can sort of start looking at every solution less than 4 below it. The right hand hand side of the tree gives us the solution of 3, and left hand side gives us the solution for 2. Then the branches of 3 gives us the solution for 2 and 1. We also realize that the sum of the solutions of both sides of the tree gives us the final answer for the root.  So we begin plotting out for funtion f:\\n```\\nf(5) = f(4) + f(3)\\nf(4) = f(3) + f(4)\\nf(3) = f(2) + f(1)\\n```\\nThus we see that for n in range [2, inf]:\\n```\\nf(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)\\n```\\nWhich should look familiar, because this is just a fibonacci sequence!\\nUsing this information, we can create some simple code similiar to the code of the classic fib sequence problem:\\n```\\n# Andres \"Mateo\" Ruiz Flores\\n# 6 January 2022\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n in {1, 2}:\\n            return n\\n        \\n        return self.climbStairs(n - 1) + self.climbStairs(n - 2)\\n```\\nIn this solution, since the longest branch is going to be us just repeatingly subtracting 1 from n, n is going to be our tree height, and thus our space complexity from our stack will be O(n). \\nSince for n tree height we are going to have a worst case of 2^n nodes (you can test this out yourself by drawing a tree, with each node having exactly two children), then the time complexity for this solution is O(2^n). \\n\\nThis solution is clearly not an efficient one, so we are going to try to see how we can speed things up. One thing we can usually do whenever we are dealing with recursion is memoizing. And since we have a bunch of branches that repeat, this is the perfect opportunity to utalize it. \\n\\nSo if we are calculating a large number like 45, instead of calculating the solution for any n less than 44 multiple times, we can just calculate it once, and hold the solution we find in a dictionary. That way, whenever we come accross the need to find the solution for the same number in the future, we can solve it in O(1) time. \\n\\nSince recursion sort of works like dfs, and we are doing n - 1 first, we\\'re going to have the solution for every number up to n before we even start going to any of the right branches. Since at that point all of the solutions for the right branches are found and only require O(1) lookup time, the only calculations we\\'re doing is the left branches which are made up of n nodes. \\nThus, our new time complexity should be O(n), all while our space complexity should stay the same, since we\\'re only storing up to n solutions in the dictionary.\\n\\nAwesomely enough, we can achieve this through just a few edits of our old code:\\n```\\n# Andres \"Mateo\" Ruiz Flores\\n# 6 January 2022\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    def climbStairs(self, n: int, memo = {1:1, 2:2}) -> int:\\n        if n in memo:\\n            return memo[n]\\n        \\n        memo[n] = self.climbStairs(n - 1, memo) + self.climbStairs(n - 2, memo)\\n        \\n        return memo[n]\\n```\\n\\nLet me know if there are any questions or sugestions!\\nIf you want to look further into it, I recommend looking at the first problem solved in the dynamic programming video offered by freecodecamp.",

The answer is to use a brute force recursive backtracking solution to try every single path we can take.\\n\\nHere\\'s a visualization at N=4\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/557539f6-041c-4937-b5b2-08c6a28d8b39_1608097912.1572409.png)\\n\\nStarting from N=4, we will try every combination until we reach either 0 or a negative answer. We will then count the number of answers that we found.\\n\\nSpecifically we have:\\n* Base case: N=0, return 1, we found a unique path\\n* Base Case: N < 0, return 0, invalid path\\n* Recursive Case: Stairs(N-1) + Stairs(N-2)\\n\\nThe code for this is here:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        return helper(n);\\n    }\\n    \\n    private int helper(int n) {\\n        if (n == 0) {\\n            // base case where we arrived at an answer\\n            return 1;\\n        } else if (n < 0) {\\n            // base case where we went too far\\n            return 0;  \\n        } else {\\n            // recursive case where we try taking 1 step\\n            // and 2 steps, adding the unique permuation\\n            // of steps back\\n            return helper(n-1) + helper(n-2);\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow if you look back at the graph, you might notice that we have repeated calculations that we make, like n=1 or n=2:\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/f634ccc0-09ca-4bfd-99fb-3b8a98f5b163_1608098166.53452.png)\\n\\nThe goal of DP is to save the answers we calculated at each of these sub-problems and re-use them if we ever see them again. We accomplish this by using an array to store the number of path at each stair. For example n=1 will always have 1 unique path.\\n\\nBy re-using the answer that we\\'ve calculated, we can save on runtime complexity which makes DP so powerful\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/67cd3722-9e9a-4c74-ac0d-60fc510402f8_1608098320.1190197.png)\\n\\nThe only big change to our brute force recursive code is that we use an array to store the answers to each step that we calculate in the recursive case and that reuse it if we ever see it again as one of our base cases.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the code looks like:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    private int[] memo; \\n    public int climbStairs(int n) {\\n        // instantiate the datastructure to cache the calculation\\n        // to each of our subproblems. i.e. what step we are on\\n        memo = new int[n+1];\\n        return helper(n);\\n    }\\n    \\n    private int helper(int n) {\\n        if (n < 0) {\\n            return 0;\\n        } else if (memo[n] != 0) {\\n            // If we stored something in our cache reuse it and avoid\\n            // recalculating everything\\n            return memo[n];\\n        } else if (n == 0) {\\n            return 1;\\n        } else {\\n            // store our calculation inside our cache so we don\\'t \\n            // have to recalculate it again for memo[n]\\n            memo[n] = helper(n-1) + helper(n-2);\\n            return memo[n];\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, DP problems aren\\'t too hard.

To get to the third stair, we either take one step from `2` or two steps from `1`, which implies `A3 = A1 + A2`. In general, the inductive step to determine all values then is `A(k) = A(k-1) + A(k-2)`.

If we climb 1 stair, we have 2 stairs left, which is the situation for \"N = 2\", which is 2 ways; and if we climb 2 stairs, we have 1 stair left, which is the situation for \"N = 2\", which is 1 way.

Does anyone know of a good proof of it?\\n\\n**Here\\'s my take at explaining it:**\\n(Assume the function f(n) returns the number of ways to get to step n). \\n\\nSuppose we have 3 steps (n=3). We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

If we climb 1 stair, we have 2 stairs left, which is the situation for \"N = 2\", which is 2 ways; and if we climb 2 stairs, we have 1 stair left, which is the situation for \"N = 2\", which is 1 way.

For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2.

So total 2 + 1 = 3 ways\\n\\nWhat if N = 4?\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/93e68f1f-0a72-4d3c-b3fc-d3721917da83_1626335339.4824002.png)\\nAgain, we can only climb 1 stair or 2 stairs for the first step. If we climb 1 stair, we will have 3 stairs left, which is the situation for \"N = 3\", which is 3 ways; and if we climb 2 stairs, we will have 2 stairs left, which is the situation for \"N = 2\", which is 2 ways. So in total 3 + 2 = 5 ways.\\n\\nWe can find that if there is x stairs(x is a number), the number of ways to climb is the ways to climb x-1 plus the ways to climb x-2:\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/23937255-277a-4201-9210-3a16dcd9878d_1626335589.7534728.png)\\nwhich, is the famous fibonacci sequence that \"each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1\"\\n\\n"

We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2.

For every way of reaching level n - 1, we can only take 1 step at the end to get level n. So, we have x1 ways to reach level n by taking 1 step at the last move. \\nSimilarly, for the two steps case, we need to be at the level n - 2, and say we has x2 ways to get level n - 2. For every way of reaching level n - 2, we can only take 2 stpes at the end to get level n.

We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

Does anyone know of a good proof of it?\\n\\n**Here\\'s my take at explaining it:**\\n(Assume the function f(n) returns the number of ways to get to step n). \\n\\nSuppose we have 3 steps (n=3). We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

If we climb 1 stair, we have 2 stairs left, which is the situation for \"N = 2\", which is 2 ways; and if we climb 2 stairs, we have 1 stair left, which is the situation for \"N = 2\", which is 1 way.

For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2.

So total 2 + 1 = 3 ways\\n\\nWhat if N = 4?\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/93e68f1f-0a72-4d3c-b3fc-d3721917da83_1626335339.4824002.png)\\nAgain, we can only climb 1 stair or 2 stairs for the first step. If we climb 1 stair, we will have 3 stairs left, which is the situation for \"N = 3\", which is 3 ways; and if we climb 2 stairs, we will have 2 stairs left, which is the situation for \"N = 2\", which is 2 ways. So in total 3 + 2 = 5 ways.\\n\\nWe can find that if there is x stairs(x is a number), the number of ways to climb is the ways to climb x-1 plus the ways to climb x-2:\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/23937255-277a-4201-9210-3a16dcd9878d_1626335589.7534728.png)\\nwhich, is the famous fibonacci sequence that \"each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1\"\\n\\n"

We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2.

For every way of reaching level n - 1, we can only take 1 step at the end to get level n. So, we have x1 ways to reach level n by taking 1 step at the last move. \\nSimilarly, for the two steps case, we need to be at the level n - 2, and say we has x2 ways to get level n - 2. For every way of reaching level n - 2, we can only take 2 stpes at the end to get level n.

We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

Does anyone know of a good proof of it?\\n\\n**Here\\'s my take at explaining it:**\\n(Assume the function f(n) returns the number of ways to get to step n). \\n\\nSuppose we have 3 steps (n=3). We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

If we climb 1 stair, we have 2 stairs left, which is the situation for \"N = 2\", which is 2 ways; and if we climb 2 stairs, we have 1 stair left, which is the situation for \"N = 2\", which is 1 way.

For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

We can either get to step 2 and to step 3, or we can skip step 2 and go directly from 1 to 3. For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

For the first case, there are exactly f(2) ways of going to step 3 while stepping on 2, since from step 2 there is only one way of getting to step 3. For the second case, we could have jumped over step 2. There would be f(1) ways of getting to step 1, and only one way from there to get to step 3 without stepping on 2. Therefore the total number of ways for getting to 3 is f(2)+f(1). QED. \\n\\nThis can be generalized by changing 1,2,3 in my example for n-2, n-1 and n respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n"

Now realize that you only need extra step to get to the ith stair. Now if you are thinking about n[i-1] + 1, it is wrong because you are thinking of the number of steps, not the number of combinations. \\n\\nLet\\'s make the problem easier: You HAVE to take ONE step, not two, on the LAST step. Imagine i is 6, and you are on the 5nd step, and now just say, that when you go from the 5th step to the 6th step, you will ALWAYS just take one more step to go to the 6th step, thus the number of combinations stays the SAME. Because all the combinations where you go to the 5th step, you are just taking another step, meaning the combination for all the 6th step will be the same as the 5th step, only you are taking another step at the end, and since it\\'s # of combinations, not # of steps.\\n\\nNow going back to the solution: n[i] = n[i-1] + n[i-2], realize that you also have to take in account for the fact that someone can go up 2 steps from i-2th step to ith step. Thus that\\'s why you add n[i-2], because it\\'s the same inituition. If you can only take a double step at the end, then the # of combinations will just be n[i-2] because it\\'s the same combination as n[i-2] except you just taking 2 more steps at the end.\\n\\nSince you can take 1 step at the end or 2 steps at the end, adding the two situtations together, it is n[i] = n[i-1] + n[i-2]."

Because all the combinations where you go to the 5th step, you are just taking another step, meaning the combination for all the 6th step will be the same as the 5th step, only you are taking another step at the end, and since it\\'s # of combinations, not # of steps.\\n\\nNow going back to the solution: n[i] = n[i-1] + n[i-2], realize that you also have to take in account for the fact that someone can go up 2 steps from i-2th step to ith step. Thus that\\'s why you add n[i-2], because it\\'s the same inituition. If you can only take a double step at the end, then the # of combinations will just be n[i-2] because it\\'s the same combination as n[i-2] except you just taking 2 more steps at the end.\\n\\nSince you can take 1 step at the end or 2 steps at the end, adding the two situtations together, it is n[i] = n[i-1] + n[i-2]."

Imagine i is 6, and you are on the 5nd step, and now just say, that when you go from the 5th step to the 6th step, you will ALWAYS just take one more step to go to the 6th step, thus the number of combinations stays the SAME. Because all the combinations where you go to the 5th step, you are just taking another step, meaning the combination for all the 6th step will be the same as the 5th step, only you are taking another step at the end, and since it\\'s # of combinations, not # of steps.\\n\\nNow going back to the solution: n[i] = n[i-1] + n[i-2], realize that you also have to take in account for the fact that someone can go up 2 steps from i-2th step to ith step. Thus that\\'s why you add n[i-2], because it\\'s the same inituition. If you can only take a double step at the end, then the # of combinations will just be n[i-2] because it\\'s the same combination as n[i-2] except you just taking 2 more steps at the end.\\n\\nSince you can take 1 step at the end or 2 steps at the end, adding the two situtations together, it is n[i] = n[i-1] + n[i-2]."

Imagine i is 6, and you are on the 5nd step, and now just say, that when you go from the 5th step to the 6th step, you will ALWAYS just take one more step to go to the 6th step, thus the number of combinations stays the SAME. Because all the combinations where you go to the 5th step, you are just taking another step, meaning the combination for all the 6th step will be the same as the 5th step, only you are taking another step at the end, and since it\\'s # of combinations, not # of steps.\\n\\nNow going back to the solution: n[i] = n[i-1] + n[i-2], realize that you also have to take in account for the fact that someone can go up 2 steps from i-2th step to ith step. Thus that\\'s why you add n[i-2], because it\\'s the same inituition. If you can only take a double step at the end, then the # of combinations will just be n[i-2] because it\\'s the same combination as n[i-2] except you just taking 2 more steps at the end.\\n\\nSince you can take 1 step at the end or 2 steps at the end, adding the two situtations together, it is n[i] = n[i-1] + n[i-2]."

Imagine i is 6, and you are on the 5nd step, and now just say, that when you go from the 5th step to the 6th step, you will ALWAYS just take one more step to go to the 6th step, thus the number of combinations stays the SAME. Because all the combinations where you go to the 5th step, you are just taking another step, meaning the combination for all the 6th step will be the same as the 5th step, only you are taking another step at the end, and since it\\'s # of combinations, not # of steps.\\n\\nNow going back to the solution: n[i] = n[i-1] + n[i-2], realize that you also have to take in account for the fact that someone can go up 2 steps from i-2th step to ith step. Thus that\\'s why you add n[i-2], because it\\'s the same inituition. If you can only take a double step at the end, then the # of combinations will just be n[i-2] because it\\'s the same combination as n[i-2] except you just taking 2 more steps at the end.\\n\\nSince you can take 1 step at the end or 2 steps at the end, adding the two situtations together, it is n[i] = n[i-1] + n[i-2]."

For example, 1 1 1 1 would be a way to get to step 4. There are of course other ways to get to step 4 though, such as 2 1 1. \n\nSo why is it that the total number of ways to get to 4 is just the number of ways to get to 3 + the number of ways to get to 2?\n\nWell imagine you get a different person to step each of the unique ways to get to step 2. They all end up on step 2, they just took different sequences of steps to get there. Now you tell them all to take a **double** step to step 4. The key realization is that **you didn't increase the number of unique paths that have been stepped, you've just extended them all to end on 4, instead of ending on 2**. This must be the case, since each person represents one of the unique ways, and you didn't need to add any extra people, just tell them to take another step. \n\nNow imagine you repeat the process for step 3. They all end up standing on step 3 having taken a unique way there, and then you tell them all to take a **single** step to step 4. Once again, **you didn't increase the number of unique paths/ways**, you've just extended them all in length by 1 more step, so that now they end on step 4, instead of step 3.\n\nSo what `ways[i-1] + ways[i-2]` really means is that you're taking all the unique paths to step i-1 and step i-2, and then extending the i-1 paths by a single step, and extending all the i-2 by a double step, making all those unique paths now end on step i. Note that no new paths were made, you just extended already known paths.\n\nDrawing up the ways for steps 1 to 4 may help visualize this:\n\n```\nThe ways to step 1 =\n1\n\nThe ways to step 2 =\n1 1\n2\n\nThe ways to step 3 =\n   all the ways to step 1 plus a double step\n   1, 2\n   + all the ways to step 2 plus a single step\n   1 1, 1\n   2, 1\n\nThe ways to step 4 =\n   all the ways to step 2 plus a double step\n   1 1, 2\n   2, 2\n   + all the ways to step 3 plus a single step\n   1 2, 1\n   1 1 1, 1\n   2 1, 1\n```"

For example, 1 1 1 1 would be a way to get to step 4. There are of course other ways to get to step 4 though, such as 2 1 1. \n\nSo why is it that the total number of ways to get to 4 is just the number of ways to get to 3 + the number of ways to get to 2?\n\nWell imagine you get a different person to step each of the unique ways to get to step 2. They all end up on step 2, they just took different sequences of steps to get there. Now you tell them all to take a **double** step to step 4. The key realization is that **you didn't increase the number of unique paths that have been stepped, you've just extended them all to end on 4, instead of ending on 2**. This must be the case, since each person represents one of the unique ways, and you didn't need to add any extra people, just tell them to take another step. \n\nNow imagine you repeat the process for step 3. They all end up standing on step 3 having taken a unique way there, and then you tell them all to take a **single** step to step 4. Once again, **you didn't increase the number of unique paths/ways**, you've just extended them all in length by 1 more step, so that now they end on step 4, instead of step 3.\n\nSo what `ways[i-1] + ways[i-2]` really means is that you're taking all the unique paths to step i-1 and step i-2, and then extending the i-1 paths by a single step, and extending all the i-2 by a double step, making all those unique paths now end on step i. Note that no new paths were made, you just extended already known paths.\n\nDrawing up the ways for steps 1 to 4 may help visualize this:\n\n```\nThe ways to step 1 =\n1\n\nThe ways to step 2 =\n1 1\n2\n\nThe ways to step 3 =\n   all the ways to step 1 plus a double step\n   1, 2\n   + all the ways to step 2 plus a single step\n   1 1, 1\n   2, 1\n\nThe ways to step 4 =\n   all the ways to step 2 plus a double step\n   1 1, 2\n   2, 2\n   + all the ways to step 3 plus a single step\n   1 2, 1\n   1 1 1, 1\n   2 1, 1\n```"

This must be the case, since each person represents one of the unique ways, and you didn't need to add any extra people, just tell them to take another step. \n\nNow imagine you repeat the process for step 3. They all end up standing on step 3 having taken a unique way there, and then you tell them all to take a **single** step to step 4. Once again, **you didn't increase the number of unique paths/ways**, you've just extended them all in length by 1 more step, so that now they end on step 4, instead of step 3.\n\nSo what `ways[i-1] + ways[i-2]` really means is that you're taking all the unique paths to step i-1 and step i-2, and then extending the i-1 paths by a single step, and extending all the i-2 by a double step, making all those unique paths now end on step i. Note that no new paths were made, you just extended already known paths.\n\nDrawing up the ways for steps 1 to 4 may help visualize this:\n\n```\nThe ways to step 1 =\n1\n\nThe ways to step 2 =\n1 1\n2\n\nThe ways to step 3 =\n   all the ways to step 1 plus a double step\n   1, 2\n   + all the ways to step 2 plus a single step\n   1 1, 1\n   2, 1\n\nThe ways to step 4 =\n   all the ways to step 2 plus a double step\n   1 1, 2\n   2, 2\n   + all the ways to step 3 plus a single step\n   1 2, 1\n   1 1 1, 1\n   2 1, 1\n```"

For example, 1 1 1 1 would be a way to get to step 4. There are of course other ways to get to step 4 though, such as 2 1 1. \n\nSo why is it that the total number of ways to get to 4 is just the number of ways to get to 3 + the number of ways to get to 2?\n\nWell imagine you get a different person to step each of the unique ways to get to step 2. They all end up on step 2, they just took different sequences of steps to get there. Now you tell them all to take a **double** step to step 4.

For example, 1 1 1 1 would be a way to get to step 4. There are of course other ways to get to step 4 though, such as 2 1 1. \n\nSo why is it that the total number of ways to get to 4 is just the number of ways to get to 3 + the number of ways to get to 2?\n\nWell imagine you get a different person to step each of the unique ways to get to step 2. They all end up on step 2, they just took different sequences of steps to get there. Now you tell them all to take a **double** step to step 4. The key realization is that **you didn't increase the number of unique paths that have been stepped, you've just extended them all to end on 4, instead of ending on 2**. This must be the case, since each person represents one of the unique ways, and you didn't need to add any extra people, just tell them to take another step. \n\nNow imagine you repeat the process for step 3. They all end up standing on step 3 having taken a unique way there, and then you tell them all to take a **single** step to step 4. Once again, **you didn't increase the number of unique paths/ways**, you've just extended them all in length by 1 more step, so that now they end on step 4, instead of step 3.\n\nSo what `ways[i-1] + ways[i-2]` really means is that you're taking all the unique paths to step i-1 and step i-2, and then extending the i-1 paths by a single step, and extending all the i-2 by a double step, making all those unique paths now end on step i. Note that no new paths were made, you just extended already known paths.\n\nDrawing up the ways for steps 1 to 4 may help visualize this:\n\n```\nThe ways to step 1 =\n1\n\nThe ways to step 2 =\n1 1\n2\n\nThe ways to step 3 =\n   all the ways to step 1 plus a double step\n   1, 2\n   + all the ways to step 2 plus a single step\n   1 1, 1\n   2, 1\n\nThe ways to step 4 =\n   all the ways to step 2 plus a double step\n   1 1, 2\n   2, 2\n   + all the ways to step 3 plus a single step\n   1 2, 1\n   1 1 1, 1\n   2 1, 1\n```"

For example, 1 1 1 1 would be a way to get to step 4. There are of course other ways to get to step 4 though, such as 2 1 1. \n\nSo why is it that the total number of ways to get to 4 is just the number of ways to get to 3 + the number of ways to get to 2?\n\nWell imagine you get a different person to step each of the unique ways to get to step 2. They all end up on step 2, they just took different sequences of steps to get there. Now you tell them all to take a **double** step to step 4. The key realization is that **you didn't increase the number of unique paths that have been stepped, you've just extended them all to end on 4, instead of ending on 2**. This must be the case, since each person represents one of the unique ways, and you didn't need to add any extra people, just tell them to take another step. \n\nNow imagine you repeat the process for step 3. They all end up standing on step 3 having taken a unique way there, and then you tell them all to take a **single** step to step 4. Once again, **you didn't increase the number of unique paths/ways**, you've just extended them all in length by 1 more step, so that now they end on step 4, instead of step 3.\n\nSo what `ways[i-1] + ways[i-2]` really means is that you're taking all the unique paths to step i-1 and step i-2, and then extending the i-1 paths by a single step, and extending all the i-2 by a double step, making all those unique paths now end on step i. Note that no new paths were made, you just extended already known paths.\n\nDrawing up the ways for steps 1 to 4 may help visualize this:\n\n```\nThe ways to step 1 =\n1\n\nThe ways to step 2 =\n1 1\n2\n\nThe ways to step 3 =\n   all the ways to step 1 plus a double step\n   1, 2\n   + all the ways to step 2 plus a single step\n   1 1, 1\n   2, 1\n\nThe ways to step 4 =\n   all the ways to step 2 plus a double step\n   1 1, 2\n   2, 2\n   + all the ways to step 3 plus a single step\n   1 2, 1\n   1 1 1, 1\n   2 1, 1\n```"

Basically, until we have no steps to take, the number of ways that you can reach N with I steps already taken is determined by the result of memo[i + 1] + memo[i + 2]. Or in other words, taking 1 step vs 2 steps. If I becomes greater than N, we return 0. If I == N, we return 1. Otherwise if we're at a spot in memo that we've already calculated (memo[i] != -1) then we can just return memo[i] without having to recalculate an answer that we've already gotten.

                "content": "Inspired by Vivekanand Kiruban from [link](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-design-a-rand7-function-using-a-rand5-function).\\n\\nThere are three concepts in geometric distribution you need to know before you solve these kind of questions. They are very easy to understand.\\n\\n# Expanding a zero-based `random`\\n\\nLet\\'s say you have a `random10` which return a number from 0 to 9. How would you build `random100` which return from 0 to 99? \\nYou can call `random10` to generate each digit.  Specifically, `10*random10()` will generate the tens\\' place for a two digit number, and `1*random10()` will generate the ones\\' place. Then the biggest number `10*random10() + 1*random10()`  could produce is 10*9+1*9 = 99. The smallest number is `0`\\n```\\nrandom100 = 10*random10() + 1*random10()\\nrandom1000 = 100*random10() + 10*random10() + 1*random10()\\n```\\n\\nIf we change our definition of `random`, now `random10` will return a number from 1 to 10. Can we use the above formula to generate `random100`(1 to 100)? \\n\\nThe answer is **NO**.\\n\\nIf you think about it, the `10*random10() + 1*random10()` can only return a number from ~~2 to 101~~ 11 to 110., instead of 1 to 100.\\n\\nYou need to tweak the formula a little bit. Specifically, you need to zero-based your `random`.\\n\\n```\\nrandom100 = 10*(random10()-1) + 1*(random10()-1) + 1\\n```\\n\\nNotice that we need to `add 1` in the end because `10*(random10()-1) + 1*(random10()-1)` will result in a number from 0 to 99, and what we want is actually 1 to 100.\\n\\n# Discarding and Rolling again\\nIf you have a 6 sided dice and want to use it determine \"Head or Tail\" using this side, and if you get 1, say heads, if you get 2, say tails, and if you get anything else, you discard them by rolling again. This approach will guarantee an equivalent to H/T, but notice you may be rolling the die many times.\\n\\n# Folding to Map\\nIn the above example of dice, an another solution you have is mapping the other values into `H` or `T`. For example, 1,2,3 (= heads), 4,5,6 (= tails). When it comes to implementation, we can use module operator to do that.\\nE.g,\\n```\\nrandom3 = random6 % 3 // Assuming the random here is zero-based\\n```\\n\\n# Use the three concepts\\nWhat we have right now is 1-based random7, and we need to generate random10. Here are the steps we gonna go through:\\n1. zero-based `random7`: `random7-1`(0..6)\\n2. expanding zero-based `random7` to zero-based `random49`: `(random7-1)*7 + (random7-1)`\\n3. discarding the number over 40 by rolling again, then we get zero-based `random40`: \\n\\t```\\n\\twhile(random40>=40){\\n\\t\\trandom40 = (random7-1)*7 + (random7-1)\\n\\t}\\n\\t```\\n4. folding zero-based `random40` to one-based `random10`\\n\\t```\\n\\trandom10 = random40%10+1\\n\\t```\\n\\n\\nThe complete code:\\n```\\nclass Solution extends SolBase {\\n    public int rand10() {\\n        int rand40 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n        while (rand40 >= 40) {\\n            rand40 = (rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7() - 1;\\n        }\\n        return rand40 % 10 + 1;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Easy, because you do not have a lot of choice what to do, difficult, because we need to use not very big number of generations. Can we use one number between `1` and `7` to generate number between `1` and `10`? I do not think so, we have very small choice. Can we use `2`? Yes, we can, here is the strategy:\\n1. Generate `a` from `1` to `7` and `b` from `1` to `7`, then we have `7x7 = 49` options. Let us create number `c = (a-1)*7 + b-1`, then we can show that `c` is number between `0` and `48`: substitute all possible values for `a` and `b` and you will see. \\n2. Now, let us divide these number into groups: `[0,9]; [10;19]; [20;29]; [30;39]; [40;48]`. If we get into one of the first four group we are happy: there is ten number in each group, so we just return `c%10 + 1`.\\n3. If we are in the fifth group, we are not happy, there are only `9` numbers in this group and we need `10`, use `9` is not fair. So in these case, we say, that our experiment was not working, and we just start it all over again! That is all.\\n\\n**Complexity**: what we do here is called sampling with rejection. Success of first sampling is `p = 40/49`. If first time our sampling was not working and it worked second time we have `(1-p)*p`, if it worked third time it is `(1-p)*(1-p)*p` and so on. Each time we use two `rand7()` generation. So, overall our **expectation** is `2*p + 4*(1-p)*p + 6*(1-p)^2*p + ...` How to compute it?

Bear with me!\\n\\nFirst of all we declare 2 variables, `n` and `m`, settimg them initially to be `rand7()` and `7`.\\n\\nThen we make sure tha `n` is only in the `1 - 5` range and, if not, we regenerate it and assign `n - 5` to `m`, that thus would be in the `1 - 2` range. Notice that in this way `n` and `m` have the same probabiliy of still being each specific number in their own range.\\n\\nIn the second loop, we make sure that `m` has a `1 - 6` value, with similar logic of regenerating numbers until we need them.\\n\\nFinally we return `n` + either `0` or `5`, depending if `m` is even or odd, respectively.\\n\\nThis gives us perfectly distributed numbers :)\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int n, m;\\n    int rand10() {\\n        // initialising the values\\n\\t\\tn = rand7(), m = 7;\\n        // making sure n is in the right 1-5 range and, if we can, we settle m too\\n\\t\\twhile (n > 5) {\\n            m = n - 5;\\n            n = rand7();\\n        }\\n        // if m was not settled, we do it here\\n\\t\\twhile (m == 7) m = rand7();\\n        return (m % 2 ? 5 : 0) + n;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

So, don\\'t read this, you will not find anything useful here. I just retain text below for history.\\n\\n---\\n---\\n---\\n\\n**Previous title:** `O(constant) worst-case. Never presented before!`\\n\\nWe know how to generate smaller `rand` using larger `rand` using rejection sampling. But can you do reverse without generating a larger `rand`? Yes, and this approach works without `O(\\u221E)` time worst-case.\\n\\nImagine you want to generate `rand3` by knowing `rand2`. We need to distribute same probabilities on `1`, on `2` and on `3`. Let\\'s call `rand2` three times and smartly map our numbers:\\n* `rand2` \\u2192 `{1, 2}` = `a`\\n* `rand2` \\u2192 `{1, 3}` = `b`\\n* `rand2` \\u2192 `{2, 3}` = `c`\\n\\nEach number in `[1, 3]` range shows exactly twice. What next can we do with these numbers? We can sum them up. If we do so, then we will get these numbers:\\n`s` = `a + b + c` =\\n* `4` with probability `1`/9\\n* `5` with probability `2`/9\\n* `6` with probability `3`/9\\n* `7` with probability `2`/9\\n* `8` with probability `1`/9\\n\\nIf we make `(s-1) % 3` then we will get these numbers and probabilities:\\n* `0` with probability `3`/9 (from `4` and `7`)\\n* `1` with probability `3`/9 (from `5` and `8`)\\n* `2` with probability `3`/9 (from `6`)\\n\\nNow you know how to generate `rand3` using `rand2` by calling it exactly 3 times!\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd let\\'s define a **mapping matrix** for this case:\\n```\\n1 1 0\\n1 0 1\\n0 1 1\\n```\\n\\nProperties\\n* Count of ones in each row represent source random degree. \\n\\t* In this case it\\'s 2.\\n* Count of zeros represent target random degree minus source random degree. \\n\\t* In this case it\\'s 3-2 = 1.\\n* Each line is a permutation of string got from the previous two items. \\n\\t* In this case it\\'s `110`.\\n* If we sum numbers in each column, we will get the same numbers, which means that each number has the same probability to occur.\\n\\t* In this case sum equals 2.\\n* We can use this matrix to map smartly map numbers from source random generator.\\n\\t* In our case it was:\\n\\t\\t* `rand2` \\u2192 `{1, 2}` = `a`\\n\\t\\t* `rand2` \\u2192 `{1, 3}` = `b`\\n\\t\\t* `rand2` \\u2192 `{2, 3}` = `c`\\n\\n---\\n\\nNow, image if we want to generate `rand5` using `rand3`, we will get this mapping matrix:\\n```\\n00111\\n01011\\n01101\\n01110\\n10011\\n10101\\n10110\\n11001\\n11010\\n11100\\n```\\n\\nWhich are just all permutations of `00111`.\\n\\nIf you sum numbers in each column, you will get 6, which means that every number has the same probability to occur in the target sum.\\n\\nAnd by this, you can get `rand5` from `rand7` by calling it 10 times.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd the general formula is:\\n\\nIf we want to generate `randN` from `randK` where `K` < `N`, we will call `randK` exactly `N choose K` times( `N!/(K!*(N-K)!)`) ([combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination)).\\n\\nWhich is equal to `N` when `N = K+1`, but getting worse when `K` approaches `N/2`.\\n\\nIn our original task, it will be equal to `10 choose 7 = 120`.

In a setting where you can run scripts, you can scan for favorable numbers by looking through this list:\\n\\n```\\nfor i in range(1000):\\n  result = 7**i\\n  if str(result).startswith(\\'100\\'):\\n\\t  print(i, result, len(str(result))) # print power, number, and the number of base 10 digits\\n```\\n\\nWe see some output:\\n\\n```510, <big number starting with 10000009>, 432```\\n\\nWhich means:\\n\\n```7**510 ~= 1.0000009*10**431```\\n\\nSo, when we call ```rand7``` 510 times, we get a uniform range ```[0, 7**510-1]``` which is ```[0, 1.0000009*10**431]```\\n\\nWhenever the result is within our designed range, we win! We got 431 ```rand10``` numbers that we can cache.\\n\\nWhenever the result is greater than or equal to ```10**431```, we throw it away and call ```rand7``` another 510 times. This is expensive, but it should happen very rarely since we chose the number of ```rand7``` calls optimally `P=0.0000009/1.0000009 ~= 1 out of 100,000 times`\\n\\nThis way, we have an efficiency of ```1.18``` ```(510/431)```, because we get 431 ```rand10()``` calls for every 510 ```rand7()``` calls.\\n\\nThe wastage is negligible because the top range is so small.\\n\\n```\\ntotal calls (510k/431)\\nk = 1 + 0.0000009^1 + 0.0000009^2 + ...\\n0.0000009k = 0.0000009^1 + 0.0000009^2 + 0.0000009^3 + ...\\n0.9999991k = 1\\nk = 1/0.9999991 ~= 1.0000009\\n510k/431 = 1.0000009*510/431 ~= 1.18\\n```\\n\\nHere\\'s the code in Python:\\n```\\nclass Entropy:\\n\\tdef __init__(self):\\n\\t\\tself._store = []\\n\\t\\n\\tdef get(self):\\n\\t\\twhile not len(self._store):\\n\\t\\t\\tself._generate()\\n\\t\\treturn self._store.pop()\\n\\t\\n\\tdef _generate(self):\\n\\t\\tresult = sum([(rand7()-1)*(7**i) for i in range(510)])\\n\\t\\tif result >= 10**431:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(431):\\n\\t\\t\\tself._store.append(1+(result % 10))\\n\\t\\t\\tresult //= 10\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nclass Solution:\\n\\tdef __init__(self):\\n\\t\\tself._entropy = Entropy()\\n\\t\\n\\tdef rand10(self):\\n\\t\\treturn self._entropy.get()\\n```",

(Simple magnification and translation)\\n\\nwe just need an additional randomness of `{+1,+2}`  in this set which we can get from `+rand2()`\\n\\nThus, `rand10() = 2*( rand5() - 1) + rand2()`\\nin other words: `rand({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}) = rand({0,2,4,6,8}) + rand({1,2})`\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\ndef rand10(self):\\n        \\n\\tdef randn(n):\\n\\t\\twhile True:\\n\\t\\t\\tans = rand7()\\n\\t\\t\\tif ans<=n:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn ans\\n\\n\\treturn 2*(randn(5)-1) + randn(2)\\n```\\n\\nFurther optimization: You can notice that rand2() will be slower than rand5(). We can make rand2() faster by implementing rand2() from rand6(), which is faster as it is close to 7.\\n\\nrand2() = (rand6()+2)//3",

Since each bit correspoding to each power of 7 will be randomly generated therefore we can always trust that generated number will be truly random.\\n\\n### Step #2: Realize that we can generate a random number between 0-2400\\nWe know:\\n`0 = 0 [ 0*(7^0)+0*(7^1)+0*(7^2)+0*(7^3)]`\\n`2400 = 6*(7^0)+6*(7^1)+6*(7^2)+6*(7^3)`\\n\\nSince `2400 = 6*(7^0)+6*(7^1)+6*(7^2)+6*(7^3)`, we can try to randomly generate a base-7 number between 0 to 2400. In order to do so, we just have to generate a random number (0-6) 4 times, corresponding to each exponential power of 7.  Therefore:\\n\\n`rand_0_to_2400() = (7**0)*(rand7()-1)+(7**1)*(rand7()-1)+(7**2)*(rand7()-1)+(7**3)*(rand7()-1)`\\n\\n### Step #3: Convert the Random Number between 0-2400 to a random number between 0-10\\nNow since we have a random number between 0 - 2400 where each number is equally likely to occur. We can argue that last digit of this generated number is equally likely to be 0-9.

                "content": "In problems like this, **there\\'s no single correct solution**. That\\'s why the solutions posted differ so much.\\nHowever, the task is not to implement *the best possible* random number generator. The task is to create a *valid* one.\\n\\nThe only criterion of validity is the uniform distribution of generated values, meaning that each value from range `[1, 10]` has an equal probability of being returned.\\n\\nNow, we are provided with a function `rand7()` that is guaranteed to have a uniform distribution, so its return values from the range `[1, 7]` satisfy the equal probability condition.\\n\\nBelow is a sample solution. Remember, there are other valid solutions, some may be more optimal, but this one is easy to analyse:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def rand10(self) -> int:        \\n        while (offset := rand7()) > 5:\\n            offset = rand7()        \\n        \\n        while (segment := rand7()) == 4:\\n            segment = rand7()\\n        \\n        return 5 * (segment > 4) + offset\\n```\\nThe logic is simple: we split the range `[1, 10]` in two segments, `[1, 5]` and `[6, 10]`, then we use `rand7()` to pick one of these segments and to generate an offset within it to determine the final return value.\\n\\nFirst we call `rand7()` to generate a number between `1` and `5`. If the generator returns such a value, we just use it as an offset. Indeed, since the probability of picking any number from `[1, 5]` is the same, the distribution for the offset value is uniform.\\nThe tricky part is when `rand7()` returns either `6` or `7`. In this case *we just roll the dice again*, and keep doing it until we finally hit a number from `[1, 5]`. Since every time we call `rand7()` it picks a value randomly, there\\'s no deterministic answer to when a number from `[1, 5]` will be returned, but what\\'s important is that *the probability of each outcome is the same*.\\n\\nNow we do the same for picking one of two segments. This time we use `4` as a pivot, picking the lower segment for any value smaller than `4`, the higher one for any value greater than `4`, and rolling the dice again when it was exactly `4`. The same rules apply, since numbers from `[1, 3]` have the same probability of being picked as numbers from `[5, 7]`, the overall distribution is uniform.\\n\\nThe final step is combining two independently generated uniformly distributed random values, which is again a random number with uniform distribution. And that\\'s exactly what we needed! =)\\n\\nPlease upvote this post if you found it useful \\uD83D\\uDE04",

                "content": "**PREAMBLE**\\n\\nGiven rand7( ), the function alone is not enough to provide a fine-grained enough variation of integer results to directly create rand10( ). That is, if we did\\n```\\n\\tconst rand10 = () => 10*Math.round(rand7()/7);\\n```\\nthe scope of possible results taking [10*(1/7), 10*(2/7)..., 10*(7/7)] would be limited to [1,3,4,6,7,9,10], i.e. it\\'s impossible to get the numbers  [2,5,8]. If the problem was to go from some function with more fine-grained set of possibilities to a smaller one (like creating rand7( ) from rand10( )) then the above approach would potentially be viable:\\n```\\n\\tconst rand7 = () => 7*Math.round(rand10/10);\\n```\\nas it creates the results [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6,6,7] -- all required possible outcomes 1-7 are reachable but the probability is still not totally even as it should be (some numbers occur with 2/10 frequency while others occur with 1/10 frequency) and this distribution would be exposed for large numbers of tries of rand7( ).\\n\\n**THIS PROBLEM\\'S SOLUTIONS**\\n\\nThe key is to use multiple calls of rand7( ) to generate a large enough range of numbers that can be reduced down to the integers ranging from 1 - 10 inclusive with fairly even probability consistently. This means calls of rand7( ) must be increased in such a way that the result \"gaps\" noticed before are somehow overcome without skewing the distribution unfairly.\\n\\nOne approach is to sum rand7( ) calls and combine with modulo 10, creating a larger and larger possible range of rand7( ) sums between some lower and some upper bound until the breadth and variation in possible sums produced (in combination with modulo) satisfies all the test cases like so:\\n```\\n const rand10 = () => (rand7() + rand7() + ..... + rand7()) % 10 + 1;\\n const rand10 = () => (rand7() + rand7() + rand7() + rand7() + rand7()) % 10 + 1;   //final answer from trial and error\\n```\\nwhere rand7( )\\'s are added until the submit passes. By trial and error, a minimum of five calls to rand7( ) appear to be required to pass. \\n\\nAs others have pointed out, this appears to be because this is the threshold at which the probability distribution for (7 sided die)^5 producing sums 5 to 35 (see Wolfram: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=7+sided+die+rolled+5+times+distribution ), has been divided roughly equally after the modulo 10 which groups the probabilities by their last digit.\\n\\nEach outcome from 1 to 10 for rand10( ) gets three slices of the probability distribution (sums) above, spaced roughly evenly: from a cursory visual inspection you can see that P(5) + P(15) + P(25) is about equal to P(6)+P(16)+P(26) and so on. The even spacing of each last digit group in the distribution compensates for variations in adjacent values between one digit group and the next.\\n\\nLower numbers of dice do not work because they create distributions that are not as finely divided into different sums and can not be as evenly distributed to the 10 answers. When the discrepancies are pronounced to some arbitrary extent, the runs fail.\\n\\nThe five rand7( ) calls create the minimum necessary refinement of the range of answers. Additional rand7( ) calls would further refine the range of answers beyond the requirement and still pass but represent an unnecessary expenditure of speed and memory.\\n\\nAnother approach is to square two rand7( ) calls and calculate an answer like so:\\n\\n```\\nconst rand10 = () => {\\n    let random = 41;\\n    while (random > 40) random = 7 * (rand7() - 1) + rand7();\\n    return (random % 10) + 1; \\n};\\n```\\nthe range of possible square results, before the modulo 10 step, is 1 to 49. The largest full multiple of 10 within this range is 40 and is used as a bound for rejecting samples. \\n\\nIncluding samples ranging from 41 to 49 would unfairly add outcomes for rand10 => 2 to 10 to the answer pool, so the answer is only taken when the squared value is <= 40 to maintain even probability for rand10 => 1 to 10.",

Then find another number `b` which is not `7`, being one of `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, so that it has a fair chance of being even or odd. Consequently we can get a `0` or `1` out of `b` by taking its modulus of 2. Finally, subtraction of `a` and `b%2` yields an integer with in the range `[1, 10]`. The generations of `a` and `b` are independent, so the probability of each combination is `0.2*0.5=0.1`. Thus we have a uniform distribution.\\n\\nThe crux to this problem is `UNIFORM`. The most simplistic way to guarantee that is to make sure there is one and only one way to generate a specific number. So that\\'s what I did. First, you need a range `at least` as long as 10.   \\n\\nThat\\'s easy, a multiplication by 2 will do. Then you realize not all numbers in this range are accessible: 3, 9 .etc.  \\n\\nHow do we fix that ? We try to shift the result by at most 1. And that\\'s what `b` is for.  \\n\\nBy `at least`, I mean there are other ways. Like if we multiply the range by 3, it works too. The important thing here is to make sure no overlapping happens.",

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nMapping rand7 with rand10.\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nSince rand10 can produce numbers from [1 to 10] and rand7 can produce numbers from [1 to 7] we cannot map rand7 to rand10 directly because it is not possible to map smaller group [1 to 7] with a bigger group [1 to 10]. To achieve a uniform distribution of numbers between 1 and 10 using rand7(), we need to use two instances of rand7() to generate a range of numbers greater than 10. This ensures that all numbers between 1 and 10 have an equal probability of being generated.\\n\\n# Explanation\\n1. Generate two random numbers x and y using rand7().\\n\\n2. Calculate the position in a 2D matrix of size 7x7 using the formula pos = (x - 1) * 7 + y.\\n\\n3. If the generated position pos is greater than 40, we have 9 extra possibilities (41 to 49) that we don\\'t need. These extra possibilities do not have equal probability of being generated, so reject them by making a recursive call to rand10(). This ensures that we only have 40 possibilities (1 to 40) with equal probability.\\n\\n4. To get a number between 1 and 10, take the modulus of (pos - 1) with 10 and add 1. This step ensures that all numbers between 1 and 10 have an equal probability of being generated.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(1)\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(1)\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution extends SolBase {\\n    public int rand10() {\\n        int x = rand7();\\n        int y = rand7();\\n        int pos = (x-1)*7+y;\\n        if(pos>40) return rand10();\\n        return (pos-1)%10+1;\\n    }\\n}\\n/**\\n    0  1  2  3  4  5  6\\n    11 12 13 14 15 16 17\\n\\n    7  8  9  0  1  2  3\\n    21 22 23 24 25 26 27\\n\\n    4  5  6  7  8  9  0\\n    31 32 33 34 35 36 37\\n\\n    1  2  3  4  5  6  7\\n    41 42 43 44 45 46 47\\n\\n    8  9  0  1  2  3  4 \\n    51 52 53 54 55 56 57\\n\\n    5  6  7  8  9  0  1\\n    61 62 63 64 65 66 67\\n\\n    2  3  4  5  6  7  8\\n    71 72 73 74 75 76 77\\n */\\n```",

For that, you want to do the `/7*10` *after* adding rand7() + Math.random(); so you need some parentheses.   `let x = (rand7() - 1 + Math.random)*10/7;` Then you can return `1 + Math.min(10, Math.trunc( x))` or something (or stick with your recursive call.)\\nThat should pass the tests, but still violates one of the provisions  of the problem statement."

The reason the two dice thing doesnt work is because there are more combos that add up to 7 than those that add up to 2 or 12. You cant extend the same argument here, as the only way to 2.35 is by adding 2 and .35.

We need to identify the managers based on their role and count the number of employees who report to them.\\n\\n# Approach\\nTo solve the problem, your approach can be explained as follows:\\n\\n1. First, we group the employees based on the managers they report to. This helps us identify the managers and their direct reports.\\n1. Then, we filter the groups and keep only those where the count of employees reporting to the manager is at least five. This ensures we select only the managers who have at least five direct reports.\\n1. Finally, we retrieve the names of the employees who are identified as qualifying managers based on the filtered results.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time complexity of your solution depends on the number of rows in the Employee table. The subquery groups the employees, and the outer query performs the filtering and retrieval. The time complexity can be expressed as $$O(n)$$, where n is the number of employees in the table.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity of your solution depends on the size of the result set. In this case, it will be the number of managers who have at least five direct reports.

Then, we can use a **GROUP BY** clause to group the results by manager name and use a **HAVING** clause to filter out the managers who have less than five direct reports.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Join the Employee table with itself on the condition that `e1.id = e2.managerId`. This will give us all pairs of managers and their direct reports.\\n2. Group the results by manager name using a `GROUP BY` clause.\\n3. Use a `HAVING` clause to filter out the managers who have less than five direct reports.\\n4. Select the manager name column to get the final result.\\n\\nHere is the SQL code that implements this approach:\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT e1.name\\nFROM Employee e1\\nJOIN Employee e2\\nON e1.id = e2.managerId\\nGROUP BY e1.name\\nHAVING COUNT(e2.id) >= 5;\\n",

It retrieves the name and id of each employee along with a count of how many times their name appears in the joined result, which essentially represents the number of subordinates they have.\\n3. The GROUP BY clause groups the result by the name and id of the manager (employee), which is essential for counting the number of subordinates for each manager.\\n4. The WHERE clause filters the results from the subquery to only include those rows where the count of subordinates (countname) is greater than 4\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n# Write your MySQL query statement below\\nselect c.name from (select a.name, count(a.name) countname\\nfrom Employee as a left join Employee as b\\non a.id=b.managerid\\ngroup by a.name,a.id) as c where c.countname>4;\\n\\n```",

In the subquery, we count the number of employees managed by each employee (represented by e1) by matching their id with the managerId of other employees (represented by e2). We then filter for employees (e1) who have at least five direct reports (i.e., where the count is greater than or equal to 5). This gives us the names of managers with the specified criteria.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time complexity of this SQL query depends on the size of the Employee table. It involves a correlated subquery that scans the Employee table for each employee (e1), resulting in a complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of rows in the table.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity is primarily determined by the database\\'s internal handling of the query and result set.

                "content": "# Approach\\nThe given code is a Java implementation of a solution to find the second minimum value in a binary tree. Let\\'s break down the approach step by step:\\n\\n1. The `findSecondMinimumValue` method takes a `TreeNode` object called `root` as input and returns an integer.\\n\\n2. Inside the method, a `HashSet` called `hs` is created to store unique values encountered during the tree traversal.\\n\\n3. The `find` method is called to perform an in-order traversal of the binary tree. It takes the `root` node and the `hs` set as parameters.\\n\\n4. The `find` method is a recursive function that performs an in-order traversal of the binary tree. It visits the left subtree first, then adds the value of the current node to the `hs` set, and finally visits the right subtree.\\n\\n5. After the traversal is complete, the `hs` set will contain all unique values from the binary tree.\\n\\n6. An integer variable `k` is initialized to 0, and an integer array `ans` of size `hs.size()` is created to store the values from the `hs` set.\\n\\n7. A for-each loop iterates over the elements of the `hs` set and assigns them to the `ans` array.\\n\\n8. The `ans` array is sorted in ascending order using the `Arrays.sort` method.\\n\\n9. If the length of the `ans` array is 1, it means there is only one unique value in the binary tree. In this case, -1 is returned as there is no second minimum value.\\n\\n10. Otherwise, the second element (index 1) of the sorted `ans` array is returned as the second minimum value.\\n\\nIn summary, the code performs an in-order traversal of a binary tree, collects all unique values in a `HashSet`, and then finds the second minimum value from the collected values.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- **Time complexity**:\\nThe time complexity of the code is O(n + m log m), where n is the number of nodes in the tree and m is the number of unique values in the tree.\\n\\n- **Space complexity**:\\nThe space complexity of the code is O(n + m) in the average case and O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes in the tree and m is the number of unique values.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int findSecondMinimumValue(TreeNode root) {\\n        Set<Integer>hs=new HashSet();\\n        find(root,hs);\\n        int k=0;\\n        int[] ans=new int[hs.size()];\\n        for(var i:hs){\\n            ans[k++]=i;\\n        }\\n        Arrays.sort(ans);\\n        if(ans.length==1)return -1;   \\n         return ans[1];\\n    }\\n    static void find(TreeNode root,Set<Integer>hs){\\n        if(root==null)return;\\n        find(root.left,hs);\\n        hs.add(root.val);\\n        find(root.right,hs);\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Initialize a variable `min_` with a large value (`2**32`) and a stack with the `root` node.\\n2. Start a loop that continues until the `stack` is empty.\\n3. Inside the loop, `pop` a node from the `stack`.\\n4. Compare the value of the current node with the value of the `root` node.\\n    - If they are different, update `min_` with the smaller of the current `node\\'s value` and `min_`.\\n5. If the current node has a `left` child, push the `left` child onto the `stack`.\\n6. If the current node has a `right` child, push the `right` child onto the `stack`.\\n7. After processing all nodes, return `-1` if `min_` was not updated, otherwise return the value of `min_`.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- ### Time Complexity: $O(N)$\\nThe time complexity of the code is determined by the traversal of all nodes in the binary tree. In the worst case, the code visits every node exactly once. Therefore, the time complexity is $O(N)$, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.\\n\\n- ### Space Complexity: $O(N)$\\nThe space complexity of the code is determined by the space required to store the `stack` for the depth-first traversal. In the worst case, the `stack` can hold all nodes in a branch of the binary tree, which corresponds to the height of the tree.\\n\\nIn a balanced binary tree, the height is approximately $log\\u2082(N)$, where` N` is the number of nodes. In the worst case, when the tree is completely unbalanced (essentially a linked list), the height becomes `N`.\\n\\n*Therefore, the space complexity can vary:*\\n\\n`Balanced Binary Tree`: $O(log N)$\\n`Unbalanced Binary Tree`: $O(N)$\\n\\nThe `min_` variable, regardless of the value it holds, takes constant space as it\\'s a single integer variable.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the code has a time complexity of $O(N)$ and a space complexity that depends on the height of the binary tree, varying between $O(log N)$ for balanced trees and $O(N)$ for completely unbalanced trees.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def findSecondMinimumValue(self, root):\\n        min_ = 2**32\\n        stack = [root]\\n        while stack:\\n            node = stack.pop()\\n            if node.val != root.val:\\n                min_ = min(min_,node.val)\\n            if node.left:\\n                stack.append(node.left)\\n            if node.right:\\n                stack.append(node.right)\\n        return -1 if min_ == 2**32 else min_\\n        \\n```",

The algorithm defines a recursive function called \"rec\" that takes three parameters: a TreeNode pointer \"root\" representing the current node being processed, an integer reference \"mini\" representing the minimum value found so far in the tree, and a long long reference \"ans\" representing the current second minimum value found so far.\\n\\n2. If the current node \"root\" is null (i.e., there is no node), the function returns and exits.\\n\\n3. If the value of the current node \"root\" is not equal to the minimum value \"mini\" and is less than the current second minimum value \"ans\", it means we have found a new potential second minimum value. In this case, we update \"ans\" with the value of the current node.\\n\\n4. The algorithm then recursively calls the \"rec\" function on the left child of the current node, passing the same minimum value \"mini\" and the updated second minimum value \"ans\".\\n\\n5. Similarly, the algorithm recursively calls the \"rec\" function on the right child of the current node, passing the same minimum value \"mini\" and the updated second minimum value \"ans\".\\n\\n6.

Similarly, the algorithm recursively calls the \"rec\" function on the right child of the current node, passing the same minimum value \"mini\" and the updated second minimum value \"ans\".\\n\\n6. The main function \"findSecondMinimumValue\" initializes the \"ans\" variable with the maximum value possible for a long long type (LONG_MAX). This is done to ensure that if a second minimum value is not found in the tree, the \"ans\" variable remains unchanged.\\n\\n7. The \"rec\" function is called with the root of the tree, the value of the root node as the initial minimum value, and the \"ans\" variable as the initial second minimum value.\\n\\n8. Finally, the function returns the second minimum value found (if it exists) by checking if \"ans\" has been updated (i.e., it is not equal to LONG_MAX).

We are given two strings: jewels, representing the types of jewels, and stones, representing the stones we have. We need to determine how many stones in our collection match the jewel types.\\n\\n\\n# Approach\\nTo solve the problem, your approach can be explained as follows:\\n\\n1. We start with a counter variable called count to keep track of the number of jewels found.\\n1. We look at each stone in our collection, one by one.\\n1. For each stone, we check if it matches any of the jewel types by looking at the jewels string.\\n1. If we find a match, it means the stone is a jewel, so we increment the count variable.\\n1. After checking all the stones, we return the final value of the count variable, which represents the total number of stones that are also jewels.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time it takes to execute your solution depends on the number of stones and jewels we have. We need to compare each stone with each jewel to determine if there is a match. So, the time complexity can be thought of as $$O(n * m)$$, where n is the number of stones and m is the number of jewel types.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space required by your solution is minimal. It does not depend on the input size because you only use a constant amount of extra space. So, the space complexity can be considered as $$O(1)$$.\\n# Code\\n```java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {\\n        int count = 0;\\n        \\n        // Iterate through each stone in the stones string\\n        for (int i = 0; i < stones.length(); i++) {\\n            char ch = stones.charAt(i);\\n            \\n            // Check if the stone is a jewel by searching for it in the jewels string\\n            if (jewels.contains(String.valueOf(ch))) {\\n                count++; // Increment the count if the stone is a jewel\\n            }        \\n        }\\n        \\n        return count; // Return the final count of jewels found in the stones\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n```python []\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels, stones):\\n        count = 0\\n        \\n        # Iterate through each stone\\n        for ch in stones:\\n            \\n            # Check if the stone is a jewel\\n            if ch in jewels:\\n                count += 1\\n        \\n        return count\\n\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {\\n        int count = 0;\\n        \\n        // Iterate through each stone in the stones string\\n        for (char ch : stones) {\\n            \\n            // Check if the stone is a jewel by searching for it in the jewels string\\n            if (jewels.find(ch) != string::npos) {\\n                count++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return count;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```\\n",

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe given code is a JavaScript function named numJewelsInStones, which takes two arguments, jewels and stones. The function is designed to count the number of occurrences of characters in jewels in the string stones. The function uses a loop to iterate over each character in jewels and creates a regular expression object using the new RegExp() method. The function then checks if the regular expression matches any characters in stones using the match() method, and if there are matches, it increments the res variable by the number of matches.\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe function uses a simple approach of iterating over the jewels string and creating a regular expression object using the new RegExp() method with the g flag to match all occurrences of the character in stones. It then uses the match() method to check if the regular expression matches any characters in stones and increments the res variable by the number of matches. Finally, the function returns the res variable, which contains the count of all occurrences of characters in jewels in the string stones.\\n# Complexity\\n<!-- - Time complexity: -->\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n<!-- - Space complexity: -->\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe time complexity of the given code is O(nm), where n and m are the lengths of the jewels and stones strings, respectively. This is because the function iterates over each character in jewels and creates a regular expression object using the new RegExp() method. The regular expression object is then used with the match() method, which searches the entire stones string for matches. Therefore, the time complexity of the match() method is O(m). Since this operation is performed for each character in jewels, the total time complexity of the function is O(nm). The space complexity of the function is O(1), as it only uses a single variable res to store the count of matches and a regular expression object.\\n# Code\\n```\\n/**\\n * @param {string} jewels\\n * @param {string} stones\\n * @return {number}\\n */\\nvar numJewelsInStones = function (jewels, stones) {\\n  let res = 0;\\n\\n  for (let index = 0; index < jewels.length; index++) {\\n    let re = new RegExp(jewels[index], \"g\");\\n    if (stones.match(re) != null) res += stones.match(re).length;\\n  }\\n\\n  return res;\\n};\\n\\n```",
