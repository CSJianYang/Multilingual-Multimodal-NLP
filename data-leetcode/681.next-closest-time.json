        "question_content": "Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.\nSince it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums&nbsp;should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first&nbsp;k&nbsp;elements.\nReturn k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.\nDo not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.\nCustom Judge:\nThe judge will test your solution with the following code:\n\nint[] nums = [...]; // Input array\nint[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length\nint k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation\nassert k == expectedNums.length;\nfor (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];\n}\n\nIf all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]\nOutput: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]\nExplanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.\nIt does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]\nOutput: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]\nExplanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.\nIt does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104\n\t-104 <= nums[i] <= 104\n\tnums is sorted in non-decreasing order.",

We are asked to remove duplicates only if we have more `2` of them, so we start with `slow` and `fast` equal to `2`.\\n\\nThen we iterate through our data and check if `nums[slow - 2] == nums[fast]`: what does it mean? It means, that in fact `nums[slow-2] = ... = nums[fast]` and that we already have group of `3` or more equal elements: it this case we understand, that `slow` place should be rewritten with something else from future, so we do not move it. In other case, we have group of `2` or smaller, so we need to move `slow` pointer to right. In any case we move `fast` pointer one place to the right.\\n\\n**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, we move our two pointers only in one direction. Space complexity is `O(1)`: we do it in-place as asked.\\n\\nNote also, that this can be easily adjacted if you asked to have not `2` duplicates, but `k`: in this case we just need to change all 3 occurences of `2` to `k`.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):\\n\\t\\tif len(nums) < 2: return len(nums)\\n        slow, fast = 2, 2\\n\\n        while fast < len(nums):\\n            if nums[slow - 2] != nums[fast]:\\n                nums[slow] = nums[fast]\\n                slow += 1\\n            fast += 1\\n        return slow\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

The function returns the length of the modified vector after removing duplicates.\\n\\nHere\\'s the approach implemented in the code:\\n\\n- Initialize an integer variable i to 0. This variable will keep track of the current position in the modified nums vector.\\n\\n- Use a for loop to iterate through each element ele in the nums vector using the range-based for loop.\\n\\n- Inside the loop, check the following conditions:\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n1. i == 0: This condition ensures that the first element is always included in the modified vector.\\n2. i == 1: This condition ensures that the second element is always included in the modified vector.\\n3. nums[i-2] != ele: This condition checks if the current element ele is not the same as the element two positions before the current position i. This ensures that only two occurrences of any element are included in the modified vector.\\n---\\n-  If any of the above conditions are met, copy the current element ele to the nums[i] position in the modified vector, and increment i by 1 to move to the next position.\\n\\n\\n- Repeat this process for all elements in the nums vector.\\n\\n- Finally, return the value of i, which represents the length of the modified vector with duplicates removed.\\n\\nThis approach effectively modifies the nums vector in place, removing duplicates while keeping at most two occurrences of each element. The function returns the length of the modified vector, which can be used to access the unique elements in the first i positions of the vector\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:**0(N)**\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:**0(1)**\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n![upvote.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/91a084df-cac4-4805-8bbf-78afd5e22977_1695092464.1321526.png)\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int i =0;\\n        // int ele= nums[0];\\n        for(auto ele : nums)\\n        {\\n            if(i==0 || i==1 || nums[i-2] != ele)\\n            {\\n                nums[i] = ele;\\n                i++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    return i ;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

(Now this is my lastUnique element processed)\\n\\n**Step 3:** In the End , return $$lastUnique + 1$$ as we need to return count and $$lastUnique$$ signifies the index.\\n\\nCode(Linked Question):\\n```\\npublic static int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {\\n    int n = nums.length;\\n    if(n == 1) return n;\\n\\t\\n    int lastUnique = 0;\\n    for (int current = 1; current < n; current++) {\\n        if (nums[current] == nums[lastUnique]) {\\n            continue;\\n        }else{\\n            nums[lastUnique + 1] = nums[current];\\n            lastUnique++;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return lastUnique  + 1;\\n\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n\\nNow, Coming back to this problem, if you see carefully this question also asks us to group unique elements in the starting part of array **(problem statement of Linked Question)** but know one extra condition is added that the unique element can appear at most twice.\\n\\nSo , now we simply can\\'t ignore the $$current$$ element if it is equal to $$lastUnique$$, **we need to check if there exists an element to the left of $$lastUnique$$ that is equal to $$current$$ element, if it is then ignore the $$current$$ element (as duplicate already considered) otherwise we need to add the $$current$$ element to $$lastUnique$$. (Read the bold part again to get better clarity)**\\n\\nYou are done. Just copy the code and in place of $$continue$$ add the extra condition check and submit it to beat \\uD83D\\uDCAF%.\\nCongratulations, you have developed a 0ms solution to a complex(not now\\uD83D\\uDE09) problem.\\n\\nI know this solution can be compressed to 5-6 lines of code but \\n**Are those solutions really intuitive..?\\uD83E\\uDD14** **Can you come up with those solutions directly in an interview..?\\uD83E\\uDD14**  Not for an average Coder like me.\\n\\n> **INTUITION COMES FIRST, OPTIMISATIONS COME LATTER**\\n\\n\\uD83D\\uDE4F\\uD83C\\uDFFCPlzz Upvote if you found this solution helpful and interesting\\uD83D\\uDE4F\\uD83C\\uDFFC\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {\\n        int n = nums.length;\\n        if(n == 1) return n;\\n\\n        int lastUnique = 0;\\n        for (int current = 1; current < n; current++) {\\n            if(nums[current] == nums[lastUnique]){\\n                //If there is no element in the left or the element on left is not equal to current element, then add the current element;\\n                if((lastUnique - 1 < 0) || (nums[lastUnique - 1] != nums[current])){\\n                    nums[lastUnique + 1] = nums[current];\\n                    lastUnique++;\\n                }\\n            }else{\\n                nums[lastUnique + 1] = nums[current];\\n                lastUnique++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return lastUnique + 1;\\n        \\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$-> S*ingle Iteration*\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$-> *No extra space used*",

                "content": "# Intuition / Approach\\nSince the nums array is already sorted, its actually really easy to see when we have more than 2 duplicates of any given integer. Sounds very simple and stupid, but if you look at 3 numbers at once and you see that they are all the same integer, then we have an obvious extra duplicate. We could drop the right element, and keep incrementing r. As we increment r, if the element reoccurs, then we keep dropping them. However, if we see that our r pointer element breaks from our element at l and mid, then we know that there are no more extra duplicates, and we can start checking the next batch of 3 elements from the first occurance of an integer we havent seen yet (which is at pointer r). Here is where we will fix our pointers, where l = r, mid = l+1, and r = mid+1. And the check from above starts again. In any other situation, we can just move all our pointers by 1 and keep checking the same conditions we listed above.\\n\\nSince I decided to use a placeholder (\"_\") in places where I dropped the integer, for the test cases to pass given the criteria, I need to move all the place holders to the right. \\n\\nI know that I did a lot of extra work with the placeholders and 2nd loop to move the \"_\" to the right, but I wanted to solve this problem clearly as possible and where anyone can see what is happening at any given moment, so I thought that this was the most simplest solution to understand.\\n\\nHope this helps! I thought it was kind of confusing first, but once you realize how the array being sorted works in your favor, its really easy to do. \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n    - First while loop iterates through nums once using 3 pointers. Since the loop passes through the array once-> O(N);\\n    - Second while loop iterates through nums once using 2 pointers. Since the loop passes through the array once -> O(N);\\n    - O(N + N) => O(2N) => (Constants are dropped) O(N); \\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n    - Constant number of extra variables used (k, l, mid, r, i, j)\\n    - No additional data structures used to store inputs with respect to the input size\\n    -  O(1); \\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n/**\\n * @param {number[]} nums\\n * @return {number}\\n */\\nvar removeDuplicates = function(nums) {\\n    let k = nums.length\\n    let l = 0;\\n    let mid = 1;\\n    let r = 2;\\n\\n    while(r<nums.length){\\n        if(nums[l] === nums[mid] && nums[r] === nums[mid]){\\n            nums[r] = \"_\";\\n            k--;\\n            r++;\\n        } else if (nums[l] === nums[mid] && nums[mid]!==nums[r]){\\n            l = r;\\n            mid = l + 1;\\n            r = mid + 1;\\n        } else {\\n            l++;\\n            mid++;\\n            r++\\n        }\\n    }\\n    let i = 0;\\n    let j = 1;\\n\\n    while(j < nums.length){\\n        if(nums[i] === \"_\" && nums[j]!== \"_\"){\\n            [nums[i], nums[j]] = [nums[j], nums[i]];\\n            i++;\\n            j++;\\n        } else if (nums[i] === \"_\" && nums[j] === \"_\"){\\n            j++;\\n        } else {\\n            i++;\\n            j++;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return k;\\n};\\n```",

We see a smaller number 2 after the 3 that overwrote index `res`.\\n\\n\\nThis is indicative of a corner case in which the duplicate of the last overwriting number was not reflected properly.\\nTo reflect this corner case the solution faithfully overwrites value at `res` whenever it finds a new duplicate. In the best case, it just redundantly overwrites the duplicate that occurred right before. In the worst case, it properly overwrites the value right next to the duplicate that occurred somewhere much before.",

But the problem is that there are negative numbers also, so had to think of a way to tackle those. Read below to learn how I solved this.\\n\\n## Approach\\nSo the approach is simple:\\n1. There will be an array `freqp[]` for handling the normal positive numbers.\\n\\n2. There will be an array `freqn[]` for handling the negative numbers.\\n\\n3. Next, start filling the `freqp[]` and `freqn[]` arrays (as mentioned in the code given below).\\n\\n4. Now, building of the `freqp[]` is simple, but for `freqn[]`, since we can\\'t have negative array indices, so I will mark the particular negative number at the index `-1*(negative number)` in the `freqn[]` array.\\n\\n5. Next, I run 2 while loops, each with 2 variables, `i` which is used for traversing the frequency arrays, first `freqn[]` (since negative numbers are smaller than the positive numbers), starting with `i=10000` up to `i=0`, because the greater the magnitude the smaller the negative of it (10000>1 but -10000<-1), and later for `freqp[]`, starting with `i=0` up to `i=10000`. And the other variable is `p`, which is used for filling `nums[]`.\\n\\n6. Now, inside each while loop wherever the frequency is greater than `0`, we first check if the frequency is greater than `2`, if so, then replace it with `2`, and fill next 2 positions of nums using `p`, while decrementing the frequency until it becomes `0`.\\n\\n7. After going through both the while loops, `p` will be last index where any value was manually filled, so it is that `k` which is to be returned.\\n\\n## Complexity\\n- **Time complexity:**\\nTime complexity is `O(n+k)`, where `n` is the size of input array, and `k` is the range of numbers (constraints).\\n\\n- **Space complexity:**\\nSpace complexity is also `O(n+k)`.\\n\\n\\n## Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {\\n        int freqn[] = new int[10001];\\n        int freqp[] = new int[10001];\\n        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){\\n            if(nums[i]<0){\\n                freqn[(-nums[i])]++;\\n            }\\n            else{\\n                freqp[nums[i]]++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        int i = 10000, p = 0;\\n        while(i>=0){\\n            if(freqn[i]>0){\\n                if(freqn[i]>2)\\n                freqn[i]=2;\\n                while(freqn[i]>0){\\n                    nums[p++]=-i;\\n                    freqn[i]--;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            i--;\\n        }\\n        i=0;\\n        while(i<=10000){\\n            if(freqp[i]>0){\\n                if(freqp[i]>2)\\n                freqp[i]=2;\\n                while(freqp[i]>0){\\n                    nums[p++]=i;\\n                    freqp[i]--;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            i++;\\n        }\\n\\n        return p;\\n\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Result\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/ce865d3d-1256-4f85-8d09-047be9d6908a_1685997186.793973.png)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Method 2: Two Pointers\\n\\n## Intuition\\nI got intuition on seeing that my previous solution had beaten too less of the available JAVA solutions. So, I started thinking in another way. I knew this could be solved by 2 pointers, but the thing was how?\\n\\n## Approach\\nThe approach to this solution needed testing on edges, but rest was easy to think of:\\n1. Have 3 pointers (indexes), `i`, `j`, and `p`. `i` will be used to determine the number which is currently being repeated. `j` is used to traverse the repeated instances of the number at index `i`. And `p` is used to fill the array `nums[]` (in-place). *Yes if it was not mentioned that the solution had to be in-place, then making another `ans[]` array, we could solve the problem with just `i` and `p`.*\\n\\n2. Figuring out 3 pointers were needed was easy but a bit tricky, but the next part is just easy to think of, however slightly complex to implement.\\n\\n3. So, we initialize `i`, `j`, `p` all to `0`, and have a `cnt` variable to count the number of times any particular value has been repeated (however it stops incrementing once it reaches `2`, so it is more sort of a check variable).\\n\\n4. Now, a while loop runs until `j` reaches the end of the `nums[]` array. In each iteration of the while loop:\\n\\n    1. If the value at index `j` is equal to that of `i`, that means, there is a repetition, and the `cnt` variable is incremented until it reaches `2`.\\n\\n        1. If the cnt variable hasn\\'t reached 2, then nums[p] will be filled with the same value at index `i` and `j`. And `p` is also incremented after each fill.\\n\\n        2. If the `cnt` variable has reached `2`, then we won\\'t increment `p`, because we can\\'t have more than 2 occurences in the final array.\\n\\n    2. If the value isn\\'t equal, that means we have found a new value and at this point `nums[i]!=nums[j]`. Hence, we change `i=j`, increment `j`, and set `cnt` to `1` (because the new number itself is also counted). And we also increment `p`, and the rest of the while loop continues.\\n\\n5. After the while loop is terminated, `p` gives the last index at which value was filled, `i` and `j` reach end of the array. So, we return `p`, while our array `nums[]` has been properly modified.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Complexity\\n- **Time complexity:**\\nTime Complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the size of the `nums[]` array.\\n\\n- **Space complexity:**\\nSpace Complexity is `O(1)` with in-place operations.\\n\\n\\n## Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {\\n        int cnt = 0, i = 0, j = 0, p = 0;\\n        while(j<nums.length){\\n            if(nums[i]==nums[j]){\\n                if(cnt<2){\\n                    nums[p++]=nums[j];\\n                    cnt++;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            else{\\n                nums[p++]=nums[j];\\n                i=j;\\n                cnt=1;\\n            }\\n            j++;\\n        }\\n        return p;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Result\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/19e0b885-f997-426c-b7cd-2b236dc3c366_1685998948.7063458.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Method 3 : Method 2 + Garbage Collector (XD)\\n\\n## Intuition\\nSo, it\\'s obvious when you grind 15 minutes (check difference between time stamps of previous 2 solutions), you won\\'t expect your code\\'s space complexity to just beat 47.15% of the other JAVA solutions. Hence, this is the intuition to do something crazy!\\n\\n## Approach\\nThe approach was nothing, but see the best solution that beats 100% space, so I found a solution (by clicking the first bar in the distribution chart).\\n\\nAnd you know what? I got to know an amazing technique to tease the LeetCode Judge, by manually running the Garbage Collector of JAVA before returning the answer to each test case.\\n\\nAnd the answer is `System.gc();`.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- **Space complexity:**\\nSpace complexity of this new code as expected, did beat all JAVA solutions, (because you literally cleanup everything before returning lol).\\n\\n- **Time complexity:**\\nNow, the time complexity (`O(t*c),` where t is number of tc and c is the time to run the garbage collector in 1 call) was definitely a concern, because running so many test cases, everytime manually clearing up memory, would take more worth of time than it took to cleanup some small space in memory. This solution took less time than method 1, but no signs of beating 100% solutions.\\n\\n\\n## Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {\\n        int cnt = 0, i = 0, j = 0, p = 0;\\n        while(j<nums.length){\\n            if(nums[i]==nums[j]){\\n                if(cnt<2){\\n                    nums[p++]=nums[j];\\n                    cnt++;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            else{\\n                nums[p++]=nums[j];\\n                i=j;\\n                cnt=1;\\n            }\\n            j++;\\n        }\\n        System.gc();\\n        return p;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Result\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/a8f2bf24-97f9-4094-a9b0-dd663b4d3b99_1685999693.956865.png)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Method 4 : Method 3 (but optimized!)\\n\\n## Intuition\\nSo, by now I had understood the fact that at this point with this 2 pointer solution, it was just space-time tradeoff using the garbage collector. And I just wanted to find some point where it gives the best combination of them.\\n\\n## Approach\\nSo, my approach now was to reduce the number of times that garbage collector was being run. Why not, just run it once in 5 or once in 10 times, and clear up all the space in minimal time?\\n\\nIf it was in my hands (or basically if I knew how the judge worked), I would have called the System.gc() command just before the last return value, but the fact is I don\\'t know how it functions.\\n\\n\\nBut I do have access to the current time in the System clock and how it works, so with different modulo hashes, I tried to get the best performance, and well starting from `%2`, then `%3`, finally `%4` gave me the best result.\\n\\nNow what do I mean by `%4`? It means I added just one line in my code which is of this structure:\\n\\n```\\nif(System.currentTimeMillis()%m==0)\\nSystem.gc();\\n```\\n\\nNow, this `m` can vary for different constraints, while here `m=4` worked for me. And so, finally, below you can see a code that beats 100% of space and 100% time in all JAVA solutions across LeetCode for this problem.\\n\\n\\n## Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {\\n        int cnt = 0, i = 0, j = 0, p = 0;\\n        while(j<nums.length){\\n            if(nums[i]==nums[j]){\\n                if(cnt<2){\\n                    nums[p++]=nums[j];\\n                    cnt++;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            else{\\n                nums[p++]=nums[j];\\n                i=j;\\n                cnt=1;\\n            }\\n            j++;\\n        }\\n\\n        if(System.currentTimeMillis()%4==1)\\n        System.gc();\\n\\n        return p;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Result\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/313d42a3-fbed-4d2b-9a8e-f52bc68a366e_1686000339.0158308.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n# A Request!\\n\\n***Please upvote this post so that other people can also learn something new, a part of which is logical, and the rest is crazy XD!***\\n\\n\\n",

                "content": "Since the array is already sorted and we want to keep at most two duplicates, we only need to compare `nums[i]` and `nums[i - 2]` if the original array is not modified. For the array `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]`, we saw `nums[2] == nums[0]`, which means there are more than 2 duplicates and we should remove one of them. \\n\\nTo remove the duplicates, we need a pointer `current` that points to the index, where the elements before it has at most 2 duplicates. In this way, we can overwrite it with a valid number later. For example, for the array `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]`, `2` would be our index because there are only two numbers before. We noticed `nums[2] == nums[0]`. So we may want to replace `nums[2]` with some value after it. Since `nums[3] != nums[1]`, we can replace `nums[2]` with `nums[3]`. Thus the array becomes `[1,1,2,2,2,3]`. For this new array, we saw that `nums[4] == nums[2]`. But we don\\'t want to remove it since we added the extra `2`. We must add the offset, which is `i - current`, where `i` is the pointer of the original array. So the comparation will be between `nums[i]` and `nums[i - 2 - (i - current)]`, which is `nums[current - 2]`.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {\\n        int current = 2;\\n        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {\\n            if (nums[i] != nums[current - 2]) {\\n                nums[current++] = nums[i];\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return current;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

If the values in the num column match for all three copies, then we have found a row where the number appears at least three times consecutively. We can use the DISTINCT keyword to remove duplicates and the ORDER BY keyword to sort the result table.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nSELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums\\nFROM Logs l1\\nJOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id = l2.id - 1\\nJOIN Logs l3 ON l1.id = l3.id - 2\\nWHERE l1.num = l2.num AND l2.num = l3.num;\\n\\n```\\nWe join the table Logs with itself three times, using aliases l1, l2, and l3.

Window functions can be efficient, but the performance can be influenced by the size of the logs table and the ordering requirements. It\\'s important to ensure appropriate indexes are in place to support the window functions and sorting.\\n\\n- Readability: This option utilizes the power of window functions to compare consecutive rows. It expresses the logic succinctly, making it easier to understand for developers familiar with window functions. However, for those less familiar with window functions, the syntax and the concept of lag and lead functions might require some understanding.\\n\\n# Option 2: Joins\\n```\\nselect \\n    distinct l1.num as ConsecutiveNums\\nfrom \\n    logs l1 \\ninner join \\n    logs l2 \\non l1.id = l2.id + 1 and l1.num = l2.num \\ninner join logs l3 \\non l2.id = l3.id + 1 and l2.num = l3.num\\n```\\n- Performance: This option uses self-joins to compare consecutive rows based on the `id` and `num` columns. The performance can depend on the size of the `logs` table and the presence of appropriate indexes on the `id` and `num` columns. Joins can be efficient, but it\\'s crucial to ensure the indexes are optimized.\\n- Readability: This option expresses the logic using self-joins, which can be more familiar to developers with SQL background. The joins represent the consecutive row comparison, and the logic is relatively straightforward to follow.\\n\\n# Option 3: Implicit Joins\\n```\\nSELECT DISTINCT\\n    l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums\\nFROM\\n    Logs l1,\\n    Logs l2,\\n    Logs l3\\nWHERE\\n    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1\\n    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1\\n    AND l1.Num = l2.Num\\n    AND l2.Num = l3.Num\\n\\n```\\n- Performance: This option uses implicit joins in the WHERE clause to compare consecutive rows based on the `id` and `num` columns. The performance can depend on the size of the `logs` table and the presence of appropriate indexes. Similar to Option 2, it\\'s important to optimize the indexes for better performance.\\n- Readability: Implicit joins can be less readable compared to explicit joins. While the logic is expressed using simple comparisons in the WHERE clause, it might require careful examination to understand the relationship between the joins and the consecutive row comparison.\\n\\n# Conclusion:\\n\\n- If performance is a top priority, Option 1 (Derived Table) is likely to perform well, especially if appropriate indexes are in place. Window functions can be efficient for comparing consecutive rows.\\n- If readability is a priority, Option 2 (Joins) might be the preferred choice. Self-joins are more familiar to SQL developers and can be easier to understand.\\n- Option 3 (Implicit Joins) may be less preferred in terms of readability due to the implicit nature of the joins.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to benchmark and test the performance of these options with your specific dataset and workload to determine the best-performing option in your environment.

This is due to the last colum\\'s ```Partition By num```. ```Partition By``` works like ```Group By```, but display all the records and the record in the same group are displayed together. Therefore, to make sure all the 1s are displayed together, id 5 and id 4 are exchanged. Since we have also included ```order by id```, then in every group, the ids should be in ascending order.\\n\\nYou may wonder \"What\\'s the matter about the grouping with partition by?

The second row value increment 1 as id increases, no matter the value is consecutive or not. The first value increment 1 only if the nums are consecutive. If your nums are consecutive, then both value increment 1, thus the **difference is always the same**!\\n\\n### For the result of the query\\nYou are basically only grabing the part where values in the third column, \\'ConsecutiveGroup\\' or ```ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY num ORDER BY id) ``` that are same and count for the number of consecutive value you want.\\n\\n## Comment Below if You have any question or confusion!!!\\n\\nThis solution is inspired by [@neilsons](https://leetcode-cn.com/u/neilsons/)",

As the name suggests, the `LAG` function has the ability to fetch data from a previous row, while `LEAD` fetches data from a subsequent row. You can visit [this website](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertutorial/9127/sql-server-window-functions-lead-and-lag/) if you want to know more.\\n\\nFirst, we create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `logs_lag_lead`. This CTE retrieves the `id` and `num` columns from the `Logs` table along with two new columns:\\n\\n- `lag_num`, which stores the preceding number (if one exists, else `null`), and\\n- `lead_num`, which stores the succeeding number (if one exists, else `null`).\\n\\nThe contents of the cte are shown below:\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/c2e62932-4a50-49f8-bded-cd88c5d05666_1650615007.1811059.png)\\n\\nNotice that when we have three consecutive numbers (first three rows, marked by the red rectangle), the row corresponding to the middle number will have an equal value for `num`, `lag_num`, and `lead_num` (marked by the blue rectangle). That\\'s because these two window functions retrieve the previous and following row values that are equal to `num`. \\n\\nWe finalise our solution by writing a simple query that contains the condition `num = lag_num AND num = lead_num` in the `WHERE` clause. Notice that we need to retrieve distinct rows. That\\'s because there might be more than three consecutive numbers; in that case, all middle rows will satisfy the `WHERE` condition, and the query will return the same number multiple times.",

Use a subquery to select the Num column from the Logs table, along with a calculated column freq that represents the frequency of each number in the sequence of numbers.\\n2. Use the @prev and @cnt variables to keep track of the previous number and the frequency of the current number, respectively.\\n3. If the current number is the same as the previous number, increment the frequency by 1. Otherwise, reset the frequency to 1.\\n4. Use the outer query to select the distinct numbers that have a frequency greater than 2 (i.e., appear consecutively three or more times).\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe time complexity of this query depends on the size of the Logs table and the efficiency of the database engine\\'s query optimizer. In general, the time complexity of a subquery with a GROUP BY clause is O(n * log n), where n is the number of rows in the table. However, the use of variables to calculate the frequency may help to optimize the query execution plan and reduce the actual time complexity.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe space complexity of this query depends on the size of the result set and the size of the columns being selected. In this case, the result set will have at most as many rows as the number of distinct numbers that appear consecutively three or more times in the Logs table. Therefore, the space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of distinct numbers that meet the criteria. The space used by the variables @prev and @cnt is constant, so it does not affect the overall space complexity.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n# Write your MySQL query statement below\\nselect distinct Num as ConsecutiveNums from \\n(\\n    select\\n    Num, @cnt := if(@prev = (@prev := Num), @cnt + 1, 1) as freq\\n    from\\n    Logs, (Select @cnt := 0, @prev := (select Num from Logs limit 1)) as C\\n)\\nas n\\nwhere freq > 2\\n```",

We know that we can retrieve an item from a set, and not know what that item will be, but that would not be actually random. (This is due to the way python implements sets. In python3, when using integers, elements are popped from the set in the order they appear in the underlying \\nhashtable. Hence, not actually random.)\\n\\nA set is implemented essentially the same as a dict in python, so the time complexity of add / delete is on average O(1). When it comes to the random function, however, we run into the problem of needing to convert the data into a python list in order to return a random element. That conversion will add a significant overhead to getRandom, thus slowing the whole thing down.\\n\\nInstead of having to do that type conversion (set to list) we can take an approach that involves maintaining both a list and a dictionary side by side. That might look something like:\\n\\n```\\ndata_map == {4: 0, 6: 1, 2: 2, 5: 3}\\ndata == [4, 6, 2, 5]\\n```\\n\\nNotice that the key in the `data_map` is the element in the list, and the value in the `data_map` is the index the element is at in the list. \\n\\nLet\\'s look at the implementation:\\n\\n```python\\nclass RandomizedSet:\\n\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.data_map = {} # dictionary, aka map, aka hashtable, aka hashmap\\n        self.data = [] # list aka array\\n\\n    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:\\n\\n        # the problem indicates we need to return False if the item \\n        # is already in the RandomizedSet---checking if it\\'s in the\\n        # dictionary is on average O(1) where as\\n        # checking the array is on average O(n)\\n        if val in self.data_map:\\n            return False\\n\\n        # add the element to the dictionary. Setting the value as the \\n        # length of the list will accurately point to the index of the \\n        # new element. (len(some_list) is equal to the index of the last item +1)\\n        self.data_map[val] = len(self.data)\\n\\n        # add to the list\\n        self.data.append(val)\\n        \\n        return True\\n\\n    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:\\n\\n        # again, if the item is not in the data_map, return False. \\n        # we check the dictionary instead of the list due to lookup complexity\\n        if not val in self.data_map:\\n            return False\\n\\n        # essentially, we\\'re going to move the last element in the list \\n        # into the location of the element we want to remove. \\n        # this is a significantly more efficient operation than the obvious \\n        # solution of removing the item and shifting the values of every item \\n        # in the dicitionary to match their new position in the list\\n        last_elem_in_list = self.data[-1]\\n        index_of_elem_to_remove = self.data_map[val]\\n\\n        self.data_map[last_elem_in_list] = index_of_elem_to_remove\\n        self.data[index_of_elem_to_remove] = last_elem_in_list\\n\\n        # change the last element in the list to now be the value of the element \\n        # we want to remove\\n        self.data[-1] = val\\n\\n        # remove the last element in the list\\n        self.data.pop()\\n\\n        # remove the element to be removed from the dictionary\\n        self.data_map.pop(val)\\n        return True\\n\\n    def getRandom(self) -> int:\\n        # if running outside of leetcode, you need to `import random`.\\n        # random.choice will randomly select an element from the list of data.\\n        return random.choice(self.data)\\n```\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n1) this can be made more efficient by removing the variables `last_elem_in_list` and `index_of_elem_to_remove`. I have used this to aid in readability. \\n2) the remove operation might appear complicated so here\\'s a before and after of what the data looks like:\\n\\n```\\nelement_to_remove = 7\\n\\nbefore:     [4, 7, 9, 3, 5]\\nafter:      [4, 5, 9, 3]\\n\\nbefore:     {4:0, 7:1, 9:2, 3:3, 5:4}\\nafter:      {4:0, 9:2, 3:3, 5:1}\\n```\\n\\nAll we\\'re doing is replacing the element in the list that needs to be removed with the last element in the list. And then we update the values in the dictionary to reflect that.",

                "content": "I had this problem a long time ago in a phone interview with Google and passed it with a hint from the interviewer. Here is what happened:\\n - I started to give the most naive approach.\\n - **init**: create a empty list ```arr```. O(1)\\n - **insert**: Append a new ```val``` to the ```arr```. O(1)\\n - **remove**: Find the index of the ```val``` in the array using ```self.arr.index(val)```, and remove it. O(n)\\n - **getRandom**: random.choice(self.arr) O(1)\\n\\nThe time complexity is O(n) for **remove**, which is not right. So I started to optimize it.\\n - I knew that the indices in the array were important, but I wasn\\'t sure why or what to do with them. So I just created an empty hashmap ```indices```, while talking to the interviewer just to buy myself some time and hopping to get some information from the interviewer.\\n - I modified ```insert``` and ```remove``` by updating the indices when there is a new ```val```, or I need to remove a ```val```.\\n - **Then I got stuck**, I started thinking (and also talking to the interviewer) about how to get the index of ```val``` in ```arr```, will binary search work here somehow? (obviously, I\\'m on the wrong track because remove an element in a list is O(n))\\n - The interviewer was kindly enough and said, **Think about how to remove an element in a list in O(1)**)\\n - **There is only one way, which is arr.pop()**\\n - Then I started to think in this direction, **If I want to remove an element, I need to put it to the end of the ```arr```, and pop it**\\n - What about the element which was originally at the end? I can put it to the position where the ```val``` need to be removed.\\n - Then the algorithm is obvious, \\n (1) Get the index ```i``` of the ```val``` from ```indices```.\\n (2) Update the index of ```arr[-1]``` to ```i``` in the ```indices```, \\n (3) Move the last element ```arr[-1]``` to the i th position.\\n (4) ```pop``` the last element from ```arr``` and remove ```val``` from ```indices```.\\n \\n```python\\nclass RandomizedSet:\\n\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        # Store the index of each val in self.arr.\\n        self.indices = {}\\n        # Store all vals.\\n        self.arr = []\\n\\n    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:\\n        # Return False if val is already present as requested.\\n        if val in self.indices: return False\\n        \\n        # Append val to the array.\\n        # Store its index in the hashmap\\n        self.arr.append(val)\\n        self.indices[val] = len(self.arr)-1\\n        return True\\n    \\n    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:\\n        # Return False if val is not present as requested.\\n        if val not in self.indices: return False\\n        \\n        # Get the index of the val that needs to be removed.\\n        i = self.indices[val]\\n        \\n        # Update the index of arr[-1] in the indices.\\n        self.indices[self.arr[-1]] = i\\n        \\n        # Move the last element to the i th position.\\n        self.arr[i] = self.arr[-1]\\n        \\n        # remove the last element, and remove the index of val\\n        self.indices.pop(val)\\n        self.arr.pop()\\n        \\n        return True\\n\\n    def getRandom(self) -> int:\\n        return random.choice(self.arr)\\n```\\n\\nNow try the follow up question **[381.

If we use an array as the data structure, insertion at the end will be in O(1) time but searching whether the element is already present in the array will take O(N) time. Removal of the element will require searching for the element which will take O(N) time and left shifting the subsequent array elements will also take O(N) time. Getting random element will take O(1) time using the rand() function. So, we need some additional data structure that allows us to locate the array index for removal and also to search whether the element is already present or not.

                "content": "My idea for this problem to achieve `O(1)` complexity for all three operation is to use 2 dictionaries: I called them direct dictionary `dic_direct` and inverse dictionary `dic_invert`.\\n1. In direct dictionary we keep indexes and corresponding values: for example: `0:3`, `1:4`, `2:1` means, that we have `3` values in our dictionary: `[3,4,1]`.\\n2. In invert dictionary we keep the opposite correspondences: `3:0`, `4:1`, `1:2`. Why we need to keep two dictionaries? Because we want to search quickly both by keys and by values.\\n3. `num_elem` is to count number of elements in our set (you can avoid it, but code becomes a bit more readible).\\n\\n**Insert**. When we do insert, we first check if element is already in our invert dictionary, because we are looking for value. We do it in `O(1)`. If element is not here, we just add it to the \"end\" of our dictionaries, by this I mean, we add it with biggest existing index in dicionary, increased by `1`. For example if we want to add new element `10` into  `0:3`, `1:4`, `2:1`, then we have  `0:3`, `1:4`, `2:1`, `3:10`.\\n\\n**Remove:** this one is a bit more complicated. Imagine, that we want to remove element `4` from `0:3`, `1:4`, `2:1`, `3:10`. What we need to do in this case? We find it and delete first, but now we have **gap** in our indexes: `0:3`, `2:1`, `3:10`. We can easily fix it, let us take the last element and put it into our gap, so we have `0:3`, `1:10`, `2:1` now. If we do not have **gap**, that is we removed the last element, then we do not need to do this action. In any case we have `O(1)` complexity.\\n\\n**getRandom** This one is easy, we just generate random number, uniformly distributed between `0` and `1`, multiply it by number of all elements in set and evaluate `floor` function. For example if we have 5 elements, and we generated number `0.7`, then we need to choose element number `3`. Complexity is `O(1)`.\\n\\n```\\nclass RandomizedSet:\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.dic_direct = {}\\n        self.dic_invert = {}\\n        self.num_elem = 0\\n        \\n    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:\\n        if val in self.dic_invert:\\n            return False\\n        else:\\n            self.dic_invert[val] = self.num_elem\\n            self.dic_direct[self.num_elem] = val\\n            self.num_elem += 1\\n            return True\\n        \\n    def remove(self, val):\\n        if val not in self.dic_invert:\\n            return False\\n        else:\\n            ind = self.dic_invert.pop(val)\\n            self.dic_direct.pop(ind)\\n            if ind != self.num_elem - 1:\\n                self.dic_direct[ind] = self.dic_direct[self.num_elem - 1]\\n                self.dic_invert[self.dic_direct[self.num_elem - 1]] = ind\\n                self.dic_direct.pop(self.num_elem - 1)\\n            self.num_elem -= 1\\n            return True\\n        \\n    def getRandom(self):\\n        index = floor(random.random()*self.num_elem)\\n        return self.dic_direct[index]\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

We could get a random number by `Math.random`, and use an array to store index-based values.\\n\\nBut when we try to finish the code, we may find the `remove` method could not be easy, since if we use something like `splice` to remove the value in an array, it could be not O(1) depends on the implementation, and all the indexes after this element need to be updated.\\n\\nSo, here comes the final key point for this problem, how do we make it O(1) with steady indexes?

We must put a value here.\\n- If we wanna remove a value with O(1) in a list, it\\'s straightforward to think about removing the last value.\\n\\nCombined with these clues, it is not difficult for us to find out that we could swap the target value and the last value, then remove it.

Time complexity is constant: **O(1)**. Space complexity is linear: **O(N)**.\\n****\\n\\n**Comment.** Set collections with **O(1)** access time (e.g., *set* in Python or *unordered_set* in C++) do not provide arbitrary access, they are *hashmaps*. This means that we can not query an element by it\\'s index. On the other hand, *SortedSet* (from Python\\'s sortedcontainers) and *set* (C++) store keys in order and do provide access by index, but that\\'s of at least **O(logN)** complexity. As it\\'s common in the data structure development, we can trade space for time. Namely, maintain an additional structure that allows **O(1)** access time. This is possible when we deal with continuously allocated chunks of memory (i.e., arrays), for which we know their precise position (pointer/reference) in memory and can simply shift this position by **k** to get access to the **k**-th element.\\n\\nSo our strategy will be the following.\\n1. Keep a duplicate of all values in the form of array. Now we can query values by index (a random/pseudorandom index in our case).\\n2. When we want to delete a value (by value, not by index), it should also be removed from this array. Thus, for each value we have to store it\\'s index in the array. For this, a hashmap (*dict* in *Python* or *unordered_map* in C++) suffices.\\n3. Insertion is trivial: extend the array by the given value and store its index (i.e., the last index) in the hashmap.\\n4. Deletion is tricky. When we retrieve the index of some value from the hashmap, it\\'s usually somewhere in the middle of the array. To not shift/reallocate space (that is very costly), we simply swap the last value in the array (and pop it) with the removed one. Effectively, this leads to the deletion of the queried value.\\n\\n**Python.** *dict* + *list*.\\n```\\nclass RandomizedSet:\\n\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.vals = {}  \\n        self.idxs = []\\n\\n    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:\\n        if val in self.vals : return False \\n        self.vals[val] = len(self.idxs)\\n        self.idxs.append(val)\\n        return True\\n\\n    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:\\n        if val in self.vals: \\n            lst = self.idxs[-1]     \\n            pos = self.vals[val]\\n            \\n            self.vals[lst] = pos               # move last value to the space\\n            self.idxs[pos] = lst               # occupied by the queried one...\\n            \\n            self.vals.pop(val)                 # ...and delete the respective\\n            self.idxs.pop()                    # data from both structures\\n            \\n            return True\\n        return False\\n\\n    def getRandom(self) -> int:\\n        return random.choice(self.idxs)        # as simple as that\\n```\\n\\n**C++.** *unordered_map* + *vector*.\\n```\\nclass RandomizedSet \\n{\\n    unordered_map<int,int> vals;\\n    vector<int>            idxs;\\n\\npublic:\\n    RandomizedSet() {}\\n    \\n    bool insert(int val) \\n    {\\n        if (vals.count(val)) return false;\\n        vals[val] = idxs.size();\\n        idxs.push_back(val);\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    \\n    bool remove(int val)\\n    {\\n        if (!vals.count(val)) return false;\\n        \\n        int lst = idxs.back();\\n        int pos = vals[val];\\n        \\n        vals[lst] = pos;\\n        idxs[pos] = lst;\\n        \\n        vals.erase(val);\\n        idxs.pop_back();\\n        \\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    \\n    int getRandom() \\n    {\\n        return idxs[rand() % idxs.size()];\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "In order to have O(1) `insert` and `remove` operations, we need an unordered set or dict.\\nIn order to have O(1) `getRandom` operations, we need a data structure with random access. That means we need a `list`. (vector in C)\\nThe hardest part is connecting the two.\\n\\nWhat we can do is have a dictionary (map in C) that for every value we store the index in the list of that value. This way, when we need to remove an element by its value, we know what element from the list to remove without having to traverse the whole list.\\nRemoving an element from the middle of the list while preserving the order of everything else is O(N). But we don\\'t need to preserve the order. So when removing an element from the middle of the list, we can just swap it with the last element of the list, then remove the last element of the list. This makes the remove operation O(1) as whole. Care must be taken to maintain the dictionary of indexes for the swap!\\n\\nCode follows:\\n\\n```\\nclass RandomizedSet:\\n\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.elems = []\\n        self.indexes = {}\\n        \\n\\n    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:\\n        if val in self.indexes:\\n            return False\\n\\t\\t# New element will be at the end of list\\n        self.indexes[val] = len(self.elems)\\n        self.elems.append(val)\\n        return True\\n        \\n\\n    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:\\n        if val not in self.indexes:\\n            return False\\n\\n        val_index = self.indexes[val]\\n        last = self.elems[-1]\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t# We\\'re swapping the removed element with the last element in the list.\\n\\t\\t# The last element will move to the position of the element removed.\\n        if val_index < len(self.elems)-1:  # Make sure we\\'re not already last element\\n            self.elems[val_index] = last\\n            self.indexes[last] = val_index\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t# Remove the last element.

                "content": "# Init Function\\nTo keep everything O(1), we have to use a hashmap. \\n\\n**Why hashmap is goated:**\\n1. getting items is constant time\\n2. adding items is constant time\\n3. deleting items is constant time\\n4. checking if items exist is constant time\\n5. editing items is constant time\\n\\nHashmap is `value:index`, btw\\nSo we have a hashmap and an array.\\n\\n# Insert\\nSince nobody likes edge cases, we\\'ll take care of that first: `if val in self.dict: return False`. \\n**Digression Alert:**\\nNotice how I check it with a hashmap? That\\'s O(1). However, if I say `if val in self.list`, then it\\'s O(n). I only add and pop items from the actual list. (You\\'ll see why I pop in just a second)\\n\\n**Back on topic**\\nWe basically append the value to both the goated hashmap and the not-so-goated array:\\n1. for the hashmap, we set `val`\\'s value as the dict\\'s key and `val`\\'s index to the dict\\'s value. (ik it\\'s kinda confusing, go read it again). Since we are appending, the `val`\\'s index will ofc be the last element (length of list)\\n2. for the array, we use the append function\\n\\nAlso don\\'t forget to return true.\\n\\n# Remove\\nThe remove function for an array is O(n), but for a hashmap is O(1). But we have to do it for both. So, how?\\n\\n**Nice little trick:**\\nFact 1: the `pop()` function is O(1)\\nFact 2: you can only `pop()` the last element of an array\\nDoubt: but what if the `val` is in the middle?\\nFact 3: swapping elements is O(1)\\n\\n**THEREFORE**\\nWe swap the value we want to remove with the last value of the array, then pop that value. Ta-da! Constant time!\\n\\nNote: this gets tricky\\n1. we get the last element\\'s value and index\\n2. We set `val`\\'s position in the list to the last element of the list\\'s value\\n3. We set the `val`\\'s value in the dict to the last element of the list\\'s index\\n\\nWe basically overwrite the lsat value in the list, cuz it\\'s going to be deleted anyways. \\n\\nAnd of course we remove the last element from the list and the dict.\\n\\n# getRandom\\nThis is self explanatory. I use `random.choice(` to get a random element from the list.

The hash table stores the values and their indices in the array, while the array stores the actual values.\\n\\nThe insert method takes a value as input and adds it to the set if it does not already exist in the set. If the value already exists, it returns False to indicate that the operation was not successful. To check if the value exists in the set, the hash table is checked. If the value does not exist, the value is added to the end of the array, and the value-index pair is added to the hash table. The time complexity of this method is O(1) on average.\\n\\nThe remove method takes a value as input and removes it from the set if it exists in the set. If the value does not exist, it returns False to indicate that the operation was not successful. To check if the value exists in the set, the hash table is checked. If the value exists, the index of the value in the array is obtained from the hash table, and the last value in the array is obtained. The value at the index is replaced with the last value in the array, and the index of the last value in the hash table is updated. The last value in the array is then removed, and the value-index pair for the removed value is removed from the hash table. The time complexity of this method is O(1) on average.\\n\\nThe getRandom method returns a random value from the set. To do this, a random value is chosen from the array using the random.choice method. The time complexity of this method is O(1) on average.\\n\\nOverall, the time complexity of each method is O(1) on average since all operations involve constant time hash table and array operations. The space complexity of the class is O(n), where n is the number of values in the set, since it uses a hash table and an array to store the values.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass RandomizedSet:\\n\\n  def __init__(self):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Initialize your data structure here.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    self.val_to_index = {}  # Hash table to store values and their indices in the array\\n    self.vals = []          # Array to store the actual values\\n\\n  def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Inserts a value to the set.

Inserting and deleting in constant time means hashtable. But when I start working on the get random, it starts to get trickier. I was initially thinking that I can find random in constant time using unordered_set iterator and do something like (ht.begin()+somerandint). But I realized that ht iterator is not a random access iterator, meaning in order to get to a specific iterator I have to iterator from the begin iterator which takes linear time. Therefore, we need a container with random access. vector is an obvious choice. But I was stuck again, because vector erasing sounds like linear time. After looking at the solution, I realize that the erasing is usually linear because we need to keep the order vector. In cases like this, we don\\'t care about maintaining the order of elements and removing a specific element can be done in constant time by utilizing pop_back().\\n\\nNot very familiar with the random stl class, so if there\\'s a better way to get rand from a vector, let me know.",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nThe problem requires us to implement a data structure called RandomizedSet, which supports three operations: insert, remove, and getRandom. The insert operation adds a value to the set if it doesn\\'t already exist and returns true, or returns false if the value already exists. The remove operation removes a value from the set if it exists and returns true, or returns false if the value doesn\\'t exist. The getRandom operation returns a random value from the set.\\n\\n# Approach\\nTo solve this problem, we can use a combination of a Set and an array. We\\'ll use the Set to store the unique values and ensure constant-time operations for checking existence and removing values. We\\'ll use the array to store the values in a random order and facilitate the getRandom operation.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of each operation:\\n\\n1. insert(val: number): boolean: To insert a value, we\\'ll first check if it already exists in the set using set.has(val). If it does, we\\'ll return false to indicate that the value was not inserted. Otherwise, we\\'ll add the value to both the set and the array, and return true.\\n\\n2. remove(val: number): boolean: To remove a value, we\\'ll first check if it exists in the set using set.has(val). If it doesn\\'t, we\\'ll return false to indicate that the value was not removed. Otherwise, we\\'ll delete the value from both the set and the array. To efficiently remove the value from the array, we\\'ll swap it with the last value in the array and then pop the last element. This way, the array remains in a random order even after removal. Finally, we\\'ll return true.\\n\\n3. getRandom(): number: To get a random value, we\\'ll convert the set to an array using Array.from(set). Then, we\\'ll generate a random index within the bounds of the array using Math.random() * array.length. Finally, we\\'ll return the value at the random index.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nInsert: O(1)\\nRemove: O(1)\\ngetRandom: O(1)\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(n), where n is the number of elements in the set.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass RandomizedSet {\\n    private set: Set<number>;\\n    private array: number[];\\n\\n    constructor() {\\n        this.set = new Set<number>();\\n        this.array = [];\\n    }\\n\\n    insert(val: number): boolean {\\n        if (this.set.has(val)) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        this.set.add(val);\\n        this.array.push(val);\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n\\n    remove(val: number): boolean {\\n        if (!this.set.has(val)) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        this.set.delete(val);\\n        const index = this.array.indexOf(val);\\n        this.array[index] = this.array[this.array.length - 1];\\n        this.array.pop();\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n\\n    getRandom(): number {\\n        const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.array.length);\\n        return this.array[randomIndex];\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\n/**\\n * Your RandomizedSet object will be instantiated and called as such:\\n * var obj = new RandomizedSet()\\n * var param_1 = obj.insert(val)\\n * var param_2 = obj.remove(val)\\n * var param_3 = obj.getRandom()\\n */\\n```",

But we can do it in O(1) time if we can store the indexes of each element in array somewhere so that instead of traversing each time for deletion, we can directly go to that index and delete.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n1. We can use unordered map to store the indexes as it operates in constant time complexity.\\n2. While inserting the val to our set, we will store its index in map.\\n3. While deleting, we can simply pop back after locating the last element to current index as order of elements do not matter here.\\n4. Update the index of last element in map which was shifted.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(1)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(N)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass RandomizedSet {\\npublic:\\n    vector<int> set;\\n    unordered_map<int,int> indexFinder;\\n    RandomizedSet() {\\n        //RandomizedSet randomizedSet = new RandomizedSet();\\n    }\\n    \\n    bool insert(int val) {\\n        if(indexFinder.find(val) != indexFinder.end()) return false;\\n        else\\n        {\\n            set.push_back(val);\\n            indexFinder[val] = set.size()-1;\\n            return true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    bool remove(int val) {\\n        if(indexFinder.find(val) == indexFinder.end()) return false;\\n        else{\\n            int lastEle = set.back();\\n            int indexToBeRemoved = indexFinder[val];\\n            set[indexToBeRemoved] = lastEle;\\n            set.pop_back();\\n            indexFinder[lastEle] = indexToBeRemoved;\\n            indexFinder.erase(val);\\n            return true;\\n\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    int getRandom() {\\n        return set[rand()%set.size()];\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n/**\\n * Your RandomizedSet object will be instantiated and called as such:\\n * RandomizedSet* obj = new RandomizedSet();\\n * bool param_1 = obj->insert(val);\\n * bool param_2 = obj->remove(val);\\n * int param_3 = obj->getRandom();\\n */\\n```",

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n- As the name of the class says, it shall behave like a set upon insertion or removal of values. So a \"set-ish\" abstract data type is needed to store the values, and will allow constant access times for insertion and removal.\\n- The randomized get() requires to use a random number generator to calculate the choice, and one can assume, that the library standard provides such a constant time random number generator.\\n- But the Java sets do not provide constant time random access methods to the stored items by index. Thus, a common set must probably be iterated.\\n- To support both acess methods (insert/remove by key, and get by randomized index), a kind of hybrid data structure is needed: a set that can be accessed randomly by index, like a list, and by key, like a set or map.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n- Use a HashMap to store the inserted values (as keys), so that the set aspect gets satisfied.\\n- Use an ArrayList to store the values as themselves, and use the indexes of the values in the list as values for the key map. This satisfies the random access by index requirement.\\n- Both tables are associated by the indexes:\\n  - HashMap: value (key aspect) --> index\\n  - ArrayList: index --> value (value aspect).\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(1)$$ average for all operations\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where n is the number of items stored in the class at any time.

At first sight we observe that both insert and remove operation are satisfied by using set in O(1). Let us say that we are using unordered_set for first 2 operations, than we found that to get any random value from the set you have to iterate over it as set or even map does not support getting any value in O(1) but using vector you can achieve this, as with index value you can access any item in array in O(1).\\n\\nThus using set alone you cannot achieve all the 3 functions in required time. Thus use of set is eliminanted from above discussion.\\n\\nNow we have to use 2 different data structure one is unordered map and another is a vector\\nkey as the given val and value as index of the vector where that value is stored in vector.\\nSo, when we remove anything from map we should also remove it from vector.\\n***Now you say that removing something from vector is not O(1) as we are required to do because when remove function is called we should delete our value both from map and vector.

The average time complexity of search , insert and remove elements from a hashmap is O(1).\\n\\nHowever , here we need to support \"Random()\" access in O(1) as well. so we are using a vector here to achieve that.\\nHere is the trick to remove in constant time.\\nHere is the pseudo-code\\n\\n1) If the element you are trying to remove is the last element in the vector, remove it, done, ELSE,\\n2) Read the last element of the vector and write it over the element-to-be-removed\\n\\n3) Now remove the last element of the vector. (C++ pop_back() in a vector is O(1))\\nThat is exactly the trick we are using here, only that we need to update our hashmap as well.",

This can be solved by using a HashMap to keep the indexes of the values, so when you need to remove a value you know where to remove the value from. \\nthe new problem is that removing a value will change the indexes in all the values following the deleted one, adjusting the values would bump complexity to O(n) (remember we want O(1)). So what if no value follows the deleted one... so you guessed it, the fix to this problem is to always delete the value at the end, that way there are no indexes to be adjusted. so first you swap the value to be deleted with the last value, and then you delete the last value. I hope this was helpful. remember to vote up in case you found this useful :)\\n```\\nclass RandomizedSet {\\n    Map<Integer, Integer> valToPos = new HashMap<>();\\n    List <Integer> vals = new ArrayList<>();\\n    Random rand = new Random();\\n    public RandomizedSet() {\\n        \\n    }\\n    \\n    public boolean insert(int val) {\\n        if(valToPos.containsKey(val)) return false;\\n        vals.add(val);\\n        valToPos.put(val, vals.size()-1);\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    \\n    public boolean remove(int val) {\\n        if(!valToPos.containsKey(val)) return false;\\n        int pos = valToPos.remove(val);\\n        int last = vals.remove(vals.size() - 1);\\n        if(pos == vals.size()) return true;\\n        vals.set(pos, last);\\n        valToPos.put(last, pos);\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    \\n    public int getRandom() {\\n        return vals.get(rand.nextInt(vals.size()));\\n    }\\n}",

Say your insert order is like this\n1,10,4\nYour dictionary would be\n{{1,0}, {10,1},{4,2}}\nIf you call remove(10), you would need to\n - Find the index for 10\n - Remove 10 from the list,\n - Remove {10,1} from the dictionary\n - Update every record in your dictionary pointing to index > 1\nIf you miss this last step (which makes it O(n)), when you then call Remove(4), it will try to look for IX 2, which doesnt exist in your list anymore, throwing an exception. Each of the others carry other issues of varying weight, but all can create unnecessary bugs in your code.\n\nBy using a hashset, I was able to get performance in the >90% for speed and >80% for memory.\n"

                "content": "To calculate the median, we can maintain divide array into subarray equally: **small** and **large**. All elements in **small** are no larger than any element in **large**. So median would be (largest in **small** + smallest in **large**) / 2 if **small**\\'s size = **large**\\'s size. If large\\'s size = small\\'s size + 1, median is smallest in **large**.\\n\\nThus, we can use heap here to maintain **small**(max heap) and **large**(min heap) so we can fetch smallest and largest element in logarithmic time.\\n\\nWe can also maintain \"**large**\\'s size - **small**\\'s size <= 1\" and \"smallest in **large** >= largest in **small**\" by heap\\'s property: once **large**\\'s size - **small**\\'s size > 1, we pop one element from large and add it to small. And vice versa when **small**\\'s size > **large**\\'s size.\\n\\nBesides, since its a sliding window median, we need to keep track of window ends. So we will also push element\\'s index to the heap. So each element takes a form of (val, index). Since Python\\'s heapq is a min heap, so we convert small to a max heap by pushing (-val, index).\\n\\nIntially for first k elements, we push them all into **small** and then pop k/2 element from **small** and add them to **large**. \\nThen we can intialize our answer array as ```[large[0][0] if k & 1 else (large[0][0]-small[0][0])/2]``` as we discussed above.\\n\\nThen for rest iterations, each time we add a new element **x** whose index is **i+k**, and remove an old element **nums[i]** which is out of window scope. Then we calculate our median in current window as the same way before.\\nIf right end\\'s **x** is no smaller than **large[0]**, then it belongs to **large** heap. If left end\\'s **nums[i]** is no larger than **large[0]**, then it belongs to **small** heap. So we will add one to **large** while remove one from **small** and heaps\\' sizes will be unbalanced. So we will move **large[0]** to **small** to rebalance two heaps.\\nVice versa when we have to add one to **small** while remove one from **large**.\\n\\nBut we don\\'t have to hurry and remove element in each iteration. As long as **nums[i]** is neither **small[0]** nor **large[0]**, it has no effect to median calculation. So we wait later and use a while loop to remove those out-of-window **small[0]** or **large[0]** at one time.

Use two ```Heaps``` to store numbers. ```maxHeap``` for numbers smaller than current median,  ```minHeap``` for numbers bigger than and ```equal``` to current median.

I ended up using the same template as in Question 295 and passed all tests on my first attempt. The key is using two heaps (just like 295) and keeping track of just two things - the element to include and the element to remove. Below is my Python solution:\\n```\\nimport heapq\\nfrom collections import defaultdict\\nclass Solution:\\n    def medianSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[float]:\\n        if not nums or not k:\\n            return []\\n        lo = [] # max heap\\n        hi = [] # min heap\\n        for i in range(k):\\n            if len(lo) == len(hi):\\n                heapq.heappush(hi, -heapq.heappushpop(lo, -nums[i]))\\n            else:\\n                heapq.heappush(lo, -heapq.heappushpop(hi, nums[i]))\\n        ans = [float(hi[0])] if k & 1 else [(hi[0] - lo[0]) / 2.0]\\n        to_remove = defaultdict(int)\\n        for i in range(k, len(nums)): # right bound of window\\n            heapq.heappush(lo, -heapq.heappushpop(hi, nums[i])) # always push to lo\\n            out_num = nums[i-k]\\n            if out_num > -lo[0]:\\n                heapq.heappush(hi, -heapq.heappop(lo))\\n            to_remove[out_num] += 1\\n            while lo and to_remove[-lo[0]]:\\n                to_remove[-lo[0]] -= 1\\n                heapq.heappop(lo)\\n            while to_remove[hi[0]]:\\n                to_remove[hi[0]] -= 1\\n                heapq.heappop(hi)\\n            if k % 2:\\n                ans.append(float(hi[0]))\\n            else:\\n                ans.append((hi[0] - lo[0]) / 2.0)\\n        return ans\\n```\\nA few important things to clarify:\\n1. Two heaps (lo and hi). The size of hi, as measured by the number of **valid** elements it contains, is either equal to that of lo or one greater than that of lo, depending on the value of k. (This is an invariant we enforce when we add and remove elements from lo and hi). It\\'s worth noting that by \"valid\" I mean elements **within the current window**. \\n2. Lazy removal. I used a defaultdict to_remove to keep track of elements to be removed and their occurrances, and remove them if and only if they are at the top of either heaps. \\n3. How to add and remove. The logic is extremely straightforward. When adding a new element, we always add to lo. If the element to be removed is in lo as well, great! We don\\'t need to do anything because the heap sizes do not change. However, if the element to be removed happen to be in hi, we then pop an element from lo and add it to hi. **Important: that element we pop is guaranteed be a valid element(!!) because otherwise it should have been removed during the previous iteration.**\\n4. Some may be worried that removing elements makes heaps imbalanced. That never happens! No matter how many elements are removed at the end of an iteration, they are invalid elements! The heap lo can contain all the invalid elements and much greater in size than hi, but still in perfect balance with hi.

So the total complexicty becomes O(n * k)\\n* Sorted Set - It\\'s basically a advanced heap. The search, insert, delete all are O(log(k)).

Heap O(nk). Another simple idea is to reuse [295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/discuss/957550/Evolve-from-brute-force). Add is O(logk), findMedian is O(1), remove is O(k) for priorty queue. Same as 295, we want the invariance that heap sizes are be equal or the left heap is larger by 1 to simplify the logic to findMedian. This can be achieved by remove old number before adding new number. After removing, left size could be smaller by one or larger by two in the worst case. Then we add to the smaller heap to satisfy the invariance. \\n```\\n\\tpublic double[] medianSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {\\n        int n=nums.length;\\n        double[] median=new double[n-k+1];\\n        PriorityQueue<Integer> small=new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->b.compareTo(a)), large=new PriorityQueue<>();\\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {\\n            if(i>=k) {\\n                if(!small.remove(nums[i-k])) {\\n                    large.remove(nums[i-k]);   \\n                }\\n            }\\n            addNum(nums[i],small, large);\\n            if(i>=k-1)\\n                median[i-k+1] = findMedian(small, large);\\n        }\\n        return median;\\n    }\\n    private void addNum(int num, Queue<Integer> small, Queue<Integer> large) {\\n        if(small.size()>large.size()) {\\n            small.add(num);\\n            large.add(small.poll());\\n        } else {\\n            large.add(num);\\n            small.add(large.poll());      \\n        }\\n    }\\n    private double findMedian(Queue<Integer> small, Queue<Integer> large) {\\n        if(small.size()>large.size()) {\\n            return small.peek(); \\n        } else {\\n            return ((long)small.peek()+large.peek())/2.0;\\n        }\\n    }\\n```\\n3. Binary search tree O(nlogk). BST can remove in log(k). Use two bst to store the smaller half and the larger half of the current window. The challenge is how to store duplicate in BST. An easy approach is to store array index in BST and overload the comparator so that it is sorted by value.\\n* java\\n```\\n\\tpublic double[] medianSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {\\n        int n=nums.length;\\n        double[] median=new double[n-k+1];\\n        Comparator<Integer> comp = (i,j)->nums[i]==nums[j]?i-j:nums[i] - nums[j];\\n        TreeSet<Integer> small=new TreeSet<>(comp), large=new TreeSet<>(comp);\\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {\\n            if(i>=k) {\\n                if(!small.remove(i-k)) {\\n                    large.remove(i-k);   \\n                }\\n            }\\n            addNum(i, small, large);\\n            if(i>=k-1)\\n                median[i-k+1] = findMedian(nums, small, large);\\n        }\\n        return median;\\n    }\\n    private void addNum(int i, TreeSet<Integer> small, TreeSet<Integer> large) {\\n        if(small.size() > large.size()) {\\n            small.add(i);\\n            large.add(small.pollLast());     \\n        } else {\\n            large.add(i);\\n            small.add(large.pollFirst());        \\n        } \\n    }\\n    private double findMedian(int[] nums, TreeSet<Integer> small, TreeSet<Integer> large) {\\n        if(small.size() > large.size()) {\\n            return nums[small.last()]; \\n        } else {\\n            return ((long)nums[small.last()]+nums[large.first()])/2.0;\\n        }\\n    }\\n```\\nAfter each add or erase, the two bst are balanced so that their sizes differ by at most 1.

O(nlogk) , we can just use one bst and keep track of the middle element.

The idea is to keep the middle pointer points to index k/2 after insertion and erasure. \\n```\\n    vector<double> medianSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n        vector<double> med(n-k+1);\\n        multiset<double> window(nums.begin(),nums.begin()+k);\\n        auto m = next(window.begin(),k/2);\\n        for(int i=k;;i++) {\\n            med[i-k] = ((double)*m+*next(m,k%2-1))/2;\\n            if(i==n) return med;\\n            window.insert(nums[i]);\\n            if(nums[i]<*m) m--;\\n            if(nums[i-k]<=*m) m++;\\n            window.erase(window.lower_bound(nums[i-k]));\\n        }\\n    }\\n```",

                "content": "My solution is to store the K elements in the current window in a BST. The BST node has other two attributes: ```dup``` store the number of duplicates, ```left_count``` store the number of elements in the current node's left tree.\\n\\nThree methods of the BST class are implemented. ```insert``` inserts a new value to the tree, ```delete``` delete a value from the tree, ```find_kth```  find the kith smallest value in the tree. Each time the window moves, we deleted the old value, insert the new one, and using ```find_kth``` to find the median. All the above three methods are ```O(logk)```, so the time complexity is ```O(Nlogk)```\\n\\n\\n```\\nclass TreeNode(object):\\n    def __init__(self, val):\\n        self.val = val\\n        self.dup = 1\\n        self.left_count = 0\\n        self.left = None\\n        self.right = None\\n    \\n    def __repr__(self):\\n        return \"val: %r dup: %r small: %r\" %(self.val, self.dup, self.left_count)\\n        \\n\\nclass BST(object):\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.root = None\\n        self.count = 0\\n    \\n    def insert(self, num):\\n        #Insert number num into the BST\\n        self.count+=1\\n        \\n        if self.root==None:\\n            self.root = TreeNode(num)\\n            return\\n        \\n        prev, cur = None, self.root\\n        while cur is not None:\\n            prev = cur\\n            if cur.val == num:\\n                cur.dup+=1\\n                return\\n            elif cur.val < num:\\n                cur = cur.right\\n            else:\\n                #update the left_count\\n                cur.left_count+=1\\n                cur = cur.left\\n        if prev.val > num:\\n            prev.left = TreeNode(num)\\n        elif prev.val < num:\\n            prev.right = TreeNode(num)\\n        return\\n    \\n    def delete(self, num):\\n        #Delete number num from the BST, here it's guaranteed to find the number num\\n        self.count-=1\\n        \\n        prev, cur = None, self.root\\n        prev = TreeNode(-1000000)\\n        prev.right = self.root\\n        right_dir = True\\n        while True:\\n            if cur.val == num:\\n                break\\n            elif cur.val > num:\\n                cur.left_count-=1\\n                prev, cur = cur, cur.left\\n                right_dir = False\\n            else: #cur.val < num\\n                prev, cur = cur, cur.right\\n                right_dir = True\\n        \\n        #Find the node to delete, next step to delete the node\\n        if cur.dup>1:\\n            cur.dup-=1\\n            return\\n        \\n        #have to delete a node\\n        #node have no children\\n        if cur.left is None and cur.right is None:\\n            if cur==self.root: self.root=None\\n            elif right_dir: prev.right = None\\n            else: prev.left = None\\n            return\\n        #node have one childeren\\n        if cur.left is None:\\n            if cur == self.root: self.root = cur.right\\n            elif right_dir: prev.right = cur.right\\n            else: prev.left = cur.right\\n            return\\n        if cur.right is None:\\n            if cur == self.root: self.root = cur.left\\n            elif right_dir: prev.right = cur.left\\n            else: prev.left = cur.left\\n            return\\n        \\n        #node have two children\\n        next_prev, next_cur = cur, cur.right\\n        while next_cur.left is not None:\\n            next_prev, next_cur = next_cur, next_cur.left\\n        \\n        if next_cur == cur.right:\\n            cur.val = next_cur.val\\n            cur.dup = next_cur.dup\\n            cur.right = next_cur.right\\n            return\\n            \\n        elif next_cur != cur.right:\\n            next_prev.left = next_cur.right\\n            cur.val = next_cur.val\\n            cur.dup = next_cur.dup\\n            dup_to_del = cur.dup\\n            # next_prev.left = None\\n            p = cur.right\\n            while p is not None and p.val>=next_prev.val:\\n                p.left_count -= dup_to_del\\n                p = p.left\\n        return\\n    \\n    def find_median(self):\\n        k = (self.count+1)/2\\n        if self.count%2==1:\\n            return self.find_kth(k)+0.0\\n        else:\\n            return (0.+self.find_kth(k)+self.find_kth(k+1))/2\\n        \\n    def find_kth(self, k):\\n        #find the kth smallest element in the tree\\n        return self.find_kth_help(k, self.root)\\n        \\n    def find_kth_help(self, k, node):\\n        if node.left_count < k <= node.left_count+node.dup:\\n            return node.val\\n        if k <= node.left_count:\\n            return self.find_kth_help(k, node.left)\\n        else:\\n            return self.find_kth_help(k-node.left_count-node.dup, node.right)\\n\\n\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def medianSlidingWindow(self, nums, k):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type nums: List[int]\\n        :type k: int\\n        :rtype: List[float]\\n        \"\"\"\\n        if k==0:\\n            return []\\n        if k==1:\\n            return [i+0. for i in nums]\\n        \\n        tree = BST()\\n        for i in range(k):\\n            tree.insert(nums[i])\\n        \\n        result = []\\n        for i in range(k, len(nums)):\\n            result.append(tree.find_median())\\n            tree.delete(nums[i-k])\\n            tree.insert(nums[i])\\n        result.append(tree.find_median())\\n        # print result\\n        return result\\n```",

Discard elements that are out of current window.\\n\\nUnfortunately, priority_queue in C++ doesn\\'t allow effecient O(log n) deletion, so we will use sets as heaps.\\nwe can get max element of max heap using *(maxh.rbegin()) and min element of min heap using *(minh.begin())\\n\\nIn order to handle duplicates, we can use a pair of {number, index} instead of just number, this has an added advantage because pairs are by default evaluated by first value in C++, so there is no need to write a custom comparator like in a lot of other answers.\\n\\nCode: \\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<double> medianSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {\\n        set<pair<int, int>> maxh; // get max element using *(maxh.rbegin());\\n        set<pair<int, int>> minh; // get min element using *(minh.begin());\\n        \\n        for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\\n            maxh.insert({nums[i], i}); // a {number, index} pair will always be unique (for handling duplicates)\\n        }\\n        \\n        for(int i = 0; i < k/2; i++) {\\n            minh.insert(*maxh.rbegin());\\n            maxh.erase(*maxh.rbegin());\\n        }\\n        \\n        vector<double> res;\\n        \\n        int n = nums.size();\\n        \\n        for(int i = k; i < n; i++) {\\n            if(k % 2 == 0) {\\n                res.push_back(((double)(maxh.rbegin())->first + (double)(minh.begin())->first) / 2.0);\\n            } else {\\n                res.push_back((double) (maxh.rbegin())->first);\\n            }\\n            \\n            // delete the element that is out of window, deletion in O(log k)\\n            \\n            if(maxh.find({nums[i-k], i-k}) != maxh.end()) {\\n                maxh.erase({nums[i-k], i-k});\\n            }\\n            \\n            if(minh.find({nums[i-k], i-k}) != minh.end()) {\\n                minh.erase({nums[i-k], i-k});\\n            }\\n            \\n            // insert new element\\n            \\n            if(maxh.size() == 0 || nums[i] <= (maxh.rbegin())->first) {\\n                maxh.insert({nums[i], i});\\n            } else {\\n                minh.insert({nums[i], i});\\n            }\\n            \\n            // balance the sets/heaps\\n            \\n            if(minh.size() > maxh.size()) {\\n                pair<int, int> x = *(minh.begin());\\n                minh.erase(x);\\n                maxh.insert(x);\\n            }\\n            \\n            // maxh can have at max one more element than minh\\n            \\n            if(maxh.size() > minh.size()+1) {\\n                pair<int, int> x = *(maxh.rbegin());\\n                maxh.erase(x);\\n                minh.insert(x);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        if(k % 2 == 0) {\\n            res.push_back(((double)(maxh.rbegin())->first + (double)(minh.begin())->first) / 2.0);\\n        } else {\\n            res.push_back((double) (maxh.rbegin())->first);\\n        }\\n        \\n        return res;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```",

Eventually the array is sorted and median calculated.\\n\\nIn Python solution  steps with searching index of passed element, delete it by index, adding new element, sorting array implemented by sortedcontainers library wich reprents SortedList datastrucure.\\n\\n[Thanks DrFirestream for his post.](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-median/discuss/475140/Python-SortedList-solution)\\n\\n![Sliding window with static size of k.](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/user9697n/image_1582050334.png)\\n\\nRuby:\\n```Ruby\\n# 480.

If the size of the list is even, median is the mean of the two middle value, i.e., `the mean of the minimum of the bigger half and the maximum of the smaller half`. **PriorityQueue** is designed for the case that we need to find the minimum or the maximum of a collection from time to time.\\nSo we maintain `minPQ`, the bigger half, and `maxPQ`, the smaller half. And we decide to make the maxPQ larger if needed. The size of minPQ and maxPQ can only differ by 1, that is matained within the `addNumber()`.\\nTo avoid the Integer Overflow, we use `Long` rather than `Integer`.\\n\\n**Code**\\n```\\n    private static PriorityQueue<Long> minPQ;\\n    private static PriorityQueue<Long> maxPQ;\\n    \\n    public double[] medianSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {\\n        \\n        minPQ = new PriorityQueue<>(); // minPQ, pop min, which maintains bigger half\\n        maxPQ = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder()); // maxPQ, pop max, which maintains smaller half\\n        double[] result = new double[nums.length - k + 1];\\n        \\n        int i = 0;\\n        while (i < nums.length) {                      \\n            \\n            if (i <= k - 1) {\\n                addNumber(nums[i]);\\n                if (i == k - 1)\\n                    result[i - k + 1] = getMedian();\\n                i++;\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n            \\n            if (!minPQ.isEmpty() && minPQ.contains((long)nums[i - k])) {\\n                minPQ.remove((long)(nums[i - k]));\\n            }\\n            else if (!maxPQ.isEmpty() && maxPQ.contains((long)nums[i - k])) {\\n                maxPQ.remove((long)(nums[i - k]));\\n            }\\n            \\n            addNumber(nums[i]);            \\n            result[i - k + 1] = getMedian();\\n            i++;           \\n        }\\n        \\n        return result;\\n    }\\n    \\n    private static double getMedian() {\\n        return (maxPQ.size() > minPQ.size()) ? maxPQ.peek() : ((minPQ.peek() + maxPQ.peek()) / 2.0);\\n    }\\n    \\n    private static void addNumber(long num) {\\n        maxPQ.add(num);  \\n        minPQ.add(maxPQ.remove()); \\n        if (minPQ.size() > maxPQ.size()) {\\n            maxPQ.add(minPQ.remove());\\n        }        \\n    }\\n```\\n**I appreciate your VOTE UP (\\u25B0\\u2579\\u25E1\\u2579\\u25B0)**",

                "content": "Intuition:\\nThe problem asks for the median of each sliding window of size k in an input array. One approach to solving this problem is to maintain a sorted list of the elements in the current window, and compute the median from this list. To slide the window, we remove the leftmost element and insert the rightmost element in its correct position in the list.\\n\\nApproach:\\nThe approach used in the code is as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize an empty list with the first k elements of the input array, sorted in increasing order.\\n2. Compute the median of the first window and store it in the result array.\\n3. Slide the window one element at a time, removing the leftmost element and inserting the rightmost element in the list in its correct position.\\n4. Compute the median of the current window and store it in the result array.\\n\\nComplexity:\\nThe time and space complexity of the sliding window median algorithm depend on the size of the input array and the size of the sliding window. Let n be the length of the input array and k be the size of the sliding window.\\n\\nTime complexity: The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log k), where the dominant factor is the time it takes to maintain the sorted list of size k. The insertion and removal of elements in the list take O(log k) time, and we do this n-k+1 times for each window, resulting in a total time complexity of O((n-k+1) log k).\\n\\nSpace complexity: The space complexity of the algorithm is O(k), which is the size of the sorted list we maintain. We also need O(n-k+1) space to store the result array, resulting in a total space complexity of O(n-k+1 + k) = O(n).\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public double[] MedianSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {\\n        int n = nums.Length;\\n        double[] res = new double[n - k + 1];\\n        List<int> list = new List<int>(nums.Take(k).OrderBy(x => x));\\n        res[0] = k % 2 == 0 ?\\n            ((double)list[k / 2 - 1] + (double)list[k / 2]) / 2 :\\n            (double)list[k / 2];\\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n - k; i++) {\\n            int left = nums[i - 1];\\n            int right = nums[i + k - 1];\\n            list.Remove(left);\\n            int j = list.BinarySearch(right);\\n            if (j < 0) j = ~j;\\n            list.Insert(j, right);\\n            res[i] = k % 2 == 0 ?\\n                ((double)list[k / 2 - 1] + (double)list[k / 2]) / 2 :\\n                (double)list[k / 2];\\n        }\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```",
