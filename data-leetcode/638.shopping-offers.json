                "content": "***Upvote if Found Helpful***\\n\\n**Alternate O(n) Space Approach :**\\n\\nWe can easily calculate the number of candy needed by using an array to store the candy of each child. And after that traverse the rating array twice. The first loop makes sure children with a higher rating get more candy than its left neighbor, the second loop makes sure children with a higher rating get more candy than its right neighbor. At last add the total number of candies. This approach is O(n) time and O(n) space. This type of solutions are available in other posts.\\n\\n# **O(1) Space Approach :**\\n\\nWe can consider this problem like valley and peak problem. In each valley there should be 1 candy and for each increasing solpe in either side we need to increse candy by 1. Peaks have highest candy. If any equal rating is found then candy resets to 1 as two equal neighbours may have any number of candies. The peak should contain the higher number of candy between which is calculated from the incresing slope and which is calculated from decreasing slope. Because this will satisfy the condition that peak element is having more candies than its neighbours. \\n\\n***Example :***\\n\\n```\\nLet take the Rating as : [1,3,6,8,9,5,3,6,8,5,4,2,2,3,7,7,9,8,6,6,6,4,2]\\n\\nEach child represented as rating(candy he is given)\\nPeak = max(peak, valley)\\n\\nSee when peak is encountered we take max of the peak calculated from left and valley calculated from right.\\nWhen we get any equal element it gets reset to 1 candy or if it is peak we take max(0, right valley)\\n\\n           (5)         (4)                         (3)\\n            9           8                           9\\n           /|\\\\         /|\\\\                         /|\\\\\\n          / | \\\\       / | \\\\                (3)    / | \\\\\\n      (4)8  |  5(2)  6  |  5(3)             7 __ 7  |  8(2)\\n        /   |   \\\\   (2) |   \\\\              /|   (1) |   \\\\\\n       /    |    \\\\ /    |    \\\\            / |    |  |    \\\\         (3)\\n   (3)6     |     3     |     4(2)       3(2)    |  |     6 __ 6 __ 6    -> Total candy = 50\\n     /      |    (1)    |      \\\\        /   | Reset |    (1)  (1)   |\\\\\\n    /       |           |       \\\\      /    |  to 1 |          |    | \\\\\\n(2)3        |           |        2 __ 2     |       |          |    |  4(2)\\n  /         |           |       (1)  (1)    |       |        Reset  |   \\\\\\n /          |           |                   |       |         to 1  |    \\\\\\n1(1)        |           |                   |       |               |     2(1)\\n   Peak= max(5,3)  Peak= max(3,4)    Peak= max(3,0) |         Peak= max(0,3)\\n                                               Peak= max(2,3)   \\n```\\n\\n**Implementation :**\\n\\n* So we take initially n candy for n children. Then we start traversing the rating array from the second element. If we find equal elements we continue to next element as they already have 1 candy.\\n\\n* If an increasing slop is found `(ratings[i] > ratings [i-1])` we increase value of peak and and add the peak value to candy. After each iteration new peak is found and the value is added to candy. In this way we also get the value of minimum height of the peak at the end.\\n\\n* If a decreasing slope is found `(ratings[i] < ratings [i-1])` we calculate the depth of the valley which is in turn the minimum height of the previous peak. In each iteration we increse the valley by 1 and add it to the candy. You can visualise it as 1 candy is added to each of the previous members untill peak or the new peak value is interted at the previous peak and other values are shifted to right by 1 place. We also need to check if it is going out of array if so then return the number of candy.\\n\\n* After this we can see we have added the peak value twice in candy once as peak and once as valley. But we need only the max value out of these two so we substract the `min(peak, valley)` from candy. \\n\\n* After that return the candy.\\n\\n**Note :** We have considered the sequence increasing -> decreasing as peak should have the max value between the height of left (increasing) side and height of right (decreasing) side. In case of decresing -> increasing we dont need to give special attention as the vallley will always have 1 candy and in our code in this case peak will have 0 value so nothing will be substracted from the candy in the end of iteration.\\n\\nSee the example for better understanding :\\n\\n```\\nIn our code we increase the peak and add peak value untill we get the minimum actual peak.\\nIn case of the decreasing part take this example.\\n\\n[7,5,3,2], initial candy = 4, In each iteration valley++ and candy += valley\\n\\n7 starting (valley = 0, candy = 4, candy configuaration  = [1,1,1,1])\\n \\\\\\n  5 (valley = 1, candy = 4+1 = 5, candy configuaration  = [2,1,1,1])\\n   \\\\\\n    3 (valley = 2, candy = 5+2 = 7, candy configuaration = [3,2,1,1])\\n     \\\\\\n      2 [valley = 3, candy = 7+3 = 10, candy configuartion = [4,3,2,1])\\n\\t  \\nHere see the valley is at last equal to the minimum previous peak value.\\n\\nAs we have given 1 candy to all before so the peak and valley values are actually 1 less than the actual candy they should get.\\n```\\n\\n**Code :**\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n        int n = ratings.size();\\n        int candy = n, i=1;\\n        while(i<n){\\n            if(ratings[i] == ratings[i-1]){\\n                i++;\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n            \\n            //For increasing slope\\n            int peak = 0;\\n            while(ratings[i] > ratings [i-1]){\\n                peak++;\\n                candy += peak;\\n                i++;\\n                if(i == n) return candy;\\n            }\\n            \\n            //For decreasing slope\\n            int valley = 0;\\n            while(i<n && ratings[i] < ratings[i-1]){\\n                valley++;\\n                candy += valley;\\n                i++;\\n            }\\n            candy -= min(peak, valley); //Keep only the higher peak\\n        }\\n        return candy;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Welcome back to another exciting coding session. Today\\'s problem is a treat\\u2014literally! We\\'re going to solve the \"Candy\" problem. Imagine you have a bunch of kids lined up, each with a rating assigned to them. Your task is to distribute candies to these kids following two simple rules:\\n\\n1. Every child must get at least one candy.\\n2. A child with a higher rating should get more candies than their immediate neighbors.\\n\\nSounds like a piece of cake, right? But here\\'s the twist: you need to accomplish this with the fewest candies possible. Let\\'s dig into the mechanics of this problem and how to approach it.\\n\\n## Key Concepts and Constraints\\n\\n### Why is This Problem Unique?\\n\\n1. **Child Ratings**: \\n   The ratings of each child are your only guide in how you distribute the candies. Following the rules while using these ratings makes this problem an intriguing puzzle.\\n  \\n2. **Minimum Candies**: \\n   You\\'re not just distributing candies willy-nilly; the goal is to meet the conditions using the least amount of candy.\\n\\n3. **Constraints**: \\n   - The length of the ratings array, `n` , is between  $$1$$  and $$ 2 \\\\times 10^4 $$.\\n   - Ratings are integers between $$0$$ and $$ 2 \\\\times 10^4 $$.\\n\\n### Strategies to Tackle the Problem\\n\\n1. **Greedy Algorithm: Two-Pass Method**  \\n   This method takes two passes through the ratings array to ensure that each child gets the appropriate amount of candy.\\n\\n2. **One-Pass Greedy Algorithm: Up-Down-Peak Method**  \\n   This more advanced method uses a single pass and employs three key variables\\u2014Up, Down, and Peak\\u2014to efficiently determine the minimum number of candies needed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Live Coding + Explenation of Greedy Two Pass\\nhttps://youtu.be/JqrZHuhljps?si=TxkUjNTZ1CxMviij\\n\\n## Greedy Algorithm: Two-Pass Method Explained\\n\\n### What is a Greedy Algorithm?\\n\\nA Greedy Algorithm makes choices that seem optimal at the moment. For this problem, we use a two-pass greedy approach to make sure each child gets the minimum number of candies that still satisfy the conditions.\\n\\n### The Nuts and Bolts of the Two-Pass Method\\n\\n1. **Initialize Candies Array**  \\n   - We start by creating a `candies` array of the same length as the `ratings` array and initialize all its values to 1. This is the base case and ensures that every child will receive at least one candy, satisfying the first condition.\\n  \\n2. **Forward Pass: Left to Right**\\n   - Now, we iterate through the `ratings` array from the beginning to the end. For each child (except the first), we compare their rating with the one to the left. If it\\'s higher, we update the `candies` array for that child to be one more than the child on the left. This takes care of the second condition but only accounts for the child\\'s left neighbor.\\n   \\n3. **Backward Pass: Right to Left**  \\n   - After the forward pass, we loop through the array again but in the reverse direction. This time, we compare each child\\'s rating with the child to their right. If the rating is higher, we need to make sure the child has more candies than the right neighbor. So, we update the `candies` array for that child to be the maximum between its current number of candies and one more than the right neighbor\\'s candies. This ensures that both neighboring conditions are checked and satisfied.\\n   \\n4. **Summing it All Up**\\n   - Finally, we sum up all the values in the `candies` array. This will give us the minimum total number of candies that need to be distributed to satisfy both conditions.\\n  \\n### Time and Space Complexity\\n\\n- **Time Complexity**: $$O(n)$$, because we make two passes through the array.\\n- **Space Complexity**: $$O(n)$$, for storing the `candies` array.\\n\\n## Code Greedy\\n``` Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:\\n        n = len(ratings)\\n        candies = [1] * n \\n\\n        for i in range(1, n):\\n            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:\\n                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1\\n\\n        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\\n            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:\\n                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i+1] + 1)\\n        \\n        return sum(candies)\\n```\\n``` Go []\\nfunc candy(ratings []int) int {\\n    n := len(ratings)\\n    candies := make([]int, n)\\n    for i := range candies {\\n        candies[i] = 1\\n    }\\n\\n    for i := 1;

They serve as counters for the following:\\n\\n- **`Up`:** Counts how many children have **increasing ratings** from the last child. This helps us determine how many candies we need for a child with a higher rating than the previous child.\\n  \\n- **`Down`:** Counts how many children have **decreasing ratings** from the last child. This helps us determine how many candies we need for a child with a lower rating than the previous child.\\n\\n- **`Peak`:** Keeps track of the **last highest point** in an increasing sequence. When we have a decreasing sequence after the peak, we can refer back to the `Peak` to adjust the number of candies if needed.\\n\\n### How Does it Work?\\n\\n1. **Initialize Your Counters**\\n   - Start with `ret = 1` because each child must have at least one candy. Initialize `up`, `down`, and `peak` to 0.\\n   \\n2. **Loop Through Ratings**\\n   - For each pair of adjacent children, compare their ratings. Here are the scenarios:\\n   \\n     - **If the rating is increasing**: Update `up` and `peak` by incrementing them by 1. Set `down` to 0. Add `up + 1` to `ret` because the current child must have one more candy than the previous child.\\n     \\n     - **If the rating is the same**: Reset `up`, `down`, and `peak` to 0, because neither an increasing nor a decreasing trend is maintained. Add 1 to `ret` because the current child must have at least one candy.\\n     \\n     - **If the rating is decreasing**: Update `down` by incrementing it by 1. Reset `up` to 0. Add `down` to `ret`. Additionally, if `peak` is greater than or equal to `down`, decrement `ret` by 1. This is because the peak child can share the same number of candies as one of the children in the decreasing sequence, which allows us to reduce the total number of candies.\\n  \\n3. **Return the Total Candy Count**\\n   - At the end of the loop, `ret` will contain the minimum total number of candies needed for all the children, so return `ret`.\\n\\nBy using `up`, `down`, and `peak`, we can efficiently traverse the ratings list just once, updating our total candies count (`ret`) as we go. This method is efficient and helps us solve the problem in a single pass, with a time complexity of $$O(n)$$.\\n### Time and Space Complexity\\n\\n- **Time Complexity**: $$O(n)$$, for the single pass through the ratings array.\\n- **Space Complexity**: $$O(1)$$, as we only use a few extra variables.\\n\\n## Code One-Pass Greedy\\n``` Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:\\n        if not ratings:\\n            return 0\\n        \\n        ret, up, down, peak = 1, 0, 0, 0\\n        \\n        for prev, curr in zip(ratings[:-1], ratings[1:]):\\n            if prev < curr:\\n                up, down, peak = up + 1, 0, up + 1\\n                ret += 1 + up\\n            elif prev == curr:\\n                up = down = peak = 0\\n                ret += 1\\n            else:\\n                up, down = 0, down + 1\\n                ret += 1 + down - int(peak >= down)\\n        \\n        return ret\\n\\n```\\n``` Go []\\nfunc candy(ratings []int) int {\\n    if len(ratings) == 0 {\\n        return 0\\n    }\\n\\n    ret, up, down, peak := 1, 0, 0, 0\\n\\n    for i := 0; i < len(ratings) - 1; i++ {\\n        prev, curr := ratings[i], ratings[i+1]\\n\\n        if prev < curr {\\n            up++\\n            down = 0\\n            peak = up\\n            ret += 1 + up\\n        } else if prev == curr {\\n            up, down, peak = 0, 0, 0\\n            ret += 1\\n        } else {\\n            up = 0\\n            down++\\n            ret += 1 + down\\n            if peak >= down {\\n                ret--\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    return ret\\n}\\n```\\n``` Rust []\\nimpl Solution {\\n    pub fn candy(ratings: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {\\n        if ratings.is_empty() {\\n            return 0;\\n        }\\n\\n        let mut ret = 1;\\n        let mut up = 0;\\n        let mut down = 0;\\n        let mut peak = 0;\\n\\n        for i in 0..ratings.len() - 1 {\\n            let (prev, curr) = (ratings[i], ratings[i + 1]);\\n\\n            if prev < curr {\\n                up += 1;\\n                down = 0;\\n                peak = up;\\n                ret += 1 + up;\\n            } else if prev == curr {\\n                up = 0;\\n                down = 0;\\n                peak = 0;\\n                ret += 1;\\n            } else {\\n                up = 0;\\n                down += 1;\\n                ret += 1 + down;\\n                if peak >= down {\\n                    ret -= 1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        ret\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Performance Comparison\\n\\n| Language  | Approach  | Time (ms)  | Memory (MB) |\\n|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|\\n| Rust      | One Pass  | 1          | 2.1         |\\n| Rust      | Two Pass  | 2          | 2.3         |\\n| Java      | Two Pass  | 3          | 44.3        |\\n| Go        | One Pass  | 9          | 6.2         |\\n| C++       | Two Pass  | 11         | 17.8        |\\n| Go        | Two Pass  | 14         | 6.6         |\\n| PHP       | Two Pass  | 42         | 21.9        |\\n| JavaScript| Two Pass  | 59         | 45.1        |\\n| C#        | Two Pass  | 98         | 44.3        |\\n| Python3   | One Pass  | 126        | 19.5        |\\n| Python3   | Two Pass  | 139        | 19.2        |\\n\\n![h2.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/098d38e8-c14e-48b3-9c98-3394eb56d996_1694566150.8876379.png)\\n\\n## Live Coding & Explenation - One Pass\\nhttps://youtu.be/_MVFeqfiDK4?si=t8El9b9mlUQneXDk\\n\\n## Code Highlights and Best Practices\\n\\n- The Two-Pass Greedy Algorithm is straightforward and effective, making it a solid approach for this problem.\\n- The One-Pass Greedy Algorithm is even more efficient in terms of space complexity and is also a bit more challenging to understand.\\n  \\nBy mastering these approaches, you\\'ll be well-equipped to tackle other optimization problems, which are common in coding interviews and competitive programming.

His/her rating is equal to the previous one -> give 1 candy.\\n 2. His/her rating is greater than the previous one -> give him (previous + 1) candies.\\n 3. His/her rating is less than the previous one -> don't know what to do yet, let's just count the number of such consequent cases.\\n \\nWhen we enter 1 or 2 condition we can check our count from 3. If it's not zero then we know that we were descending before and we have everything to update our total candies amount: number of children in descending sequence of raitings - coundDown, number of candies given at peak - prev (we don't update prev when descending). Total number of candies for \"descending\" children can be found through arithmetic progression formula (1+2+...+countDown). Plus we need to update our peak child if his number of candies is less then or equal to countDown. \\n\\nHere's a pretty concise code below.\\n\\n----------\\n\\n    public class Solution {\\n        public int candy(int[] ratings) {\\n            if (ratings == null || ratings.length == 0) return 0;\\n            int total = 1, prev = 1, countDown = 0;\\n            for (int i = 1; i < ratings.length; i++) {\\n                if (ratings[i] >= ratings[i-1]) {\\n                    if (countDown > 0) {\\n                        total += countDown*(countDown+1)/2; // arithmetic progression\\n                        if (countDown >= prev) total += countDown - prev + 1;\\n                        countDown = 0;\\n                        prev = 1;\\n                    }\\n                    prev = ratings[i] == ratings[i-1] ? 1 : prev+1;\\n                    total += prev;\\n                } else countDown++;\\n            }\\n            if (countDown > 0) { // if we were descending at the end\\n                total += countDown*(countDown+1)/2;\\n                if (countDown >= prev) total += countDown - prev + 1;\\n            }\\n            return total;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\nHave a nice coding!",

                "content": "# Problem Description\\nThe task is distributing candies to a group of `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a **rating value**, represented as an **integer** array called `ratings`.\\n\\nFollow **two specific requirements** while distributing the candies:\\n- Each child must have at least one candy.\\n- Children with a higher rating should receive more candies than their neighbors.\\n\\nThe **goal** is to determine the **minimum** number of candies needed to satisfy these requirements and distribute the candies to the children accordingly.\\n\\n- **Constraints:**\\n    - `n == ratings.length`\\n    - `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`\\n    - `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`\\n    - at **least one candy** for each child\\n    - neighbours with **higher rating** have **more candies**\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n# Intuition\\nHi there\\uD83D\\uDE00\\nLet\\'s take a look on this interesting problem.\\n\\nFor our candies task we have **two crucial requirements**: Each child must have **at least one** candy, and children with **higher ratings** than their **neighbors** have more candies than them... Interesting.\\n\\nLet\\'s explore some ratings\\' cases together:\\n\\n\\n```\\n2, 2, 2 \\n```\\nHere we can see that **each child** of them can have **one candy** since no one has higher rating than its neighbor.\\n\\n```\\n1, 2, 2, 2 \\n```\\nHere we can see that the array of candies will be `1, 2, 1, 1`.\\n\\n```\\n9, 8, 7\\n```\\nHere we can see that array of candies will be `3, 2, 1`.\\n\\n```\\n7, 8, 9\\n```\\nHere we can see that array of candies will be `1, 2, 3`.\\n\\n\\nI think now we have some **idea** about what is going on here\\uD83E\\uDD14\\n- Children with **equal ratings** can have different candies and that won\\'t violate our requirements since we are aiming for giving **minimum** candies.\\n- We must take care of **decreasing** subarrays and **increasing** ones.\\n\\nHow can we use an approach that take care of these **observations**?\\uD83D\\uDE80\\n\\n## Two Pass Approach \\nIn this approach we will:\\n- Iterate from `left to right` to take care of **increasing** subarrays \\n- Iterate from `right to left` to take care of **decreasing** subarrays\\n- We **won\\'t do anything** to **equal** neighbours since they won\\'t affect our requirements\\n\\nLet\\'s take an example:\\n```\\n9, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8, 9\\n```\\n**First** we have array of candes `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`\\n\\nAfter our **first pass** (from left to right) we will have array of candies `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3`.\\nWe can see that it **handled** the **increasing** subarray perfectly.\\n\\nAfter our **second pass**(from right to left) we will have array of candies `2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3 `.\\nwe can see that it also **handled** the **decreasing** subarray perfectly.\\n\\nAlso, it handled the equal neighbours after the two passes. It finally minimized our candies. \\n\\n\\n## One Pass Approach \\nThis solution is more challenging since it requires us to handle the **three cases** in **one** pass. How can we start? \\uD83E\\uDD14\\nWe saw before that we have three cases **increasing** subarrays,  **decreasing** subarrays and **equal** subbarrays.\\nWe can start by intialize **three variables** to handle the three of them.\\n\\nFor **increasing** subarray we need one variable `up` to handle what candy we give to current child.\\nfor each child in the **increasing** subarray increase the `up` variable by one and give the current child `up + 1` candies indicating that it must have more that the child before him\\nwe will call `up + 1` as `peak` to mean the highest child in our subarray\\n\\nFor **equal** subarrays, only give them `one` candy and we will see that we only give one to the children in the middle of the subarray\\n\\nFor **decreasing** subarray here comes the challenge \\nWe will introduce variable like first case called `down` but the purpose of it **not** indicating that we give candies to current child but, giving **one** candy to current child and **one** candy for each child before him in the decreasing subarray to meet the requirements.\\n\\nExample : `1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1`\\n![1.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/a99e9752-25cb-46f7-8d18-364b17088f96_1694573615.3577487.jpeg)\\n\\nBut what if we have **increasing** then **decreasing** subarrays?\\nWe will have the **last** child of the first subarray as first child on the second and then we give each child in the decreasing subarray one candy except that child who is our `peak` until the length of the subarray is larger than the `peak`.\\n\\nExample : `1, 2, 3, 2, 1`\\n![2.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/53bc278c-a910-47a6-846c-d8d85461c79c_1694573659.6552763.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n## Two Pass Approach\\n### Steps\\n- **Initialize** variables:\\n    - `n` is number of children.\\n    - `candies` to store candies for each child..\\n- **First Pass** (Left to Right):\\n    - For each child, **check** if the previous child has a **lower** rating and has **more** or **equal** candies.\\n    - If **true**, give the current child one more candy than the previous child.\\n- **Second Pass** (Right to Left):\\n    - For each child, **check** if the next child has a **lower** rating and has **more** or **equal** candies.\\n    - If **true**, give the current child one more candy than the next child.\\n    \\n- Calculate and return totalCandies.\\n\\n### Complexity\\n- **Time complexity:** $$O(N)$$\\nSince we are looping over the ratings array twice then the time complexity is `2*N` which is `O(N)`.\\n- **Space complexity:** $$O(N)$$\\nSince we are storing the number of candies for each child then the space complexity is `O(N)`.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## One Pass Approach\\n### Steps\\n- **Initialize** variables:\\n    - `n` to store the number of children.\\n    - `upCount` to keep track of consecutive increasing ratings.\\n    - `downCount` to keep track of consecutive decreasing ratings.\\n    - `peakCount` to store the number of candies at the peak of increasing ratings.\\n    - `totalCandies` to count required candies.\\n- **Iterate** Through Ratings:\\n    - **compare** the child rating with the **previous** child\\n    - If current child has a **higher** rating than previous one then update the variables and add `peakCount` to `totalCandies`.\\n    - If current child has the **same** rating as previous one then update and add `1` to ``totalCandies``.\\n    - If current child has a **lower** rating than previous one update and update `totalCandies` by adding `downCount` + 1, subtracting `1` if `peakCount` is greater than `downCount`.\\n- **Return** `totalCandies`\\n\\n### Complexity\\n- **Time complexity:** $$O(N)$$\\nSince we are looping over the ratings array one time then the time complexity is `N` which is `O(N)`.\\n- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$\\nSince we are storing only couple of variables then the space complexity is `O(1)`.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n## Two Pass Approach\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n        int n = ratings.size();

                "content": "The question requires us to make sure a child with a higher rate has more candies than its left and right neighbors. One simple solution is to do two scans: one foward scan (from 1 to N-1) to make sure child i has more candies than its left neighbor if its rate is higher than its left neighbor. After the forward scan, we can guarantee that the left neighbor relationship is correct but we have to do more to make the right neighbor relationship in order; so we do the backwarad scan (from N-2 to 0) to make child i has more candies than its right neighbor i+1 if its rate is higher than its right neighbor. In the following implementation, we need a O(N) array number to save the number of candies needed for children, so it has O(N) space complexity and we do two linear scans so the time complexity is O(N) \\n\\n    class Solution {\\n    public:\\n        int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n            int len = ratings.size(), res = 0, i;\\n            if(len>0)\\n            {\\n                vector<int> number(len,0); // to save the number of candies for child[0:N-1]\\n                number[0] = 1; \\n    // forward scan to calculate how many candies needed for child i to make sure it has more candies than its left neighbor if it has a higher rate, otherwise, give one candy to it\\n                for(i=1; i<len;++i) number[i] = ratings[i]>ratings[i-1]?number[i-1]+1:1;\\n    \\n    // backward scan to calculate to make sure child i has more candies than its right neighbor if it has a higher rate, pick the bigger one from forward and backward scans as the final number for child i\\n                for(i=len-2, res = number[len-1]; i>=0;--i)\\n                {\\n                    if( (ratings[i]>ratings[i+1]) && number[i]<(number[i+1]+1) ) number[i] = number[i+1]+1;\\n                    res += number[i];\\n                }\\n            }\\n            return res;\\n        }\\n    };\\n\\nNow, the question is can we do better? Do we really need two scans? If we do only forward scan, then the problem is we can not guarantee the right neighbor relationship holds. i.e. we don't know if the following order is descending (i>i+1>i+2>...). and that may cause issues. To fix that, we will detect the dips (the points at which the order switchs from increasing to decreasng). We will make sure all the local dips (minimum points) has only one candy and update its previous neighbors (which has hgher rates than its rate) accordingly. To do such update, we need to know when the decrease starts, so we use pPos to save that starting points. \\nSo the solution becomes: do the forward scan, if it is in an increasing order (child i rate > child i-1 order), check if it is a local dip (neg_peak == true): if so, update the candy number to make sure child i-1 has one candy. if not, just give one more candy to child i. If it is in an decreasing order (child i rate < child i-1 order)\\n, just give one less candy to i. don't forget at last, we still need to make sure child N-1 has one or more candy. So O(1) space , O(N) time\\n\\n        class Solution {\\n        public:\\n            int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n                const int len = ratings.size();\\n                if(len<=1) return len;\\n                \\n                int i, pPos, res=1, peak=1; // peak: # candies given to the i-1 child\\n                bool neg_peak = false; // flag to indicate if it is a local dip\\n                for(i=1; i<len;i++)\\n                {\\n                    if(ratings[i] >= ratings[i-1]) \\n                    {   // it is increasing\\n                        if(neg_peak) \\n                        {  // it is a local dip, we need to make sure i-1 has one candy\\n                            res -= (peak-1) * (i-pPos - (peak>0));\\n                            peak = 1;\\n                            neg_peak = false;\\n                        }\\n                       // update child i candy number, if equal, set to 1\\n                        peak = (ratings[i] == ratings[i-1])? 1:++peak;\\n                        res += peak;\\n                    }\\n                    else\\n                    { // decreasing, just give one less candy, if it is the starting point of a decrease, update pPos\\n                        if(!neg_peak) {pPos = i-1; neg_peak = true;}\\n                        res += --peak;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n    // don't forget to update res, if the last one is a local dip\\n                return !neg_peak? res : res - (peak-1) * (i-pPos - (peak>0));\\n        \\n            }\\n        };",

So for the first mountain \"a\" slope is\\n \\n    L(a)=4    ==>  4+3+2+1 candies \\n\\nand \"b\" is \\n\\n    L(b)=3 ==> 3+2+1 candies\\n\\nPeak is \\n\\n    max(L(a),L(b)) + 1 ==>5 candies.\\n         \\n\\n Unfortunately we can know the longer side of the mountain at the end of the mountain only.\\n\\n So we use \"up\" and \"down\" variable to track the length of the slopes. We sum the candies \\n at the end of each mountain and then we reset the slopes to zero.\\n\\n Special case: we have same rating twice (land). This ends a mountain even if it was ascending \\n (that means: descending slope of length = 0)\\n\\n And to make things more complicated, the last element of a sequence \\n is also the beginning of the next sequence (another mountain or land),\\n so we take that into account.\\n\\n\\n    class Solution {\\n    public:\\n        // Candies for a slope of n elements\\n        int slope(int n)\\n        {\\n            return (n*(n+1))/2;\\n        }\\n    \\n        int candy(vector<int> &ratings) {\\n            if (ratings.size() <= 1 )\\n            {\\n                return ratings.size();\\n            }\\n            int tot = 0;        // The final amount of candies\\n            int up = 0;         // Lenght of the last ascending slope\\n            int down = 0;       // Lenght of the last descending slope\\n            int oldsign = 0;    // Previous ratings trend (1 = ascending, -1 == descending, 0 = stable) \\n    \\n            for (int i = 1; i< ratings.size(); i++)\\n            {\\n                            // Current ratings trend, same meaning as oldsign\\n                int newsign = ratings[i] > ratings[i-1] ? 1 : \\n                              ratings[i] < ratings[i-1] ? -1 : 0;\\n                            // We can calculate the contribution of a slope \\n                            // when that slope ends and it's not the peak of a mountain,\\n                            // that's why we have \"newsign == 0\" and not \"newsign <= 0\"\\n                if ((oldsign > 0 && newsign == 0)  ||\\n                    (oldsign < 0  && newsign >= 0) )\\n                    {\\n                            // The peak of the mountain should have max(up,down)+1\\n                            // candies, but the end of the mountain is the beginning of\\n                            // the next sequence, so we don't the candy at the end of \\n                            // the mountain\\n                        tot += slope(up) + slope(down) + std::max(up, down);\\n                        up = 0;\\n                        down = 0;\\n                    }\\n    \\n                if(newsign > 0)\\n                    up++;\\n                if(newsign < 0)\\n                    down++;\\n                        // Same rating of the previous child?\\n                        // Take one candy.If you are better then the next child\\n                        // the descending slope will take that into account, don't worry\\n                if(newsign == 0)\\n                    tot++;\\n                    \\n                oldsign = newsign;\\n            }\\n            \\n                        // Final sequence has to be closed\\n                        // Why +1?

In this case, actually we do the same thing of `case2`. Because even if input is decreasing order `[9,5,3,1]`, we need to give candies to the current `i` child. In the end, total candies are 10 `[4,3,2,1]`. we need some extra candies.\\n\\nAdd `+1` to `current_valley` and add `current_valley` to `total_candies` and incremtnt `i`. this process continues until we don\\'t meet case 3 `while condition` above.\\n\\nLet me explain `current_valley` in \"How it works\" section.\\n\\nIn the last of Step 2, subtract minium of `current_peak` or `current_valley` from `total_candies`.\\n\\n# How it works\\nLet\\'s think with this input. \\n```\\nInput: ratings = [2,4,6,7,3,2,2]\\n```\\n```\\ntotal_candies(Let\\'s say \"total\") = 7 (length of input array)\\ncurrent_peak(Let\\'s say \"peak\") = 0\\ncurrent_valley(Let\\'s say \"valley\") = 0\\n\\n```\\nIn Step2, starting from `index 1`.\\n```\\n\\u25A0 Case2\\ncondtion: while i < n and ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:\\n\\nindex 1 > index 0, so peak = 1, valley = 0, total = 8 (7 + 1)\\nindex 2 > index 1, so peak = 2, valley = 0, total = 10 (8 + 2)\\nindex 3 > index 2, so peak = 3, valley = 0, total = 13 (10 + 3)\\nindex 4 < index 3, then stop Case2\\n\\nOur code distrubtes candies like this so far\\nfrom [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\\nto   [1,2,3,4,1,1,1](total 13 candies)\\n```\\n```\\n\\u25A0 Case3\\ncondtion: while i < n and ratings[i] < ratings[i - 1]:\\n\\nindex 4 < index 3, so peak = 3, valley = 1, total = 14 (13 + 1)\\nindex 5 < index 4, so peak = 3, valley = 2, total = 16 (14 + 2)\\nindex 6 == index 5, then stop Case3\\n\\nOur code distrubtes candies like this so far\\nfrom [1,2,3,4,1,1,1](Case2)\\nto   [1,2,3,4,2,3,1](total 16 candies)\\n```\\n\\nLet me explain `total_candies -= min(current_peak, current_valley)`\\nBefore that, `the last rating(index 6)` is equal to `index 5`, so we don\\'t do anything(meet `Case1`). Let me skip it.\\n\\nNow Look at this. When ratings = `[2,4,6,7,3,2,2]`\\n```\\nThis is real distribution, In other words, the minimum number of\\ncandies you need to have to distribute\\n\\n[1,2,3,4,2,1,1] = 14 candies\\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\\n[0,1,2,3,1,0,0](additional candies for each children)\\n```\\n```\\nHow our code distributes candies\\n\\n[1,2,3,4,2,3,1] = 16 candies\\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\\n[0,1,2,3,1,2,0](additional candies for each children)\\n```\\n\\nCompare distribution of adittional candies.\\n```\\n[0,1,2,3,1,0,0](Real)\\n[0,1,2,3,1,2,0](Our code)\\n```\\nOur code distributes `extra 2 candies` at `index 5` which is equal to minimum of `current_peak` or `current_valley`. That\\'s because actually we add peaks twice as a `peak` and as a `valley` in Case2 and Case3. For this question, we need peak value only once. More precisely, we need only higher peak between range of one of `peak` and `valley` combinations(in this case between `index1` and `index5`), because of constraints from the description saying \"Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors\".\\n\\nThat\\'s why we need to substract `minimum peak` from `total_candies`. In this case `16 - 2`. `peak = 3` vs `valley = 2`\\n\\n```\\nOutput: 14\\n```\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n)\\n\\'n\\' is the number of elements in the \\'ratings\\' list.

One way to approach this is to scan the ratings array from left to right and then from right to left, adjusting the number of candies given based on the rating comparisons.\\n# Approach\\n1. Initialize variables:\\n\\n- 1. \"up_count\" to count increasing ratings sequences (starts at 1).\\n- 2. \"down_count\" to count decreasing ratings sequences (starts at 0).\\n- 3. \"candies_given\" to keep track of the total number of candies given (starts at 1).\\n- 4. \"peak\" to keep track of the peak of increasing ratings (starts at 0).\\n2. Iterate through the ratings list starting from the second element.\\n\\n- 1. If the current rating is greater than the previous one, it\\'s an increasing sequence:\\n- - - Increment up_count.\\n- - - Reset down_count to 0.\\n- - - Increment candies_given by up_count.\\n- - - Update peak to the value of up_count (as this is the peak of the current increasing sequence).\\n- 2. If the current rating is equal to the previous one, reset counts:\\n- - - Reset down_count and peak to 0.\\n- - - Reset up_count to 1.\\n- - - Increment candies_given by 1 (since they have the same rating, they should have the same number of candies).\\n- 3. If the current rating is less than the previous one, it\\'s a decreasing sequence:\\n- - - Increment down_count.\\n- - - Reset up_count to 1.\\n- - - Increment candies_given by down_count.\\n- - - If the current down_count is greater than or equal to peak, give an extra candy to the child at the peak of the decreasing sequence.\\n3. Return candies_given, which represents the minimum number of candies given to satisfy the conditions\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time Complexity: $$O(n)$$ - We iterate through the ratings array twice, once from left to right and once from right to left.\\n- Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$ - We use a constant amount of extra space for variables.\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n# Python\\n```\\n# Define a class named Solution.\\nclass Solution:\\n    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:\\n        up_count = 1  # Initialize a variable to count increasing ratings sequences.\\n        down_count = 0  # Initialize a variable to count decreasing ratings sequences.\\n        candies_given = 1  # Initialize the total count of candies given, starting with one.\\n        peak = 0  # Initialize a variable to keep track of the peak of increasing ratings.\\n\\n        # Iterate through the ratings list starting from the second element.\\n        for i in range(1, len(ratings)):\\n            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:\\n                # If the current rating is greater than the previous one, it\\'s an increasing sequence.\\n                up_count += 1\\n                down_count = 0\\n                candies_given += up_count  # Increment the candy count for the current child.\\n                peak = up_count  # Update the peak for the current increasing sequence.\\n            elif ratings[i] == ratings[i - 1]:\\n                # If the current rating is equal to the previous one, reset counts.\\n                down_count = 0\\n                peak = 0\\n                up_count = 1\\n                candies_given += 1  # Increment the candy count for the current child (since they have the same rating).\\n            else:\\n                # If the current rating is less than the previous one, it\\'s a decreasing sequence.\\n                down_count += 1\\n                up_count = 1\\n                candies_given += down_count  # Increment the candy count for the current child.\\n                if peak <= down_count:\\n                    candies_given += 1  # Give an extra candy to the child at the peak of the decreasing sequence.\\n\\n        return candies_given  # Return the total number of candies given to all children.\\n\\n          \\n```\\n# JAVA\\n```\\n// Define a class named Solution.\\nclass Solution {\\n    // Define a method named candy.\\n    public int candy(int[] ratings) {\\n        // Check if the ratings array is empty;

                "content": "When we first encounter such problem, the *least* is the keyword here. There are two constraints: \\n\\n - each child will have candy which means at least one candy;\\n - children with higher ratings will have more candies, which means their amount of candies is larger than neighboring children - to the left and to the right;\\n\\nSince the problem is resolved into these two constraints, then it can be easy to be handled now. The basic idea is as follows: \\n\\n -  traverse from the left to the right to determine the minimal amount of candies for each child that is constrained by the left; \\n - traverse from the right to the left and  determine the minimal amount of candies for each child that is constrained by the right;\\n - finally we can get the minimal constrained by both the left and the right neighbors for each child by retrieving the them from the results of the above two. \\n\\nOkay, by now you might be wonder how to determine the minimal constrained by the left or the right; actually it's quite intuitive that suppose we are traversing from the left to the right and set the leftmost child to 1 candy and then \\n\\n - if the next child ratings is higher ratings[i+1]>ratings[i] then **limits[i+1]=limits[i]+1**; \\n - if the next child ratings is equal to the current one ratings[i+1]==ratings[i] then **limits[i+1]=limits[i]**;\\n - if the next child ratings is smaller (ratings[i+1] < ratings[i]) then the child is not constrained by the left now and can be any but we need to reach global minimal so **limits[i]=1**;\\n\\nEach child will be either constrained by the left or the right or both, but since it's constrained by *the higher ratings more candies rule* the minimal can only be achieved by following it; then it's the valid least amount of candies we can reach.\\n\\nMerging the two results into final limits traversing from the left to the right: \\n\\n - if the ratings[i+1] > ratings[i] then obviously limits[i+1] will be determined by the max(limits[i]+1, limits[i]) - the second parameter limits[i] here is the previous traversal (from right to left) result limits[i] constrained by the right. We have to meet the constraints of both side, so we select the higher limit here;\\n - if the ratings[i+] <= ratings[i] then limits[i+1] should be less than limits[i]  determined by the left but limits[i+1] which is determined by the right in the previous traversal (from right to left) is already less then limits[i]; so limits[i+1] in from-right-to-left is the valid minimal value we can get here; \\n\\nSince we have to store the limits for each child either from left to right or from right to left, so space cost will be O(n) but as an optimized option we can reuse it to reduce the space cost from 2*n to n. As for time cost, we are traversing, man! Obviously it will be O(n), to further reduce the time cost we can sum them up at the second traversal to reduce the time cost from 3 traversals to 2 traversals only.\\n\\n - Space cost O(n)\\n - Time cost O(n)\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\n    #define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ?

The basic idea is as follows: \\n\\n -  traverse from the left to the right to determine the minimal amount of candies for each child that is constrained by the left; \\n - traverse from the right to the left and  determine the minimal amount of candies for each child that is constrained by the right;\\n - finally we can get the minimal constrained by both the left and the right neighbors for each child by retrieving the them from the results of the above two. \\n\\nOkay, by now you might be wonder how to determine the minimal constrained by the left or the right; actually it's quite intuitive that suppose we are traversing from the left to the right and set the leftmost child to 1 candy and then \\n\\n - if the next child ratings is higher ratings[i+1]>ratings[i] then **limits[i+1]=limits[i]+1**; \\n - if the next child ratings is equal to the current one ratings[i+1]==ratings[i] then **limits[i+1]=limits[i]**;\\n - if the next child ratings is smaller (ratings[i+1] < ratings[i]) then the child is not constrained by the left now and can be any but we need to reach global minimal so **limits[i]=1**;\\n\\nEach child will be either constrained by the left or the right or both, but since it's constrained by *the higher ratings more candies rule* the minimal can only be achieved by following it; then it's the valid least amount of candies we can reach.\\n\\nMerging the two results into final limits traversing from the left to the right: \\n\\n - if the ratings[i+1] > ratings[i] then obviously limits[i+1] will be determined by the max(limits[i]+1, limits[i]) - the second parameter limits[i] here is the previous traversal (from right to left) result limits[i] constrained by the right. We have to meet the constraints of both side, so we select the higher limit here;\\n - if the ratings[i+] <= ratings[i] then limits[i+1] should be less than limits[i]  determined by the left but limits[i+1] which is determined by the right in the previous traversal (from right to left) is already less then limits[i]; so limits[i+1] in from-right-to-left is the valid minimal value we can get here; \\n\\nSince we have to store the limits for each child either from left to right or from right to left, so space cost will be O(n) but as an optimized option we can reuse it to reduce the space cost from 2*n to n. As for time cost, we are traversing, man! Obviously it will be O(n), to further reduce the time cost we can sum them up at the second traversal to reduce the time cost from 3 traversals to 2 traversals only.\\n\\n - Space cost O(n)\\n - Time cost O(n)\\n\\n\\n----------\\n\\n    #define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ?

For example, if `ratings=[3,6,7,10]`, then we can assign candies `[1,2,3,4]` to minimize the number of candies given. Similarly, for `n` descending ratings, we can assign `n,n-1,...,1` candies.\\n\\nThe only tricky case is when a rating is a \"peak\". In the case `ratings=[1,3,5,4]`, the `5` acts as a peak. Since there\\'s a group of `3` ascending candies before the peak (including the peak itself), we should assign the peak `3` candies, but there\\'s a group of `2` descending candies after the peak (including the peak itself). If this happens, we should assign the peak `max(3,2) = 3` candies to satisfy all conditions.\\n\\nIn the case there\\'s a group with all the same ratings, we can just assign them `1` candy, given that they aren\\'t part of a peak or valley.\\n\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int direction(int x, int y) {\\n        if (x == y) return 0;\\n        return (x > y ? -1 : 1);\\n    }\\n    \\n    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n        int n = ratings.size();\\n        int i = 0, prev = 1;\\n        int ans = 1;\\n        while (i + 1 < n) {\\n            int run = 1, dir = direction(ratings[i], ratings[i + 1]);\\n            while (i + 1 < n && dir == direction(ratings[i], ratings[i + 1])) {\\n                run++;\\n                i++;\\n            }\\n            if (dir == 0) {\\n                ans += run;\\n                ans -= 1;\\n                prev = 1;\\n            } else {\\n                ans += run * (run + 1) / 2;\\n                if (dir == -1) {\\n                    ans -= min(prev, run);\\n                } else {\\n                    ans -= 1;\\n                }\\n                prev = run;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Time Complexity:** O(n) - One pass through the array.\\n**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only constant number of extra variables used.\\n\\n\\n**Upvote** if you like quick and simple explanations!\\n\\n**Join our discord** to meet other people prepping for interviews!\\n**https://discord.gg/7wpQQFYC**",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nTo maintain the given rule, the solution uses a two-pass approach:\\n\\n- **First Pass (Forward Traversal):**\\n\\nIn the first pass, the code iterates through the ratings from left to right. For each child, it checks if the child to the right has a higher rating. If so, it gives the current child one more candy than the child to the left. This step ensures that children with higher ratings receive more candies than their lower-rated neighbours.\\n\\n- **Second Pass (Backward Traversal):**\\n\\nIn the second pass, the code iterates through the ratings from right to left. For each child, it checks if the child to the left has a higher rating and ***hasn\\'t received more candies already*** (this is to prevent over-candying). If both conditions are met, it gives the left child more candy than the rigth child.\\n\\nBy performing these two passes, the solution guarantees that both conditions are met while minimizing the total number of candies distributed. The key insight is that you can start with an initial distribution of one candy per child and adjust it as needed based on the ratings and neighboring children. This approach ensures fairness and satisfies the problem constraints efficiently.\\n\\nIn summary, the intuition of this solution is to iteratively adjust the number of candies given to each child based on their ratings and the ratings of their neighbors, ensuring that the conditions of the problem are met while minimizing the total number of candies distributed. It\\'s a greedy approach that works by making local decisions to achieve a globally optimal solution.\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n\\n# Approach\\nHere\\'s how the code works:\\n\\nIt first initializes a vector called \\'candy\\' with the same length as the input \\'ratings\\' vector, with each element set to \"1\". Each child is initially given one candy.\\n\\nIn the first pass (forward traversal), it checks for increasing ratings. If the rating of the next child is higher than the current child, it gives the next child one more candy than the current child. This ensures that children with higher ratings receive more candies.\\n\\nIn the second pass (backward traversal), it checks for decreasing ratings. **If the rating of the previous child is higher, and the previous child hasn\\'t received more candies already**, it gives the previous child one more candy to satisfy the rule.\\n\\nFinally, it calculates the total number of candies distributed by summing up the elements in the candy vector and returns that value as the minimum total number of candies needed to satisfy the constraints.\\n\\nThis code guarantees that the constraints are met while minimizing the total number of candies distributed.\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n)\\n10ms RUNTIME - Beats 95% solutions\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(n)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n        int n = ratings.size() ;\\n        vector<int> candy(n, 1) ;\\n        \\n        //First Pass:Forward traversal to handle increasing ratings\\n        for(int i = 0; i<n-1; i++) {\\n            if(ratings[i+1] > ratings[i])\\n                candy[i+1] = candy[i] + 1 ; //If the next child has a higher rating, give them one more candy than previous child\\n        }\\n        \\n        //Second Pass:Backward traversal to handle decreasing ratings\\n        for(int i = n-1; i>0; i--) {\\n            if(ratings[i-1] > ratings[i] && candy[i-1] <= candy[i])\\n                candy[i-1] = candy[i] + 1 ; \\n                //If the previous child has a higher rating and hasn\\'t received more candy, give them more candy than current child\\n        }\\n\\n        int totalCandy = 0 ;\\n        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++)\\n            totalCandy = totalCandy + candy[i] ;\\n        \\n        return totalCandy ;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n# IF YOU UNDERSTOOD AND LIKED THE CODE, PLEASE UPVOTE",

First, we can allocate 1 candy to each child. Then, we can do a forward scan and check if the current child\\'s rating is greater than the previous child\\'s rating. If it is, we can give one more candy to the current child than the previous child. Similarly, we can do a backward scan and check if the current child\\'s rating is greater than the next child\\'s rating. If it is, we can give one more candy to the current child than the next child. Finally, we can return the sum of the candies allocated to all the children.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n  def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:\\n    n = len(ratings)\\n    candies = [1] * n  # Allocate 1 candy to each child\\n    for i in range(1, n):\\n        if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:\\n            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1  # Give one more candy to current child than previous child\\n    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\\n        if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:\\n            candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)  # Give one more candy to current child than next child\\n    return sum(candies)  # Return the total number of candies allocated\\n\\n```",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nMy initial thoughts on how to solve this problem are to iterate through the ratings array and compare each element with its neighboring elements. If an element is greater than its previous element, I would assign it one more candy than the previous element. Similarly, if an element is greater than its next element, I would assign it one more candy than the next element. This way, I can ensure that higher-rated students receive more candies than their neighbors.\\n\\n# Approach\\nTo solve the problem, I will use a greedy approach. I will initialize a result variable as 0 to keep track of the total number of candies needed. I will also create two arrays, ltr and rtl, both of length n (where n is the number of elements in the ratings array).

A simple explanation is that if this kid\\'s rating is higher than the preceding one, he/she should be assigned one more candy.\\n\\n**case 2: stable trend**\\nIf the current kid\\'s has the same rating with the preceding kid: we reset `inc` to be `0`.\\n\\n**case 3: decreasing trend**\\nThis case is a bit of complicated.  We add `dec` to `sum`, then increment `dec`. After doing so, we check whether the decresing trend terminates or changes. If the current element is the last element, we say \"the trend terminates\". If the next kid\\'s rating is not less than this one, we say \"the trend changes\". In either situation, a \\'compensation settlement\\' should be processed.\\n\\nThere are two tasks in the **compensation settlement**: first, we check whether `dec` is greater than `inc`, if so, we append their difference to `sum`. That is, `if (dec > ince) sum += (dec - inc); ` Note, `inc` is not updated in the decreasing section, it holds the peak value at the top of this downward slope. That\\'s why we compare `inc` and `dec` and update `sum`. The second task is to reset `inc` and `dec` to `0`.\\n\\nThe following code combines these two tasks in one statement (which is not very readable yet makes the whole code block more \\'compressed\\').\\n\\n```\\npublic int candy(int[] kid) {\\n  int sum = kid.length;\\n  int inc = 0;\\n  int dec = 0;\\n  \\n  for (int i = 1; i < kid.length; ++i) {\\n    if (kid[i - 1] < kid[i]) {\\n\\t  sum += (++inc);\\n\\t}\\n\\telse if (kid[i - 1] == kid[i]) {\\n\\t  inc = 0;\\n\\t}\\n\\telse {\\n\\t  sum += (dec++);\\n      // compensation settlement\\n\\t  if (i + 1 == kid.length || kid[i] <= kid[i + 1])\\n\\t    sum += Math.max(dec - inc, dec = inc = 0);\\n\\t}\\n  }\\n  return sum;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n**Supplements:**\\n1. `sum` is initialized with the value of `kid.length`, which means that we already give each kid at least one candy.\\n\\n2. why the default value of `inc` and `dec` are `0`\\'s and why `sum` is updated in the form `(++inc)` and `(dec++)`? A simple explanation is that they (initial values and updating logic) are not fixed, however, they need to be consistent with each other (and other conditions). By comparing different initial values and corresponding update statements, I think the following code is concisest. You can, say, set the default value of `inc` to be `1` or set the default value of `dec` to be `-1`, etc. Yet, if so, you need also to adjust your code. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

In the first pass, we scan the ratings from left to right and assign candies to each child based on the increasing ratings from left to right. In the second pass, we scan the ratings from right to left and adjust the candies assigned based on the increasing ratings from right to left. The idea is to ensure that each child gets at least one candy and children with higher ratings get more candies than their neighbors.\\n\\n# Algorithm:\\n\\nInitialize an array left of size n+1 to store the number of candies assigned to each child based on the increasing ratings from left to right. Set all elements of left to 1, as each child must have at least one candy.\\nPerform the first pass (left to right) over the ratings array and update the left array as follows:\\na. If the rating of the current child ratings[i] is greater than the rating of the previous child ratings[i-1], assign one more candy than the previous child to the current child (i.e., left[i] = left[i-1] + 1).\\nInitialize a variable right to 1, which will be used to keep track of the candies for the second pass (right to left).\\nPerform the second pass (right to left) over the ratings array and update the left array as follows:\\na. If the rating of the current child ratings[i] is greater than the rating of the next child ratings[i+1], we increment the right variable by 1.\\nb. We then update the number of candies for the current child by taking the maximum between the current value in the left array and the value of right. This step ensures that we consider both the left-to-right and right-to-left information while assigning candies.\\nAfter both passes are completed, sum up all the elements in the left array to get the minimum number of candies needed to satisfy the requirements.\\nComplexity Analysis:\\n\\n# Time Complexity:\\n The algorithm performs two passes through the ratings array, which takes O(n) time, where n is the number of children.\\n# Space Complexity:\\n The algorithm uses a left array of size n+1 to store the candies assigned to each child, which takes O(n) extra space.\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n        int n=ratings.size();\\n      vector<int> left(n+1,1);\\n      for(int i=1;i<n;i++){\\n          if(ratings[i]>ratings[i-1]) left[i]=left[i-1]+1;\\n      }  \\n\\n      int right=1;\\n      for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--){\\n          if(ratings[i]>ratings[i+1]){\\n            right++;\\n            left[i]=max(left[i],right);\\n          }else right=1;\\n      }\\n\\n      int sum=0;\\n      for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\\n            sum+=left[i];\\n      }\\n      return sum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

We have to distribute candies to these children such that the total number of candies distributed are minimum. We have to consider the following conditions while distributing:\\n* Each child must recieve atleast 1 candy.\\n* The child with higher rating than his neighbours, must recieve more candies than them.\\n\\n## **Approach**:\\nWe will take a vector of integer, candies, of size \\'n\\' and initialize all values with \\'1\\'. Then we would check whether the size of ratings, i.e., the number of children is less than or equal to 1, in which case, we would return the size itself.\\n\\nThen we will run a loop from 1 till n, where we will check if the rating of the current child is greater than the previous one, if yes, we would set the value of candies with the child as 1 more than the candies with the previous one.\\n\\nWe would then run a loop from n-1, i.e., the last child till i is greater than 0, and we would check if the previous, i.e., i-1 has more rating than i, then we would set value of i-1th one as, the maximum of increment of ith one and his own candies.\\n\\nFinally, we have assigned the candies to be distributed to each child, now we would just run an iteration for each child and add the number of candies to total number of candies.\\n\\nAnd we will return the total candies.\\n\\n## **Solution**:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n        int n = ratings.size(); //total number of children\\n        int totalcandies = 0; //set total candies as 0\\n        \\n        if(n<=1) //check if the number of children are 1 or less\\n            return n;\\n        \\n        vector<int> candies(n,1); // initialize a vector candies with 1 of size n\\n        for(int i=1;i<n;i++)\\n            if(ratings[i]>ratings[i-1]) //if the current child\\'s rating is more than the previous one\\n                candies[i]=candies[i-1]+1; //set his candies as 1 more than the previous one\\n        \\n        for(int i=n-1;i>0;i--)\\n            if(ratings[i-1]>ratings[i]) //if the i-1th child has more rating than ith one\\n                candies[i-1]=max(candies[i-1],candies[i]+1); //set the i-1th candies as maximum of his own and 1 more than the previous one\\n        \\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)\\n            totalcandies+=candies[i]; //add each child\\'s number of candies to the total\\n        \\n        return totalcandies; //return the total number of candies\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Obviously, this decrease array can be easily created by scanning ratings array from tail to head. \\n\\nWith this decrease array constructed, we can calculate candies for each child without backtrace.\\n\\n    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n        if( ratings.empty()) return 0;\\n        vector<int> decrease(ratings.size());\\n        decrease[ratings.size()-1] = 1;\\n        for( int i=ratings.size()-2; i>=0; i-- ) {\\n            if( ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] ) decrease[i] = decrease[i+1]+1;\\n            else decrease[i] = 1;\\n        }        \\n        vector<int> candy(ratings.size());\\n        candy[0] = decrease[0];\\n        int sum = candy[0];\\n        for( int i=1; i<ratings.size(); i++ ) {\\n            if( ratings[i] > ratings[i-1] ) candy[i] = max( decrease[i], candy[i-1]+1);\\n            else if( ratings[i] == ratings[i-1] ) {\\n                candy[i] = max( decrease[i], 1);\\n            }\\n            else candy[i] = min(candy[i-1]-1, decrease[i]);\\n            sum += candy[i];\\n        }\\n        return sum;\\n    }\\n\\nAnd, if you want to save more space, you can reuse the decrease array.\\n\\n    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n        if( ratings.empty()) return 0;\\n        vector<int> decrease(ratings.size());\\n        decrease[ratings.size()-1] = 1;\\n        for( int i=ratings.size()-2; i>=0; i-- ) {\\n            decrease[i] = ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] ? decrease[i+1] + 1 : 1;\\n        }        \\n        int sum = decrease[0];\\n        for( int i=1; i<ratings.size(); i++ ) {\\n            if( ratings[i] > ratings[i-1] ) \\n                decrease[i] = max( decrease[i], decrease[i-1]+1);\\n            else if( ratings[i] == ratings[i-1] ) \\n                decrease[i] = max( decrease[i], 1);\\n            else \\n                decrease[i] = min(decrease[i-1]-1, decrease[i]);\\n            sum += decrease[i];\\n        }\\n        return sum;\\n    }",

The logic I was following:   \\ninitialize an array of size n, called candies, with all values set to 0    \\nset first value to 1    \\niterate through ratings array, starting at one, and check:   \\n  for element i in array rating:   \\n\\n 1. if rating[i] is greater than rating[i-1], set current candy nr. to\\n    previous nr.+1\\n 2. if rating[i] is equal to rating[i-1], set current candy nr. to the same nr. as previous\\n 3. if rating[i] is less than rating[i-1], there are two possible  situations:\\n\\n \\n - a) we can safely subtract 1 for previous candy number and still get a number that is greater than one; in that case set current candy nr.  to 1   \\n - b) setting the current candy nr. to previous-1 would be less than 1; in    that case we need to backtrack; continue backtracking     while    previous rating is greater than the current && previous  candy    nr.    is less than or equal to the current; in each   iteration increase       the previous candy nr.\\n\\n\\nI think my code now is pretty straighforward:\\n\\n    public int candy(int[] ratings) {\\n             \\n                if (ratings== null) return -1;\\n                int n = ratings.length;\\n                int[] candies = new int[n];\\n                if (n==0) return 0;\\n                candies[0] = 1;\\n                int sum = 1;\\n                for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {\\n                    if (ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]) {\\n\\n                        candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1;\\n                        sum+=candies[i];\\n\\n                    } else if (ratings[i] == ratings[i-1]) {\\n                        \\n                        candies[i] = candies[i-1];\\n                        sum+=candies[i];\\n                    \\n                   }else {\\n                        if (candies[i-1]-1 >= 1) {\\n                             candies[i] = 1;\\n                            sum+= candies[i];\\n                        } else {\\n                            int k = i;\\n                            candies[k]++;\\n                            sum++;\\n                            while (k>0 && ratings[k]<ratings[k-1] && candies[k-1]<=candies[k]) {\\n                                candies[k-1]++;\\n                                sum++;\\n                                k--;\\n                            }\\n                        } \\n                    }\\n                }\\n                return sum;\\n            }\\n\\n[UPDATE:] Here is the failed case: [58,21,72,77,48,9,38,71,68,77,82,47,25,94,89,54,26,54,54,99,64,71,76,63,81,82,60,64,29,51,87,87,72,12,16,20,21,54,43,41,83,77,41,61,72,82,15,50,36,69,49,53,92,77,16,73,12,28,37,41,79,25,80,3,37,48,23,10,55,19,51,38,96,92,99,68,75,14,18,63,35,19,68,28,49,36,53,61,64,91,2,43,68,34,46,57,82,22,67,89]\\n\\nExpected: 208, I got: 210.",

Each child must have at least one candy.\\n2. Children with a higher rating than their neighbors must get more candies.\\n- The goal is to minimize the total number of candies used while satisfying these rules\\n# Approach\\n\\nHere\\'s the approach used in the provided C++ code:\\n\\n- Initialize a vector left with the same size as the input ratings vector. This vector will store the number of candies given to each child based on the ratings from the left side.\\n\\n- First Pass (from left to right):\\n\\n- Iterate through the ratings vector from left to right (from index 1 to the end).\\nIf the current child\\'s rating is greater than the previous child\\'s rating, increment the number of candies given to the current child by one more than what the previous child received (i.e., left[i] = left[i-1] + 1).Otherwise, leave left[i] as 1 because the current child\\'s rating is not greater than the previous one.\\nInitialize a variable right to 1. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of candies given to the children from the right side.\\n\\n- Second Pass (from right to left):\\n\\n- Iterate through the ratings vector from right to left (from the second-to-last element to the first element).\\nIf the current child\\'s rating is greater than the next child\\'s rating, increment right by 1 (since this child needs more candies than the next one).\\n- Update left[i] by taking the maximum of its current value and right (to ensure that the child gets the maximum of what they need from both sides).\\n- If the current child\\'s rating is not greater than the next one, reset right to 1, indicating that this child starts a new descending sequence.\\n- Calculate the total sum of candies in the left vector, which represents the minimum total number of candies needed to satisfy the given rules.\\n\\n- Return the total sum as the result.\\n\\nThis approach ensures that each child receives the required minimum number of candies while taking into account both left and right ratings comparisons. The final result is the minimum total number of candies needed to satisfy the rulesThe problem statement is as follows: You are given a list of ratings for a group of children, and you want to distribute candies to these children based on the following rules:\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:**0(N)**\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:**0(N)**\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n        vector<int>left(ratings.size()+1,1);\\n        // vector<int>right(ratings.size()+1,1);\\n        for(int i = 1; i < ratings.size(); i++ )\\n        {\\n            if(ratings[i]>ratings[i-1])\\n            {\\n                left[i]=left[i-1]+1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        int right = 1;\\n        for(int i = ratings.size()-2;i>=0;i--)\\n        {\\n            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i+1])\\n            {\\n                right++;\\n                left[i]=max(right, left[i]);\\n            }\\n            else\\n            right = 1;\\n        }\\n        int sum = 0 ;\\n        for(int i = 0; i < ratings.size(); i++ )\\n            sum+=left[i];\\n        return sum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "This corresponds to the \"slope\" solution. \\n\\n`front` denotes the number of candies at the \"front\". What is the front? It depends on the slope:\\n- if the slope is increasing or plateau-ing, the front is just the number of candies to give to the next kid;\\n- if the slope is decreasing, the front is the bottom of the slope - which is always `1`.\\n\\n`top` denotes the number of candies at the top of the hill, which is the element that is joining the previous (increasing) slope and the next (decreasing) slope.\\n\\nWhen we are in a decreasing slope, we need to make sure that we are not giving more candies to the kids in this slope than to the kid at the top. To ensure this, we record the number of kids in the slope aka `dec_count`. If there are `dec_count` kids in the slope, it means we should have given `dec_count` candies to the right neighbour of the `top` kid. Thus, since the `top` kid needs to have strictly more candies, he will end up having `dec_count + 1`.\\n\\nImplementation-wise, when we enter the decreasing slope, the top kid has whatever number of candies he had to satisfy the previous slope. Then we slide down the slope, and we count the kids: whenever the top kid has less than the current number of kids + 1, we give him one more candy. The code can be confusing: keep in mind that, on the ith iteration, we are not computing the number to give to the ith kid based on the i - 1 kid: we are computing the number of candies to give to the i + 1 th kid, and correcting the total number of candies `res` a posteriori after we witness that there is one more kid in the slope, and the top kid had fewer candies than what he should have. In a nutshell, we are simply correcting our mistake on the top kid by giving him more candies as needed, 1 by 1.\\n\\nComplexity: O(n) time - O(1) space\\n\\n```\\nuse std::cmp::{self, Ordering};\\n\\npub fn candy(ratings: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {\\n        ratings\\n        .windows(2)\\n        .map(|x| x[0].cmp(&x[1]))\\n        .fold((1, 1, 1, 0), |(res, front, top, dec_count): (i32, i32, i32, i32), x| {\\n           match x {\\n            Ordering::Greater => {\\n                if top <= dec_count + 1 {\\n                    (res + dec_count + 1 + 1, 1, top + 1, dec_count + 1)\\n                } else {\\n                    (res + dec_count + 1, 1, top, dec_count + 1)\\n                }\\n            },\\n            Ordering::Equal => {\\n                (res + 1, 1, 1, 0)\\n            },\\n            Ordering::Less => {\\n                (res + front + 1, front + 1, front + 1, 0)\\n            }\\n           } \\n        })\\n        .0\\n    }\\n```",

                "content": "If you draw all the rating points on a graph, there are peaks and bottoms and apparently:\\n\\n1. All the bottoms should be given 1 candy in the final result.\\n2. The neighbors of the bottoms should be given 1 more candy as we move from bottom point to peak point.\\n\\nFor example if you have an array [1,2,4,3,2,1], bottoms are the 1s on both sides and the peak is 4, both 1s should be given 1 candy and their neighbors 2s should be given 1+1=2 candies. Likewise, 3 should be given 2+1=3 candies and 4 which is the peak should be given 4 candies. If we know the lengths from the peak to bottom on both sides, we can figure out how many candies should be given to the peak (Math.max(left, right)) and the total candies needed for the array. For the above example, the length on the left is 2 ([1,2] peak not included) and length on the right is 3([3,2,1] peak not included), thus the peak should be assign Math.max(left, right)+1 candies and the total candies needed for the array will be (1+left)*left/2 + (1+right)*right/2 + peak. In the codes below, we minus it by 1 because the left bottom was calculated once in the previous round.\\n\\nIn real test cases, we can have array with multiple peaks and bottoms. For example: [1,2,4,3,2,1,5,6,9,4,2].

                "content": "Though the smartest solution to this problem is the two-pass solution, I have come up with a stack-based solution which requires O(n) space. It can be further optimized to eliminate the stack structure.\\n\\nThe idea is as follows: assign as few candies as possible. First assign 1 candy to the first kid, then go through the kid one by one. If we encounter kids in increasing rating value, we simply increment the candy number for each kid and we are done. But if we encounter kids in decreasing rating value, we need to fix previous candy values to avoid zero or negative candies to the current kid. Thus I use a stack to keep track of the kids with decreasing ratings, so that we can give more candies to them when the 2nd requirement is violated. I use a subroutine `clearStack` to count the actual number of candies required for these kids. For each kid, there are three cases:\\n\\n1. current kid has higher rating than previous kid: in this case, we assign one more candy to this kid. Also pop all previous kids out (and count candies for them), and push current kid's candy number\\n2. current kid has equal rating to previous kid: we just assign 1 candy to this kid. Use the same stack operation as 1.\\n3. current kid has less rating to previous kid: we also assign only 1 candy to this kid temporarily, and push it to stack (to be fixed later)\\n\\nI also use a sentinel in the end of ratings to trigger `clearStack` at the last element.\\n\\nCode is as follows:\\n\\n\\n    class Solution {\\n    public:\\n        int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {\\n            ratings.insert(ratings.end(), INT_MAX); //sentinel at the end\\n            \\n            int n = ratings.size();\\n            if(n <= 1) return n; //corner cases\\n            \\n            int sum(0); //total number of candies\\n            int curr(0); //number of candies for current kid\\n            \\n            stack<int> s;\\n            s.push(1); //candy for the first kid\\n            for(int k = 1; k < n; ++k) {\\n                if(ratings[k] >= ratings[k-1]) { //current higher or equal than previous\\n                    if(ratings[k] == ratings[k-1]) curr = 1; \\n                    else curr = s.top()+1;\\n                    sum += clearStack(s); //count all previous\\n                    s.push(curr); //push current candy number in stack (don't count yet)\\n                } else { //lower than previous\\n                    s.push(1); //just give one candy to this kid, don't count yet\\n                }\\n            }\\n    \\n            return sum;\\n        }\\n        \\n        //count the actual number of candies of kids in the stack\\n        int clearStack(stack<int>& s) {\\n            int sum = 0;\\n            int curr(0), last(0);\\n            while(!s.empty()) {\\n                int curr = s.top(); s.pop();\\n                if(curr <= last) curr = last+1;\\n                sum += curr;\\n                last = curr;\\n            }\\n            return sum;\\n        }\\n    };",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nThe problem requires distributing candies to a line of children based on their ratings while satisfying two conditions: each child must have at least one candy, and children with higher ratings should get more candies than their neighbors. To minimize the total number of candies, we can follow a simple approach that ensures these conditions are met.\\n\\n# Approach\\nWe can start by initializing an array `candies` to keep track of the number of candies each child receives. We\\'ll initialize all elements of `candies` to 1 since each child must have at least one candy.\\n\\nWe then iterate through the ratings array from left to right, and for each child `i`, we compare their rating with the rating of the previous child (`i-1`). If the current child has a higher rating, we give them one more candy than the previous child by setting `candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1`. If not, we leave their candy count as 1.\\n\\nNext, we iterate through the ratings array from right to left, and for each child `i`, we compare their rating with the rating of the next child (`i+1`). If the current child has a higher rating and has fewer or equal candies than the next child, we update their candy count to be one more than the next child\\'s candy count by setting `candies[i] = candies[i+1] + 1`.\\n\\nFinally, we calculate the total number of candies by summing up all the elements in the `candies` array.\\n\\nThis approach ensures that both conditions are met, and it minimizes the total number of candies required.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$ - We iterate through the ratings array twice, once from left to right and once from right to left, where n is the number of children.\\n- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$ - We use an additional array `candies` of size n to store the number of candies for each child.\\n\\n# Code\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int candy(int[] ratings) {\\n        int n = ratings.length;\\n        int[] candies = new int[n];\\n        candies[0] = 1;\\n\\n        // First pass: Left to right\\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\\n            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {\\n                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;\\n            } else {\\n                candies[i] = 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        // Second pass: Right to left\\n        int totalCandies = candies[n - 1];\\n        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {\\n            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1] && candies[i] <= candies[i + 1]) {\\n                candies[i] = candies[i + 1] + 1;\\n            }\\n            totalCandies += candies[i];\\n        }\\n\\n        return totalCandies;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Here\\'s a simplified approach:\\n1. Initialize the candies array with all elements set to 1, ensuring that each child receives at least one candy.\\n2. Traverse the ratings array from left to right, starting from the second child.\\n3. If the current child\\'s rating is greater than the previous child\\'s rating, assign candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1, ensuring the current child receives one more candy than the previous child.\\n4. Traverse the ratings array from right to left, starting from the second-to-last child.\\n5. If the current child\\'s rating is greater than the next child\\'s rating, and their current assigned number of candies (candies[i]) is less than or equal to the next child\\'s candies plus one (candies[i + 1] + 1), update candies[i] to be one more than the next child\\'s candies.\\n6. Calculate and return the sum of all elements in the candies array. This represents the minimum number of candies needed to distribute among the children while meeting the requirements.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n1. Initialize an array candies of the same length as the ratings array, with all elements set to 1.\\n2.

Additinally, it should meet two requirements:\\n\\n1) LEFT. For i > 0, M[i] > M[i-1] if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1].\\n\\n2) RIGHT. For i < n-1, M[i] > M[i+1] if ratings[i] > ratins[i+1].\\n\\nTo get the minimum sum of M[], we change the two requirements as:\\n\\n1) LEFT. For i > 0, **M[i] = M[i-1] + 1** if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1].\\n\\n2) RIGHT. For i < n-1, **M[i] = M[i+1] + 1** if ratings[i] > ratins[i+1].\\n\\nThen, the algorithm starts from i = 0 to n-2 for the first pass and compute M[] only following LEFT. Then in the second pass, starts from i = n-2 to 0 and update M[] following RIGHT and LEFT.\\n\\nAnyone has idea to prove that the algorithm would give the correct answer? or we do not need to prove since it is naturally correct?\\n\\n\\n  [1]: http://www.cnblogs.com/zzzdevil/p/3649525.html"

                "content": "# Intuition\\nLooking at the problem statement, we can see that this problem resembles a multidimensional knapsack problem, which we know to be NP-hard, and the small input size constraints seem to confirm that we may be dealing with an exponential-time solution. One approach here that comes to mind is that of backtracking.\\n\\n# Approach\\nIf we consider a recursive backtracking depth-first search approach, we would follow something like this:\\n1. For any given state, if it is a solution, report it. Otherwise...\\n2. Construct the set of possible candidates for the next choice\\n3. For each candidate, make a move that modifies the state\\n4. Using this new state, recur to continue backtracking\\n5. After returning from this recursion, unmake the move to undo any state modification\\n\\nIn this problem, we know what our possible candidates are: at each step in our backtracking process, our next move could be to either use the original item prices, or to use an offer.\\n\\nNext, for making a move, we need to be careful with efficiency. When we make a move, it just boils down to buying some quantity of some items, so we can remove those items from the `needs` vector. We could try clone the vector and modify the clone, then pass this clone down to recursive calls, but this will require space proportional to the needs size multiplied by the recursion tree height. Instead, we\\'ll opt for an approach that doesn\\'t clone the vector thus saving space: before recurring deeper, modify the original vector to its new state. This is fine, since we\\'ll never need the previous state in any children calls. Then once we finish that recursion, we can simply undo our vector modifications. Through all recursion then, simply pass a reference to the original vector.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Details\\n\\nWith a basic scaffold, we can work on the details. At any recursive call, define our state to be value of the `needs` vector. Since we can use the original prices and specials as many times as we want, their states don\\'t depend on our choices, so our recursive state is completely defined by the value of this vector.\\n\\nSo, at each recursive call, we keep track of a minimum cost achievable moving forward from the current state. This minimum cost will initially be the trivial case where we buy all the remaining items using their original prices. This is just the inner product between the `price` and `needs` vectors, i.e. `price[0]*needs[0] + price[1]*needs[1] + ...`.\\n\\nThe remaining candidates are now the `special`s. We can iterate through each special offer. At each iteration, we \\'apply\\' the special to the needs vector, which just means going through the offer and \\'buying\\' each item required by the offer (subtracting each `offer[i]` from `needs[i]`). But, we aren\\'t allowed to buy any more items than we originally needed, so if any value of `needs` ever becomes < 0, that means we bought too much of that item and we aren\\'t allowed to use that special from the current state, in which case we\\'ll just undo the \\'application\\' of the special and skip to looking at the next special.\\n\\nAfter we have validly applied a special from `special` to `needs`, we can now backtrack using our new state. After that recursive call returns with the minimum cost from that new state, we have two options for updating the `min_cost` at our current state: 1. we keep `min_cost` the same, since our recursion did not reveal a cheaper path by using the selected special, or 2. the cost of the special offer we selected plus the minimum cost of that resulting state is less than our current cheapest known option, in which case we\\'ll set that to the new current `min_cost` from this state.\\n\\nAfter backtracking further and updating the minimum cost so far for this state, we can undo the modifications to the `needs` vector.\\n\\nFinally, we will return the `min_cost` found from this state.\\n\\nOne thing to note is that we never explicitly check if the state is a solution as was outlined in the approach, since at any given state, if it is a solution, then all `needs` will be 0. So, all subsequent attempts to apply a special offer will fail since they will all cause a `needs[i]` to be < 0, and so the recursive call will just return as if a solution were detected.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Optimisations\\n\\nWith a backtracking approach, proper optimisations and search pruning can have a significant performance improvement. In this case, 2 obvious optimisations come to mind.\\n\\nFirst, as we iterate through our special offers, if ever the cost of that offer would exceed the current `min_cost`, then we know that selecting that offer cannot lead to any cheaper path, so we can skip recurring with that offer entirely.\\n\\nSecond, we can identify that through the recursion, there will be many backtracking calls to the exact same `needs` state. However, since each subproblem is completely uniquely identified by its `needs` vector, that means that any call to `shoppingOffers` with the same `needs` will always return the same minimum cost. So, it makes sense to try a memoization approach, where we cache a `min_cost` value whenever we compute it, so if we ever end up with a duplicate call, we can just immediately return with the cached value without having to waste time going all the way down the recursion tree again.\\n\\nWhen doing memoization in this way, one approach would be to use some sort of associative map to relate the state (key) to the resulting `min_cost` (value). In this case, our key would be the `needs` vector, but we need a way of producing a hash of this vector to act as a lookup key. An effective approach here is to build a bitmask: we know that `needs` can have at most `6` elements, and each of these elements is between `0` and `10` inclusive. So, each element can be represented using 4 bits, and so all 6 elements can be represented using `6*4=24` bits, which means we can store our entire state in a single 32-bit integer, which will become our bitmask.\\n\\nWith this in mind, at each recursive call, first compute the mask and check if a memoized value for that mask already exists. If so, just return that value and don\\'t recur further. Otherwise, run the computation, then insert the resultant `min_cost` into the map using the mask as its key before returning.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n\\n### Time complexity\\n$O(s \\\\cdot n \\\\cdot m^n)$, where $s$ is the length of `special`, $n$ is the length of `price` and `needs`, and $m$ is the number of unique values `price[i]` and `needs[i]` can take on.\\n**Explanation**: Since we\\'re memoizing intermediate values, the number of times the function will be run is proportional to the maximum number of unique cache keys. In this case, the state of `needs` is being used as a key, and with $n$ elements which can each take on up to $m$ unique values, this gives $m^n$ possible unique cache values. For each of these function calls, all `special`s are iterated over totalling $s$ times, and for each of those iterations, all `needs` are iterated over totalling up to $2n$ times. Multiplying these together gives the total time complexity.\\n\\n### Space complexity\\n$O(m^n)$, where $m$ is the number of unique values `price[i]` and `needs[i]` can take on, and $n$ is the length of `price` and `needs`.\\n**Explanation**: We store in the worst case all possible unique states of `needs`, and as described in the time complexity analysis, this is poportional to $m^n$. The stack depth from recursion will also be proportional to the number of unique states, as recursion will stop and return immediately when a memoized value is found.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\nprivate:\\n    // Store the minimum cost found for subproblems at a given state of needs.\\n    // Since each need is in [0,10], each need can be represented in 4 bits.\\n    // Since there are up to 6 needs, the entire needs state can be represented in 6*4=24 bits.\\n    // So, we can use a 32-bit integer mask as a key in the map to uniquely identify a needs state.\\n    unordered_map<int32_t, int> min_cost_for_state;\\n\\npublic:\\n    int shoppingOffers(vector<int>& price, vector<vector<int>>& special, vector<int>& needs) {\\n        // Make a bitmask of the current needs state\\n        int32_t mask = 0;\\n        for (int need : needs)\\n            mask = (mask | need) << 4;\\n\\n        // If already cached result of this needs state, return that\\n        if (min_cost_for_state.count(mask))\\n            return min_cost_for_state[mask];\\n\\n        // At this point, can either pick the regular item prices, or specials.\\n        // Start of by setting the minimum cost as that of using the regular prices for the remaining needed items.\\n        int min_cost = inner_product(price.begin(), price.end(), needs.begin(), 0);\\n\\n        // Now test all the specials\\n        for (const auto &special_offer : special) {\\n            // Prune the search: if buying a special causes a price > current min, don\\'t bother\\n            if (special_offer.back() > min_cost)\\n                continue;\\n\\n            // Keep track of if come across negative needs, where we would buy more than needed\\n            int bought_too_much = false;\\n            // Temporarily apply the special to the needs vector, subtracting the purchased items from the needed items\\n            for (int i = 0; i < needs.size(); ++i) {\\n                needs[i] -= special_offer[i];\\n                // Stop if we\\'ve found a negative need, since that\\'s invalid - undo the application\\n                if (needs[i] < 0) {\\n                    while (i >= 0) {\\n                        needs[i] += special_offer[i];\\n                        --i;\\n                    }\\n                    bought_too_much = true;\\n                    break;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Don\\'t recur if we\\'ve found a negative need, since that is invalid\\n            if (bought_too_much) continue;\\n\\n            // Update the current minimum cost if applying this special leads to a lower cost\\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, special_offer.back() + shoppingOffers(price, special, needs));\\n\\n            // Undo the temporary application of the special to the needs vector\\n            for (int i = 0; i < needs.size(); ++i)\\n                needs[i] += special_offer[i];\\n        }\\n\\n        // Cache this min cost value\\n        min_cost_for_state[mask] = min_cost;\\n\\n        // Return the current minimum cost\\n        return min_cost;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```",

                "content": "### Recursion + Memoziation + Bitmask\\nIt requires to return the minimum price we use to purchase all of `needs` items without more unneeded items, which means the special offer can\\'t be used as long as the count for any item is more than the number of `needed` item. For example, we need `[3,2]` for a and b items, then the special `[3,1]` is availble but `[2,3]` is not. Because the `3` for b is more than `2` even `2` for a is smaller than needed `3`.\\n\\nBesides, the special offers can be used as many times as we can, we can just iterate each special offer to see if it\\'s possible to use, and recursively call the same function to get the minimum price with changed `needs`.\\nThen it comes to the most difficult part of this prolem, how to memorize the result according to `needs`.  If you don\\'t understand why we need memorization, you might need recall that recursion will invovle redundant calculation that can be cached for further use to save time.\\n\\nYou might come up with the approach that we can use tuple/list of `needs` as `key` to represent the state, However it might inefficient. Note that the number of items is up to 6, and the number of pieces for each item up to 10, which indicates we might be able to use bitmask as counter for the `state`. Since we can use 4 bits to represent up to 16 which is larger than 10, and `4 * 6 = 24 < 32 bit`, we can use one integer number `state` simply to represent counters of `needs`. \\nWell, how to get the count and set new count to `state` might take you more time to settle down. \\n\\n**Get Count**\\nSince we use 4 bits for one counter, we can simply shift right `state` to ignore other counters and get the least 4 significant bits \\n```\\nget(i):\\n     state >> 4 * i & ((1 << 4) - 1)\\n```\\n\\n**Set Count**\\nWe do the similar thing as getting count, shift right `state` to set the least significant 4 bits and shift left back and union the other bits from original `state`.\\n```\\nset(i, count):\\n    ((state >> 4 * i) | ~((1 << 4)  - 1)| count) << 4 * i) | (state & ((1 << 4 * i) - 1))\\n```\\n\\nSince we always set the `state` sequentially, so we can just incrementally set the least 4 significant bits without shifting back, which can simplify the code. At the same time, the `getCount` should be modified to shift right reversely.

As we know price and special arrays are fixed and won\\'t change, the only thing changes is \\'needs\\' array, i.e. how many remaining items of each kind for us to buy.\\n2. One reasonable assumption is that for any special offer, its price is lower than buying all the items in it separately. With this observation, each time we are dealing with a \\'needs\\' array, we can first calculate the price to buy everything separately without using any special offer, this price will be the upper bound, then apply all the valid special offers (with the restriction that we cannot buy more than needed) and find the minimum price.\\n3.

But that solution would Time out very easily. But when I swapped out `vector<int>` for `unordered_map<int,int>`, that same code was accepted with very good runtime. \\n\\nWhy is that?\\nWell, lets look at the limits. I was initializing my old cache using `dp.resize((1<<24)+10, -1);`. Let\\'s say that space allocation takes very little time. The loop to change every value to \\'-1\\' would run 16777216 times. Or, ~1.6x(10^7) times. This number is very important (and very big!). We know that C++ can do ~(10^8) operations in a second. Which means that the cache init loop alone would take 1/10 of a second to run. Regardless of whether all these values are used or not. \\n\\nSo I guess it is not always beneficial to use `vector<int>` instead of `unordered_map<int,int>`.

The minimum possible amount needed to buy the **needs** is basically calculating the price with the quantities needed without applying any offers. That is the first loop doing.\\n2. The next thing, the offers can be applied only if the items offered by that particular offer is less than or equal to the  needs.\\n3. For each offer, i can apply more than one time if the second rule holds. I\\'m itreating each offer and trying to apply again and again. (**offerTimes**)\\n4. Itreating through each offer, first i\\'ll apply for a single time i\\'ll calculate the remaining amounts needed (**sum value in the third for loop**) and add up the offer value and save the current buyable items with the offer value for future use.\\n5. If i can able to find the remaining items needed from the map i.e there is already an offer satisfying this particular needs, then i can use it and check if it is minimum.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure where the bug is.

In the worst case size of the DP table is 6^6 for every possible combination of needs. Time is thus proportional to number of offers multiplied by the the size of the DP table. Another multiplication factor is for every offer we try to add it to every state up to 6 times at most, which in current problem statement is a constant factor. If we consider 6^6 to be a constant as well, then total runtime is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of offers.\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def shoppingOffers(self, price, special, needs):\\n        def subtract(a_list, b_list):\\n            out = tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(a_list, b_list))\\n            return None if any(x < 0 for x in out) else out\\n        \\n        dp = {tuple(needs): 0}\\n        for offer in special:\\n            for needs, state_price in list(dp.items()):\\n                new_state, new_price = subtract(needs, offer), state_price + offer[-1]\\n                while new_state:\\n                    dp[new_state] = min(dp.get(new_state, math.inf), new_price)\\n                    new_state, new_price = subtract(new_state, offer), new_price + offer[-1]\\n                    \\n        return min(sum(p*x for p, x in zip(price, needs)) + state_price for needs, state_price in dp.items())\\n```",

                "content": "## 638. Shopping Offers\\n\\nIn LeetCode Store, there are n items to sell. Each item has a price. However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.\\n\\nYou are given an integer array price where price[i] is the price of the ith item, and an integer array needs where needs[i] is the number of pieces of the ith item you want to buy.\\n\\nYou are also given an array special where special[i] is of size n + 1 where special[i][j] is the number of pieces of the jth item in the ith offer and special[i][n] (i.e., the last integer in the array) is the price of the ith offer.\\n\\nReturn the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers. You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price. You could use any of the special offers as many times as you want.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n\\n* n == price.length == needs.length\\n* 1 <= n <= 6\\n* 0 <= price[i], needs[i] <= 10\\n* 1 <= special.length <= 100\\n* special[i].length == n + 1\\n* 0 <= special[i][j] <= 50\\n\\n### Intuition\\nWhen seeing the function array which represent the price and nums. It definitely will be a dynamic programming problem, because we can it has a iteration property. Easyly to see. A knapsack problem. \\n* First, we have special offer - quantity1,q2,q3.. and the total price for this offer, price for each item and needed.\\n* You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price. But I don\\'t know how to build dp equation. Let me see the std solution.\\n* Because it\\'s a DP problem, we definitely can write a iteration solution, but it\\'s a little bit complex. So we can use recursion with memorizable variable to solve it.\\n\\n### Approach\\n* step 1:each time first we calculate if we all use the original without special offer, what\\'s the price.\\n* step 2: then we try to use each special offer, if we can use it, we will use it, and then we will dfs to next level with the new needs which the items we purchased has been deducted.\\n* step 3: we will compare the price we get from step 1 and step 2, and return the min one.\\n\\n\\n### Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nBecause we need to iterate all possible combination of special offer, so the time complexity is $$O(2^n)$$\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nfor the recursion, we need to store the needs, so the space complexity is $$O(n^n)$$ because each elements in dict is a list with n elements, it has 0 - n possibilities, therefore in total we may have $$n^n$$ possibilities.\\n\\n### Code\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def shoppingOffers(self, price: List[int], special: List[List[int]], needs: List[int]) -> int:\\n        d = {}\\n        def dfs(price, special, needs):\\n            if not needs:\\n                return 0\\n            # calculate the price without special offer\\n            res = sum([price[i] * needs[i] for i in range(len(needs))])\\n            # try to use each special offer\\n            for offer in special:\\n                # check if we can use this offer\\n                for i in range(len(needs)):\\n                    if needs[i] < offer[i]:\\n                        break\\n                else:\\n                    # use this offer\\n                    tmp = [needs[j] - offer[j] for j in range(len(needs))]\\n                    if tuple(tmp) not in d:\\n                        d[tuple(tmp)] = dfs(price, special, tmp)\\n                    res = min(res, offer[-1] + d[tuple(tmp)])\\n            return res\\n        return dfs(price, special, needs)\\n```\\n",

So we write this transition as:\\n```\\ndp(state) = {\\n\\n            for i in range(n):\\n                next_state = state[:]\\n                next_state[i] += 1\\n                ans = min(ans, price[i] + dp(next_state))\\n}\\n```  \\n\\n* But we also need to take into consideration the offers we can get from the ```specials[][]``` array\\n* So for each ```off``` array in specials, we can unpack the first n elements as the number of units that we can get and we go up by ```off[-1]```\\n* The second transition is\\n```\\ndp(state) = {\\n\\t            for off in special:\\n                next_state = state[:]\\n                for i in range(n):\\n                    next_state[i] += off[i] #add counts\\n                \\n                ans = min(ans, off[-1] + dp(next_state))\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe cache each state as tuples (you could also use bit masks) but the inputs are small and just take the minimum.

                "content": "# Approach\\nWe have to check for each of the offer , if the offer has less than or equal to the no. of elements in the needs array then we can say it is a valid offer otherwise discard that offer as it has more items than our requirement , and then take minimum of all the costs we got from each of the offers. At the start we have to consider the costs from price array and check if the cost due to actual price array without offers is less if so then take it as minimum. To do this we iterate for each of the offer and check for validity if valid offer then take into account that offer and initiate a recursive call. without memoisation it would give time limit error, this can be avoided using memoisation we can\\'t directly pass array as parameter in case we did for integers like ans[i][j] and so on . So to handle this a string is created from array elements of needs as the needs array keeps on changing, now this string is used as key and passed in a map. so we achieve memoisation using this process. \\n# Code\\n```\\nconst f = (price , needs , offers , ans) => {\\n    let key = \\'\\' \\n    for(let need of needs) key += `_${need}`;\\n    if(ans.has(key)) return ans.get(key);\\n    // console.log({key});\\n    let cost = 0 ; \\n    for(let i=0;i<price.length;i++) cost+= (price[i]*needs[i] ); // in case of no better offers \\n    // looking for better offers than original price \\n    for(let offer of offers) {\\n        let temp = Array.from(needs) , valid = true ;// doing temp = needs create only reference to needs\\n        for(let i=0;i<temp.length;i++){\\n            temp[i]-=offer[i];\\n            if(temp[i]<0) valid = false ; \\n        }\\n        if(valid) cost = Math.min(cost , offer[offer.length-1] + f(price , temp , offers , ans));\\n    }\\n    ans.set(key,cost); \\n    return cost ; \\n}\\nvar shoppingOffers = function(price, offers, needs) {\\n    let ans = new Map() ; \\n    return f(price , needs , offers , ans) ;\\n};\\n\\n\\n```",

This elminates duplicates on not only offers but duplicates also in the form of matching options but different costs.   \\n\\nSet up a valid specials list \\nLoop over each s_ith special \\n- set is valid to True \\n- enumerate needs \\n    - if s_ith[index] > need : is valid is false, break \\n- if is valid is true, append s_i to valid specials \\n\\nThis eliminates immediately invalid specials \\nSet up a shopping trip options as a dictionary of our shopping trip costs\\nSet up backtracking using a needs sublist where some purchases using some specials have already been made.

Let me show you why.\\n\\nIt is stated that you can have at most 6 types of items and you need to buy at most 6 for each one of them. Which mean that there are 7^6=117649 states. It is further stated that there will be at most 100 \"special offers\". That results in 11764900 transitions. Each transition needs 6 multiplications to calculate the index, or comparable work for a hashmap / treemap find. Which basically means a TLE-for-all for the worst case.\\n\\nThe reason that there are lots of 4ms solutions is that the largest test cases are too weak, in a specific way. The special offers in these test cases are too large, containing too many items, so that if you use a DFS or DFS-memo based DP you will only visit a small portion of the 117649 states and you will be fine. In fact, you don\\'t even need DP, because the test sets are really TOO weak. However, if you use an array based DP approach you will get a TLE. A TLE also if you want a uniform and elegent solution and constructs \"offers\" that contains 1 items per type. Of course, if proper strong test cases are provided, all of us will TLE also.\\n\\nThis really doesn\\'t feel right to me, because it is in fact selecting specific implementation technics based on the special traits of the present test sets (prefers DFS to proper DP!), instead of selecting the best algorithms that generally work best.\\n\\nThe constraint of the problem should be lowered to somewhat 5 items and at most 5 each type, and strong test sets should be provided. Such test sets can be constructed by providing all kinds of small special offers, containing 2 or even only 1 items. Or, update the constraint to explicitly state that each special offer will contain at least say 3 or 5 items, so you know that a DFS-based approach will triumph and you should avoid creating 1-item pseudo-offers."

This caused one of the test cases to take `~1300ms` to run. However, if I use the technique in the sample solution to greedily take all the single items once as the first candidate to the solution for a specific set of `needs`, then the same test case runs in `~9ms`. This indicates that the input (`specials`) doesn't contain test data that would break the recursive+memoized solutions.
