More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).\n\n\tFor example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].\n\tSimilarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].\n\tWhile the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.\n\nGiven an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.\nThe replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3]\nOutput: [1,3,2]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [3,2,1]\nOutput: [1,2,3]\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,5]\nOutput: [1,5,1]\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 100\n\t0 <= nums[i] <= 100",

Find the break-point, i: Break-point means the first index i from the back of the given array where arr[i] becomes smaller than arr[i+1].\\nFor example, if the given array is {2,1,5,4,3,0,0}, the break-point will be index 1(0-based indexing). Here from the back of the array, index 1 is the first index where arr[1] i.e. 1 is smaller than arr[i+1] i.e. 5.\\n2. To find the break-point, using a loop we will traverse the array backward and store the index i where arr[i] is less than the value at index (i+1) i.e. arr[i+1].\\nIf such a break-point does not exist i.e. if the array is sorted in decreasing order, the given permutation is the last one in the sorted order of all possible permutations. So, the next permutation must be the first i.e. the permutation in increasing order.\\nSo, in this case, we will reverse the whole array and will return it as our answer.\\n3.

                "content": "First observe that if a list of numbers is in descending order, then there is no lexicographically next greater permutation. Hence `for i in range(n-1,0,-1)`, we search for the first occurrence of i such that `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`. If no such i exists, the list is in descending order, and we use `nums.reverse()` to reverse the list in-place. Otherwise, if such i exists, then `nums[i-1]` will be updated to get the lexicographically next greater permutation. Next, we need to search for the smallest number in `nums[i:]` that\\'s larger than `nums[i-1]`, and swap it with `nums[i-1]`. Note that `nums[i:]` is sorted in descending order. Hence we start with `j = i`, and `while j < n and nums[j] > nums[i-1]`, we do `idx = j, j += 1`. When we are out of the while loop, `nums[idx]` will be the smallest number in `nums[i:]` that\\'s larger than `nums[i]`. We then swap `nums[idx]` and `nums[i-1]`. After the swap, we just need to sort `nums[i:]` in ascending order to get the lexicographically next greater permutation. This can be achieved fairly easily in-place, because `nums[i:]` is already in descending order, and we just need to invert `nums[i:]` in-place to sort `nums[i:]` in ascending order. \\n\\nTo illustrate the algorithm with an example, consider `nums = [2,3,1,5,4,2]`. It is easy to see that `i = 2` is the first i (from the right) such that `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`. Then we swap `nums[2] = 1` with the smallest number in `nums[3:]` that is larger than 1, which is `nums[5] = 2`, after which we get `nums = [2,3,2,5,4,1]`. To get the lexicographically next greater permutation of `nums`, we just need to sort `nums[3:] = [5,4,1]` in-place. Finally, we reach `nums = [2,3,2,1,4,5]`.\\n\\nTime complexity: `O(n)`, space complexity: `O(1)`.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def nextPermutation(self, nums):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type nums: List[int]\\n        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        n = len(nums)\\n        for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\\n            if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:\\n                j = i\\n                while j < n and nums[j] > nums[i-1]:\\n                    idx = j\\n                    j += 1\\n                nums[idx], nums[i-1] = nums[i-1], nums[idx]\\n                for k in range((n-i)//2):\\n                    nums[i+k], nums[n-1-k] = nums[n-1-k], nums[i+k]\\n                break\\n        else:\\n            nums.reverse()\\n```",

If you like this solution or find it useful,* ***please upvote*** *this post.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n***Idea:***\\n\\nChanges made to the left part of an array have more impact on the lexicographical sorting than changes made to the right side, so logically, in order to find the next permutation that is lexicographically greater, we need to find the farthest right-most number that can be swapped for a larger number to its right.\\n\\nWe also then need to make sure that it\\'s not just any larger number, but the *next possible* larger number from the numbers to its right. Then, we\\'ll need to make sure that the remaining numbers to the right of our swapped target are in their lexicographically smallest configuration. (*Think of it like a counter rolling over from **0999** into **1000**.*)\\n\\n---\\n\\n***Implementation:***\\n\\nSo the first order of business is to find the target number we want to swap. As we check from the right to the left, if each number is larger than the one before, then we clearly can\\'t find a lexicographically larger number. Therefore, we have to move left until we find the first time a number is lower than the number to its right.\\n\\nOnce we find that target (**N[i]**), the very important thing to recognize is that the numbers to the target\\'s right are *already* in sorted order, just in the *reverse* order, so we can easily reverse them. (*Even if we don\\'t actually find the target, we still want to reverse the entire array, per the instructions.*)\\n\\nIt\\'s easy then to move from the smallest to largest of the reversed numbers and look for the first number (**N[j]**) that\\'s larger than our target so that we can swap the two. Since **N[j]** is lexicographically nearest to **N[i]**, the subarray to the right of **N[i]** will *still* be in the correct order even after the swap.\\n\\nA simple helper functions to swap array elements will be useful.\\n\\n---\\n\\n***Javascript Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **72ms / 39.3MB** (beats 100% / 100%).\\n```javascript\\nvar nextPermutation = function(N) {\\n    const swap = (a, b) => [N[a],N[b]] = [N[b],N[a]]\\n    let len = N.length - 1, i, j\\n    for (i = len - 1; N[i] >= N[i+1];) i--\\n    for (let k = i+1; len > k; k++, len--) swap(k,len)\\n    if (~i) {\\n        for (j = i + 1; N[i] >= N[j];) j++\\n        swap(i,j)\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Store \\xA0that index into a variable.\\nStep 2: If the index value obtained in step 1 is less than zero. This indicates that the given input array has already been sorted in descending order. Simply reverse the given array to obtain the next permutation. Otherwise, simply traverse the array backwards to find the index that has\\xA0a value greater than the previously found index. Store index in another variable.\\nStep 3: Swap values present in indices found in the above two steps.\\nStep 4: Reverse array from index+1 where the index is found at step 1 till the end of the array.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& arr) {\\n        int n=arr.size(),i,j;\\n        for(i=n-2;i>=0;i--){\\n            if(arr[i]<arr[i+1]) break;\\n        }\\n        if(i<0) reverse(arr.begin(),arr.end());\\n        else{\\n            for(j=n-1; j>=0; j--){\\n                if(arr[j]>arr[i]) break;\\n            }\\n            swap(arr[i],arr[j]);\\n            reverse(arr.begin()+i+1,arr.end());\\n        }\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\nApproach 2: We can simply use the C++ STL library function ```next_permutation()``` to get the next lexicographically greater permutation.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& arr) {\\n        next_permutation(arr.begin(),arr.end());\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\nWhile traversing from backwards we are searching for an element whose value is smaller than the value of its previous element and in each step, we are decrementing the counter i by 1. \\nIf the given array is already sorted in descending order then we will not get a single element.  Eventually, counter i become -1.\\nAs we know to find the next permutation of any integer array which is already sorted in descending order simply take the reverse of it. \\n\\n![sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106552945/188268610-bb25b8c6-65b6-48a8-a3b6-ad652e6ab0d9.jpg)\\n\\n\\nLet me know in comments if you have any doubts.

This is our index1.\\n- If there is no breakpoint that means the array is in descending order. So, simply reverse the full array.\\n- Else again iterate from last and find the element that is great than a[index1]. Store it as index2.\\n- Swap the 2elements at index1 and index2.\\n- Finally reverse the array from index1+1, so that we get the minimum number.

If the given permutation is the largest possible permutation, then the function should return the smallest possible permutation by rearranging the array in ascending order.\\n\\n# Approach:\\nThe algorithm finds the first pair of adjacent elements in the array that satisfy nums[k] < nums[k+1] from the right end of the array. If such a pair does not exist, then the entire array is sorted in descending order, and we need to reverse the entire array to obtain the smallest possible permutation.\\n\\nOtherwise, the algorithm finds the smallest element nums[l] to the right of nums[k] such that nums[l] > nums[k]. We swap nums[k] and nums[l], and then reverse the subarray starting at nums[k+1] to obtain the next lexicographic permutation of the array.\\n\\n# Complexity:\\n- Time complexity: The algorithm performs two passes over the array. The first pass has time complexity O(n), while the second pass also has time complexity O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n).\\n\\n- Space complexity: The algorithm uses constant extra space, hence the space complexity of the algorithm is O(1).\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n# C++\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n = nums.size(), k, l;\\n    \\tfor (k = n - 2; k >= 0; k--) {\\n            if (nums[k] < nums[k + 1]) {\\n                break;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    \\tif (k < 0) {\\n    \\t    reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());\\n    \\t} \\n        else {\\n    \\t    for (l = n - 1; l > k; l--) {\\n                if (nums[l] > nums[k]) {\\n                    break;\\n                }\\n            } \\n    \\t    swap(nums[k], nums[l]);\\n    \\t    reverse(nums.begin() + k + 1, nums.end());\\n        }\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n# JAVA\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {\\n        int n = nums.length, k = n - 2, l = n - 1;\\n        while (k >= 0 && nums[k] >= nums[k + 1]) {\\n            k--;\\n        }\\n        if (k < 0) {\\n            reverse(nums, 0, n - 1);\\n        } else {\\n            while (l > k && nums[l] <= nums[k]) {\\n                l--;\\n            }\\n            swap(nums, k, l);\\n            reverse(nums, k + 1, n - 1);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    private void reverse(int[] nums, int i, int j) {\\n        while (i < j) {\\n            swap(nums, i++, j--);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {\\n        int temp = nums[i];\\n        nums[i] = nums[j];\\n        nums[j] = temp;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Python\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def nextPermutation(self, nums):\\n        n = len(nums)\\n        k, l = n - 2, n - 1\\n        while k >= 0 and nums[k] >= nums[k + 1]:\\n            k -= 1\\n        if k < 0:\\n            nums.reverse()\\n        else:\\n            while l > k and nums[l] <= nums[k]:\\n                l -= 1\\n            nums[k], nums[l] = nums[l], nums[k]\\n            nums[k + 1:n] = reversed(nums[k + 1:n])\\n\\n```\\n---\\n\\n# JavaScript \\n```\\nvar nextPermutation = function(nums) {\\n    let n = nums.length;\\n    let k, l;\\n    for (k = n - 2; k >= 0; k--) {\\n        if (nums[k] < nums[k + 1]) {\\n            break;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    if (k < 0) {\\n        nums.reverse();\\n    } else {\\n        for (l = n - 1; l > k; l--) {\\n            if (nums[l] > nums[k]) {\\n                break;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        [nums[k], nums[l]] = [nums[l], nums[k]];\\n        nums.splice(k + 1, n - k - 1, ...nums.slice(k + 1).reverse());\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```",

Then we reverse the subarray to the right of the swapped element in O(n/2) time.

We then find a just greater number in the right half(already traversed part of the array just now) and swap the dip element with it. As we know if we swap a number greater than the dip element we need the other numbers to be in sorted order in th right half so that the number formed is just greater as the array was already sorted in descending order we just reverse it to get the increasing order.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n    O(N)\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n    O(1)\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {\\n       int i,j,n=nums.size();\\n       for(i=n-2;i>=0;i--)\\n       {\\n           if(nums[i]<nums[i+1])\\n                break;\\n       } \\n       if(i<0)\\n       {\\n           reverse(nums.begin(),nums.end());\\n       }\\n       else\\n       {\\n            for(j=n-1;j>=i;j--)\\n            {\\n                if(nums[j]>nums[i])\\n                    break;\\n            }\\n           swap(nums[i],nums[j]);\\n           reverse(nums.begin()+i+1,nums.end());\\n       }\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "**Solution 1:**\\n\\n**Intuition:**\\n- A permutation is a rearrangement of the members of the sequence into a new sequence. For example, there are `24` permutations of `[a, b, c, d]`; some of these are \\n`[b, a, d, c]`, `[d, a, b, c]`, and `[a, d, b, c]`.\\n- There exists `n!` permutations of `n` elements. These can totally ordered using the dictionary ordering. We define permutation `p` to appear before `q` if in the first place where `p` and `q` differ in their array representations, the corresponding entry for `p` is less than that for `q`.\\nFor example, `[2, 0, 1] < [2, 1, 0]`. Note that permutation `[0, 1, 2]` is the smallest permutation under dictionary ordering, and `[2, 1, 0]` is the largest permutation under dictionary ordering.\\n- Here the algorithm takes a permutation as an input and returns the next permutation under dictionary ordering. \\nFor example, if the input is `[1, 0, 3 ,2]`, then we return `[1, 2, 0, 3]`.\\n- If the input permutation is the last permutation, then we return the first permutation. \\nFor example, if the input is `[4, 3, 2 ,1]`, then we return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.\\n---------------------\\n- The key insight is that we want to increase the permutation by as little as possible. Here we can not change the values, only reorder them. We will use input permutation \\n`[6, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 0]`.\\n- Specifically, we start from the right, and look at the longest decreasing `suffix`, which is `[5, 4, 3, 0]` for our example. We can not get the next permutation just by modifying this `suffix`, since it is already the maximum it can be.\\n- Instead we look at the entry `e` that appears just before the longest decreasing `suffix`, which is `1` in this case. \\n- If there is no such element, i.e., the longest decreasing `suffix` is the entire input permutation, for which the next permutation is the first permutation. In this case we return reverse of input permutation.\\n- Observe that `e` must be less than some entries in `suffix`, since the entry immediately after `e` is greater than `e`. Intuitively, we should swap `e` with the smallest entry `s` in the `suffix` which is larger than `e` so as to minimize the change to the `prefix`, which is defined to the part of the sequence that appears before the `suffix`.\\nFor example, here `e = 1` and `s = 3` Swapping `s` and `e` results in `[6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 0]`.\\n- We are not done yet, since the new `prefix` is the smallest possible for all permutations greater than the initial permutation, but the new `suffix` may not be the smallest. We can get the smallest `suffix` by sorting the entries in the `suffix` from the smallest to largest. For our working example, this yields the `suffix` `[0, 1, 4, 5]`.\\n- As an optimization, it is not necessary to call the full blown sorting algorithm on `suffix`. Since the `suffix` was initially decreasing, and after replacing `s` by `e` it still remains decreasing, reversing the `suffix` has the effect of sorting it from smallest to largest.\\n---------------------\\n\\n**Algorithm:**\\n1. Find the largest index `i` such that `A[i] < A[i + 1]`. If no such index exists, just reverse `A` and done.\\n2. Find the largest index `j` such that `j > i` and `A[i] < A[j]`.\\n3. Swap `A[i]` and `A[j]`.\\n4. Reverse the sequence after position `i`. i.e. the sub-array `A[i + 1, n]`.\\n\\n- For example, given the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is in increasing order, and given that the index is zero-based, the steps are as follows:\\n  1. Index `i = 2`, because `3` is placed at an index that satisfies condition of being the largest index that is still less than `A[i + 1]` which is `4`.\\n  2. Index `j = 3`, because `4` is the only value in the sequence that is greater than `3` in order to satisfy the condition `A[i] < A[j]`.\\n  3. The values of `A[2]` and `A[3]` are swapped to form the new sequence `[1, 2, 4, 3]`.\\n  4. The sequence after `i` index, i.e. `A[2]` to the final element is reversed. Because only one value lies after this index (the `3`), the sequence remains unchanged in this instance. Thus the lexicographic successor of the initial state is permuted as: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`.\\n\\n- Following this algorithm, the next lexicographic permutation will be `[1, 3, 2, 4]`, and the `24`<sup>th</sup> permutation will be `[4, 3, 2, 1]` at which point `A[i] < A[i + 1]` does not exist, indicating that this is the last permutation.\\n\\n**Time complexity:** `O(N)`\\n**Space complexity:** `O(1)`\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void nextPermutation(int[] A) {\\n        int N = A.length;\\n        int i;\\n        int j;\\n\\n        for (i = N - 2; i >= 0; i--) {\\n            if (A[i] < A[i + 1])\\n                break;\\n        }\\n\\n        if (i >= 0) {\\n            for (j = N - 1; j > i; j--) {\\n                if (A[i] < A[j])\\n                    break;\\n            }\\n            swap(A, i, j);\\n        }\\n        reverse(A, i + 1, N - 1);\\n    }\\n\\n    private void reverse(int[] A, int start, int end) {\\n        while (start < end) {\\n            swap(A, start++, end--);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    private void swap(int[] A, int i, int j) {\\n        int temp = A[i];\\n        A[i] = A[j];\\n        A[j] = temp;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Here from the back of the array, index 1 is the first index where arr[1] i.e. 1 is smaller than arr[i+1] i.e. 5.\\nTo find the break-point, using a loop we will traverse the array backward and store the index i where arr[i] is less than the value at index (i+1) i.e. arr[i+1].\\nIf such a break-point does not exist i.e. if the array is sorted in decreasing order, the given permutation is the last one in the sorted order of all possible permutations.

Find all possible permutations of given array `nums`.\\n2. Linearly search for the given permutation.\\n3. Return the very next permutation of the given found permutation.\\n\\n### Time Complexity \\u23F3\\n- **Generating All Permutations:** Generating all permutations of an array with N elements has a time complexity of O(N!). This is because there are N! (N factorial) possible permutations of an array of size N.\\n\\n- **Finding a Particular Arrangement Linearly:** After generating all permutations, you would need to linearly search for a particular arrangement. This search would also take O(N!) time in the worst case because you might need to go through all permutations to find the desired one.\\n\\n- **Returning the Next Permutation of the Found Permutation:** Once you\\'ve found the desired permutation, finding the next permutation of it would also take O(N) time because you need to follow the steps for finding the next permutation on that specific permutation.\\n\\nThus, the time complexity of this approach would be O(N!) due to the generation of all permutations. It\\'s an inefficient approach, especially for large values of N, and is likely to give a **TLE**.\\n\\n### Space Complexity \\uD83D\\uDE80\\nThe space complexity for generating all permutations of an array with N elements is O(N!) because you\\'re storing N! different permutations.\\n\\n# Approach 2: Better Solution (only for cpp users) - Using `next_permutation()` fun\\uD83E\\uDDD0\\n\\n### Approach \\uD83D\\uDEE0\\uFE0F\\nWe can use the `next_permutation()` function. The next_permutation function is a part of the C++ Standard Library\\'s `<algorithm>` header. It\\'s used to generate the next lexicographically greater permutation of a vector.\\n\\n### Time Complexity \\u23F3\\nThe time complexity of the `next_permutation()` function is O(N), where N is the size of the input vector (nums in this case).\\nThe function traverses the vector from right to left to find the first pair of two consecutive elements such that the left element is less than the right element. This operation takes O(N) time in the worst case.\\nThe subsequent operations, such as finding the smallest greater element and reversing the subarray, also take O(N) time in total.\\nSo, the overall time complexity is O(N).\\n\\n### Space Complexity \\uD83D\\uDE80\\nThe next_permutation function operates in-place and does not use any additional memory that scales with the input size. Therefore, the space complexity of the nextPermutation function is O(1), which means it uses constant extra memory.\\n\\n### Code \\uD83D\\uDCBB\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        next_permutation(nums.begin(),nums.end());\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n# Approach 3: Optimized Solution \\uD83E\\uDDD0\\n\\n### Approach \\uD83D\\uDEE0\\uFE0F\\n- Like in a dictionary the very next word to a given word is almost the same except for a very few alphabets, e.g. in a dictionary Fire would come after fira. Notice how the first three alphabets are the same?\\n- Observing this lexicographical order in an English dictionary, we apply a similar approach in the array as well.\\n- Given array `nums` we find a **break point**. What is a breakpoint exactly and why are we finding it?\\n- Notice that the next permutation of [1,2,5,4,3,0] -> [1,3,5,4,2,0] -> [1,3,0,2,4,5]. Observe how two numbers have been swapped( 2 and 3) first, and then the rest of the array is reversed.\\n- This is because 2 is a breakpoint. A breakpoint here refers to a point that is lesser than the next element in the array.\\n- We traverse `nums` starting from i=n-2th index. We compare each `nums[i]` with `nums[i+1]`. If at any index `i`, `nums[i]`<`nums[i+1]`, we set `i` as out `breakindex` variable.\\n- Now after we\\'ve found the `breakindex`, we traverse the right half of the `nums` array after `breakindex`, so from `i=n-1` till `i=breakpint+1`, and look for the least greater after the `breakpoint`.\\n- In the array example taken above, index 1 was the `breakindex` and we traverse from element 5 to 0 and find that 3 is the least element greater than 1 in that portion of the array.\\n- Now, we swap the `breakindex` element with this `leastgreat` index element.\\n- Now we reverse the array from `breakindex+1` to `n-1`.\\n-**Edge case:** It may happen that the array in the input is the last possible maximum permutation possible for the elements like: [5,4,3,3,2,0], so the next permutation will be the reverse of it which is the first smallest possible permutation of the elements. So in case we do not find a `breakpoint` like in this case, we simply reverse the given `nums` array.\\n\\n### Time Complexity \\u23F3\\nThe time complexity of this approach is linear. We traverse the array twice: first to find the `breakpoint` and then to find the least greater element. Each traversal takes O(N) time.tore indices and values.\\n\\n### Space Complexity \\uD83D\\uDE80\\nThe space complexity is constant O(1) because the algorithm operates in-place without using any additional data structures that scale with the input size. \\n\\n### Code \\uD83D\\uDCBB\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        //find the breakpoint\\n        int breakpoint=-1;\\n        int n=nums.size();\\n        for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--){\\n          if(nums[i]<nums[i+1]){\\n            breakpoint=i;\\n            break;\\n          }  \\n        } \\n        if(breakpoint==-1){reverse(nums.begin(),nums.end());return;}\\n        \\n        //find least greater of element at the breakpoint\\n        int leastgreater=-1; \\n        int leastGvalue=101;\\n        for(int i=n-1;i>breakpoint;i--){\\n            if(nums[i]>nums[breakpoint]){\\n                if(nums[i]<leastGvalue){\\n                    leastgreater=i;\\n                    leastGvalue=nums[i];\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        //now swap breakpoint with leastgreater\\n        swap(nums[breakpoint],nums[leastgreater]);\\n        \\n        //reverse everything after the breakpoint\\n        reverse(nums.begin()+breakpoint+1,nums.end());\\nreturn;\\n}\\n};\\n```\\n\\n![CAN YOU PLEASE UPVOTE.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/fc2c0af7-4f47-44cf-b680-292fe4f08da0_1695449550.2816818.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n",

Similarily in [2 1 3], the next permutation will be    [2 3 1]--->2<3>1.\\n* The only time this won\\'t apply is when the given input is in decreasing order.\\n\\n1. So, we can traverse from back and check for the index position whose value is lesser than its prior index position\\'s value. Let\\'s store it in a variable--idx1.\\n2. Next, we have to again traverse from back and check which value is greater than the idx1 position value. Swap the places to get the possible next greater element.\\n3. However, this swap will only ensure the correctness of breakpoint. We need to then, reverse the rest array elements to the right side of the breakpoint in order to find the next permutation.\\n\\n**Edge case**\\nWhen the given array is in decreasing order, the next permutation will be the same array in reverse order. So in that case we can simply just reverse the entire array. For e.g. [3 2 1] --> [1 2 3].\\n\\n**Happy Hunting**",

Because the numbers to the right of ```nums[i]``` are in descending order, so we can\\'t make that part bigger.\\n2. Now we need to backward traverse the array again to find first number ```nums[j]``` such that ```nums[j] > nums[i]```, and then swap them to generate a bigger number.  \\n\\t* Why do we need to find the **first** ```nums[j]```? Because we need to generate the **smallest** permutation that is greater than the original number.\\n3.  After swapping ```nums[i]``` and ```nums[j]```, we need to reverse the numbers to the right of ```nums[i]``` to force this part to be the smallest. \\n\\t* Why do we use reverse rather than sort? Sorting will work as well. However, swapping ```nums[i]``` and ```nums[j]``` doesn\\'t change the fact that the numbers to the right of ```nums[i]``` are still in descending order.

A decreasing array is the last permutation of the array, and the \\n               next one is the reverse of it. For example, `3,2,1` is the last \\n               permutation of this array and `1,2,3` will be next.\\n            2. For a decreasing subarray, there is a number right before the \\n               subarray that \"leads\" the subarray, e.g., `2,4,3,1` in which `2` \\n               \"leads\" the subarray `4,3,1`. Similarly, the decreasing subarray \\n               is the last permutation of itself, and the next one should be \\n               mostly the reverse of the subarray, except that the \"leading\" \\n               number is going to change. Looking at the previous example, the \\n               next permutation is `3,1,2,4` wherein the \"leading\" number is \\n               `3`, which is the next greater number than `2` in the sequence. \\n               Herein, the rule for generating the next permutation for a \\n               subarray is - 1) swap the \"leading\" number and the next greater \\n               one in the decreasing subarray; 2) reverse the decreasing \\n               subarray.\\n        In summary, the whole process should be the following:\\n            1.

A decreasing array is the last permutation of the array, and the \\n               next one is the reverse of it. For example, `3,2,1` is the last \\n               permutation of this array and `1,2,3` will be next.\\n            2. For a decreasing subarray, there is a number right before the \\n               subarray that \"leads\" the subarray, e.g., `2,4,3,1` in which `2` \\n               \"leads\" the subarray `4,3,1`. Similarly, the decreasing subarray \\n               is the last permutation of itself, and the next one should be \\n               mostly the reverse of the subarray, except that the \"leading\" \\n               number is going to change. Looking at the previous example, the \\n               next permutation is `3,1,2,4` wherein the \"leading\" number is \\n               `3`, which is the next greater number than `2` in the sequence. \\n               Herein, the rule for generating the next permutation for a \\n               subarray is - 1) swap the \"leading\" number and the next greater \\n               one in the decreasing subarray; 2) reverse the decreasing \\n               subarray.\\n        In summary, the whole process should be the following:\\n            1. Find the decreasing subarray if not the entire array\\n            2.

Thus if you are looking for a solution that requires ***less algorithm skills but more thinking***, here is your place.\\n\\n# Code (!the explanation etc. is below this section!)\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void swapAB(int &a, int &b){\\n        int tmp = a;\\n        a = b;\\n        b = tmp;\\n    }\\n    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        \\n        // if it\\'s the last permutation\\n        bool flag = true;\\n        for(int i=1; i<nums.size(); i++){\\n            if(nums[i] > nums[i-1]){\\n                flag = false;\\n                break;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        if(flag == true){\\n            sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());\\n            return;\\n        }\\n\\n        // if it\\'s not the last permutation\\n        int lastIndex = nums.size()-1;\\n        while(nums[lastIndex-1] >= nums[lastIndex])\\n            lastIndex --;\\n        lastIndex --;\\n\\n        int mid = 101, midIdx = lastIndex;\\n        for(int i=lastIndex+1; i<nums.size(); i++){\\n            if(nums[i] <= mid && nums[i] > nums[lastIndex]){\\n                mid = nums[i];\\n                midIdx = i;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        swap(nums[lastIndex], nums[midIdx]);\\n\\n        for(int i=lastIndex+1, j=nums.size()-1; i<j; i++, j--)\\n            if(nums[i] > nums[j]) swap(nums[i], nums[j]);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n# Approach\\nLet us use a couple of examples to help us understand how to get the next permutation.\\nThis is how you find the next permutation:\\n\\n1. 5 4 3 2 1 -> [5 4 3 2 1] ---------------> 1 2 3 4 5 (special case)\\n2. 1 2 3 4 5 -> 1 2 3 4 [5] -> 1 2 **4** [5 3] -> 1 2 4 **3 5**\\n3. 1 3 5 4 2 -> 1 3 [5 4 2] -> 1 **4** [5 3 2] -> 1 4 **2 3 5**\\n4. 1 5 4 3 2 -> 1 [5 4 3 2] -> **2** [5 4 3 1] -> 2 **1 3 4 5**\\n\\nEx1 is **special**, so let us tryna solve case 2-4 first.\\n\\n- The first \"arrow\" represents **finding the longest decending array at the end of the nums**. We temporarily call this decending array as \"The ***queue***\".\\n- The second \"arrow\" represents **replace the num before the queue with the smallest number in the queue that is greater than this number**.\\n- The third \"arrow\" means **sorting the queue**. As the original queue is decending and the replaced number is still in place, we only need to **reverse the whole queue**.\\n\\nNow you know how my solution works. Why it works is just generally how to find the next permutation, you can notice how it works if you print out all the permutations and observe the pattern in it.\\n\\nThe code for this part is\\n```\\n// step one / first \"->\"\\nint lastIndex = nums.size()-1;\\nwhile(nums[lastIndex-1] >= nums[lastIndex])\\n    lastIndex --;\\nlastIndex --;\\n// step two / second \"->\"\\nint mid = 101, midIdx = lastIndex;\\nfor(int i=lastIndex+1; i<nums.size(); i++){\\n    if(nums[i] <= mid && nums[i] > nums[lastIndex]){\\n        mid = nums[i];\\n        midIdx = i;\\n    }\\n}\\nswap(nums[lastIndex], nums[midIdx]);\\n// step three / third \"->\"\\nfor(int i=lastIndex+1, j=nums.size()-1; i<j; i++, j--)\\n    if(nums[i] > nums[j]) swap(nums[i], nums[j]);\\n```\\n\\nNow for the special case. Our Ex1 is special is **Thoroughly Decending**, the next permutation is the sorted permutation. Hence, we need an \"if\" statement to watch out for this case, the code is below:\\n```\\nbool flag = true; // keep track of whether it\\'s decending overall\\nfor(int i=1; i<nums.size(); i++){\\n    if(nums[i] > nums[i-1]){\\n        flag = false;\\n        break;\\n    }\\n}\\nif(flag == true){\\n    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());\\n    return; // remember to return here to keep the nums sorted!\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThere you have it. This is my answer to this problem!\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(N) when it\\'s detecting the special case\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1) only some parameters to keep track of info\\n",

This element is the first candidate for swapping.\\n\\n- It simply means that if we have a number that is greater that number nums[i] on the right we can get an array that is greater (lexicographically ordering of elements) than the current number and as the permutation are in lexicographical order we can get our next permutation just by manipulating the elements on the right side.\\n\\n- If no such element is found (i.e., if i becomes -1), it means that the list is in descending order, and there is no greater permutation possible. In this case, reverse the entire list to obtain the smallest permutation and return it.\\n\\n- If you found an element to swap (i.e., i is not -1), proceed to find the smallest element to the right of nums[i] that is just greater than nums[i]. This is done by traversing the list again from right to left and stopping when you find an element greater than nums[i]. Let\\'s call this element nums[j].\\n\\n- Swap nums[i] and nums[j] to get the array that will have greater value.Like in [1,2,3,2,1] doing above steps will get us to [1,3,2,2,1].Since we got our array greater by just with index (i), the value of array on the right side of (i) must be lowest to get the next permutation.\\n\\n- Finally, sort the elements to the right of nums[i] in ascending order to ensure you have the next greater permutation.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n  void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {\\n    int n = nums.size(), i = n - 2;\\n    while(i >= 0 && nums[i] >= nums[i + 1])i--;\\n    if(i < 0){\\n      reverse(nums.begin() + i + 1, nums.end());\\n      return;\\n    }\\n    int j = n - 1;\\n    while(j > i && nums[j] <= nums[i])j--;\\n    swap(nums[i], nums[j]);\\n    sort(nums.begin() + i + 1, nums.end());\\n  }\\n};\\n\\n\\n```",

The only number available is 3 so we use 3 as our next number. our arrangement is now:\\n [1,3,x].  \\n next we repeat the process with finding the smallest of the available numbers: which is only 2. so we then have:\\n [1,3,2].\\n We mark this as the next complete arrangement and we again backtrack a level:\\n [1,x,x].\\n This time we have used all available numbers in this position, so we have no numbers left to use here.\\n because of this we backtrack again and end back at the starting position:\\n [x,x,x].\\n The only number we cannot use as the next position is 1, as it was already used here. of the remaining\\n available numbers, 2 is the next smallest. So, we place 2 next and our arrangement is now:\\n [2,x,x].\\n The next is:\\n [2,1,x].\\n where we get the next complete arrangement of:\\n [2,1,3].\\n\\n This process repeats just like above until you run out of numbers and there is no place to backtrack to.\\n The longer the array the longer it takes this process to complete, this is just a simple example.\\n"

The only number available is 3 so we use 3 as our next number. our arrangement is now:\\n [1,3,x].  \\n next we repeat the process with finding the smallest of the available numbers: which is only 2. so we then have:\\n [1,3,2].\\n We mark this as the next complete arrangement and we again backtrack a level:\\n [1,x,x].\\n This time we have used all available numbers in this position, so we have no numbers left to use here.\\n because of this we backtrack again and end back at the starting position:\\n [x,x,x].\\n The only number we cannot use as the next position is 1, as it was already used here. of the remaining\\n available numbers, 2 is the next smallest. So, we place 2 next and our arrangement is now:\\n [2,x,x].\\n The next is:\\n [2,1,x].\\n where we get the next complete arrangement of:\\n [2,1,3].\\n\\n This process repeats just like above until you run out of numbers and there is no place to backtrack to.\\n The longer the array the longer it takes this process to complete, this is just a simple example.\\n"

So, we place 2 next and our arrangement is now:\\n [2,x,x].\\n The next is:\\n [2,1,x].\\n where we get the next complete arrangement of:\\n [2,1,3].\\n\\n This process repeats just like above until you run out of numbers and there is no place to backtrack to.\\n The longer the array the longer it takes this process to complete, this is just a simple example.\\n"

The only number available is 3 so we use 3 as our next number. our arrangement is now:\\n [1,3,x].  \\n next we repeat the process with finding the smallest of the available numbers: which is only 2. so we then have:\\n [1,3,2].\\n We mark this as the next complete arrangement and we again backtrack a level:\\n [1,x,x].\\n This time we have used all available numbers in this position, so we have no numbers left to use here.\\n because of this we backtrack again and end back at the starting position:\\n [x,x,x].\\n The only number we cannot use as the next position is 1, as it was already used here. of the remaining\\n available numbers, 2 is the next smallest. So, we place 2 next and our arrangement is now:\\n [2,x,x].\\n The next is:\\n [2,1,x].\\n where we get the next complete arrangement of:\\n [2,1,3].\\n\\n This process repeats just like above until you run out of numbers and there is no place to backtrack to.\\n The longer the array the longer it takes this process to complete, this is just a simple example.\\n"

Now think of this array as just numbers. 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.\\nAll the numbers are also in ascending order. So to find the next permutation of 123 in lexicographic order is 132. Also the next permutation of 213 is 231. Also the next permutation of 321 is ... As we know there is no permutation after that. so just sort 321 in ascending order and the answer is 123.\\nSo basically if we are given a number return just a number which is greater than it. but not too greater.

                        "content": "The problem involves finding the next lexicographically greater permutation of an array of integers. Let's break it down into simpler terms.\n\nImagine you have an array of numbers, and you need to rearrange the elements in such a way that you get the next greater permutation. By \"next greater permutation,\" we mean the arrangement of numbers that comes immediately after the current arrangement in lexicographical order.\n\nTo understand lexicographical order, think of it as the order you would find words in a dictionary. For example, \"apple\" comes before \"banana\" because \"a\" comes before \"b\" in the alphabet.\n\nHere's an example: let's say we have an array [1, 2, 3]. The permutations of this array are [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1]. If we sort these permutations in lexicographical order, the order would be [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].\n\nTo find the next permutation, you need to rearrange the numbers in such a way that you get the smallest possible permutation that is greater than the current one. If there is no such permutation, you should return the smallest possible permutation (i.e., the sorted array).\n\nFor example, given the array [1, 2, 3], the next permutation is [1, 3, 2]. This is because [1, 3, 2] is the smallest permutation greater than [1, 2, 3]. Similarly, the next permutation of [2, 3, 1] is [3, 1, 2]. However, for [3, 2, 1], there is no lexicographically greater arrangement possible, so we return [1, 2, 3] because it is the smallest possible permutation.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to implement an algorithm that finds the next permutation in place, meaning you modify the given array itself without using any extra memory.\n\nThe constraints state that the length of the array will be between 1 and 100, and the elements will be between 0 and 100.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the problem better!"

Let's break it down into simpler terms.\n\nImagine you have an array of numbers, and you need to rearrange the elements in such a way that you get the next greater permutation. By \"next greater permutation,\" we mean the arrangement of numbers that comes immediately after the current arrangement in lexicographical order.\n\nTo understand lexicographical order, think of it as the order you would find words in a dictionary. For example, \"apple\" comes before \"banana\" because \"a\" comes before \"b\" in the alphabet.\n\nHere's an example: let's say we have an array [1, 2, 3]. The permutations of this array are [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1]. If we sort these permutations in lexicographical order, the order would be [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].\n\nTo find the next permutation, you need to rearrange the numbers in such a way that you get the smallest possible permutation that is greater than the current one. If there is no such permutation, you should return the smallest possible permutation (i.e., the sorted array).\n\nFor example, given the array [1, 2, 3], the next permutation is [1, 3, 2]. This is because [1, 3, 2] is the smallest permutation greater than [1, 2, 3]. Similarly, the next permutation of [2, 3, 1] is [3, 1, 2]. However, for [3, 2, 1], there is no lexicographically greater arrangement possible, so we return [1, 2, 3] because it is the smallest possible permutation.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to implement an algorithm that finds the next permutation in place, meaning you modify the given array itself without using any extra memory.\n\nThe constraints state that the length of the array will be between 1 and 100, and the elements will be between 0 and 100.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the problem better!"

Let's break it down into simpler terms.\n\nImagine you have an array of numbers, and you need to rearrange the elements in such a way that you get the next greater permutation. By \"next greater permutation,\" we mean the arrangement of numbers that comes immediately after the current arrangement in lexicographical order.\n\nTo understand lexicographical order, think of it as the order you would find words in a dictionary. For example, \"apple\" comes before \"banana\" because \"a\" comes before \"b\" in the alphabet.\n\nHere's an example: let's say we have an array [1, 2, 3]. The permutations of this array are [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1]. If we sort these permutations in lexicographical order, the order would be [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].\n\nTo find the next permutation, you need to rearrange the numbers in such a way that you get the smallest possible permutation that is greater than the current one. If there is no such permutation, you should return the smallest possible permutation (i.e., the sorted array).\n\nFor example, given the array [1, 2, 3], the next permutation is [1, 3, 2]. This is because [1, 3, 2] is the smallest permutation greater than [1, 2, 3]. Similarly, the next permutation of [2, 3, 1] is [3, 1, 2]. However, for [3, 2, 1], there is no lexicographically greater arrangement possible, so we return [1, 2, 3] because it is the smallest possible permutation.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to implement an algorithm that finds the next permutation in place, meaning you modify the given array itself without using any extra memory.\n\nThe constraints state that the length of the array will be between 1 and 100, and the elements will be between 0 and 100.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the problem better!"

Let's break it down into simpler terms.\n\nImagine you have an array of numbers, and you need to rearrange the elements in such a way that you get the next greater permutation. By \"next greater permutation,\" we mean the arrangement of numbers that comes immediately after the current arrangement in lexicographical order.\n\nTo understand lexicographical order, think of it as the order you would find words in a dictionary. For example, \"apple\" comes before \"banana\" because \"a\" comes before \"b\" in the alphabet.\n\nHere's an example: let's say we have an array [1, 2, 3]. The permutations of this array are [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1]. If we sort these permutations in lexicographical order, the order would be [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].\n\nTo find the next permutation, you need to rearrange the numbers in such a way that you get the smallest possible permutation that is greater than the current one. If there is no such permutation, you should return the smallest possible permutation (i.e., the sorted array).\n\nFor example, given the array [1, 2, 3], the next permutation is [1, 3, 2]. This is because [1, 3, 2] is the smallest permutation greater than [1, 2, 3]. Similarly, the next permutation of [2, 3, 1] is [3, 1, 2]. However, for [3, 2, 1], there is no lexicographically greater arrangement possible, so we return [1, 2, 3] because it is the smallest possible permutation.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to implement an algorithm that finds the next permutation in place, meaning you modify the given array itself without using any extra memory.\n\nThe constraints state that the length of the array will be between 1 and 100, and the elements will be between 0 and 100.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the problem better!"

Let's break it down into simpler terms.\n\nImagine you have an array of numbers, and you need to rearrange the elements in such a way that you get the next greater permutation. By \"next greater permutation,\" we mean the arrangement of numbers that comes immediately after the current arrangement in lexicographical order.\n\nTo understand lexicographical order, think of it as the order you would find words in a dictionary. For example, \"apple\" comes before \"banana\" because \"a\" comes before \"b\" in the alphabet.\n\nHere's an example: let's say we have an array [1, 2, 3]. The permutations of this array are [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1]. If we sort these permutations in lexicographical order, the order would be [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].\n\nTo find the next permutation, you need to rearrange the numbers in such a way that you get the smallest possible permutation that is greater than the current one. If there is no such permutation, you should return the smallest possible permutation (i.e., the sorted array).\n\nFor example, given the array [1, 2, 3], the next permutation is [1, 3, 2]. This is because [1, 3, 2] is the smallest permutation greater than [1, 2, 3]. Similarly, the next permutation of [2, 3, 1] is [3, 1, 2]. However, for [3, 2, 1], there is no lexicographically greater arrangement possible, so we return [1, 2, 3] because it is the smallest possible permutation.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to implement an algorithm that finds the next permutation in place, meaning you modify the given array itself without using any extra memory.\n\nThe constraints state that the length of the array will be between 1 and 100, and the elements will be between 0 and 100.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the problem better!"

Now think of this array as just numbers. 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.\\nAll the numbers are also in ascending order. So to find the next permutation of 123 in lexicographic order is 132. Also the next permutation of 213 is 231. Also the next permutation of 321 is ... As we know there is no permutation after that. so just sort 321 in ascending order and the answer is 123.\\nSo basically if we are given a number return just a number which is greater than it. but not too greater. ( a number which is next greater to it ).\\nNow let\\'s get back to the question.\\nTake the example [1,2,3] . We can just check from the end to start for an index i where arr[i] > arr[i + 1]. In this example we will have 3. In the same way starting from end to i + 1; find an index j where arr[j] > arr[i]. In this example we will have 2. Now we have 2 indexes. Swap the two elements. so arr becomes [1,3,2]. For this example we got the answer here. but we also need to reverse the elements from i + 1 to end. Here the elements to be reversed are from i + 1 to end. In that way you will have the next greater element.\\n(Try with a array with more that 3 elements and you will understand why we need to reverse the elements.)"

                        "content": "The problem involves finding the next lexicographically greater permutation of an array of integers. Let's break it down into simpler terms.\n\nImagine you have an array of numbers, and you need to rearrange the elements in such a way that you get the next greater permutation. By \"next greater permutation,\" we mean the arrangement of numbers that comes immediately after the current arrangement in lexicographical order.\n\nTo understand lexicographical order, think of it as the order you would find words in a dictionary. For example, \"apple\" comes before \"banana\" because \"a\" comes before \"b\" in the alphabet.\n\nHere's an example: let's say we have an array [1, 2, 3]. The permutations of this array are [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1]. If we sort these permutations in lexicographical order, the order would be [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].\n\nTo find the next permutation, you need to rearrange the numbers in such a way that you get the smallest possible permutation that is greater than the current one. If there is no such permutation, you should return the smallest possible permutation (i.e., the sorted array).\n\nFor example, given the array [1, 2, 3], the next permutation is [1, 3, 2]. This is because [1, 3, 2] is the smallest permutation greater than [1, 2, 3]. Similarly, the next permutation of [2, 3, 1] is [3, 1, 2]. However, for [3, 2, 1], there is no lexicographically greater arrangement possible, so we return [1, 2, 3] because it is the smallest possible permutation.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to implement an algorithm that finds the next permutation in place, meaning you modify the given array itself without using any extra memory.\n\nThe constraints state that the length of the array will be between 1 and 100, and the elements will be between 0 and 100.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the problem better!"

Here if you want to get all the possible palindrome partition, first a nested for loop to get every possible partitions for a string, then a scanning for all the partitions.  That's a O(n^2) for partition and O(n^2) for the scanning of string, totaling at O(n^4) just for the partition.  However, if we use a 2d array to keep track of any string we have scanned so far, with an addition pair, we can determine whether it's palindrome or not by justing looking at that pair, which is this line `if(s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) && (i - j <= 2 || dp[j+1][i-1]))`.  This way, the 2d array `dp` contains the possible palindrome partition among all.  \\n\\nsecond, based on the prescanned palindrome partitions saved in dp array, a simple backtrack does the job.\\n\\n    public class Solution {\\n        public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {\\n            List<List<String>> res = new ArrayList<>();\\n            boolean[][] dp = new boolean[s.length()][s.length()];\\n            for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\\n                for(int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {\\n                    if(s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) && (i - j <= 2 || dp[j+1][i-1])) {\\n                        dp[j][i] = true;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n            helper(res, new ArrayList<>(), dp, s, 0);\\n            return res;\\n        }\\n        \\n        private void helper(List<List<String>> res, List<String> path, boolean[][] dp, String s, int pos) {\\n            if(pos == s.length()) {\\n                res.add(new ArrayList<>(path));\\n                return;\\n            }\\n            \\n            for(int i = pos; i < s.length(); i++) {\\n                if(dp[pos][i]) {\\n                    path.add(s.substring(pos,i+1));\\n                    helper(res, path, dp, s, i+1);\\n                    path.remove(path.size()-1);\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }",

Where i can have the first partition.\\n\\nBut, if they don\\'t allow to partition over there, then our second partition will be xx|yy. Because this \"xx\" is a palindrome substring. Thus we still left out with yy, so if i do the partion over here xxy|y the answer will be no, because if i do the partition over here the substring \"xxy\" is not a palindrome.\\n\\nCan i do a partition over here xxyy|. No. Because xxyy is not a palindromic substring. So, we can see when we started we can do a partition over here x|xyy OR xx|yy so that is what we do. We try to do partition where ever it is possible\\n\\nSo, in the first case we did a partition over x|xyy where we left out with xyy. So, if i do a partiton like x|x|yy where x it\\'self a palindrome. And we left out with a substring yy\\nNow can you do a partition over here x|xy|y. No, because this substring xy is not a palindrome\\nAgain can we do a partition over here x|xyy|. No, because this substring xyy is not a palindrome\\n\\nSo, the only partition possible is x|x|yy. And after that we tend to call the recursion for remaining substring\\n\\nIf i try to do a partition over here x|x|y|y so, the substring y in itself is a palindromic substring. After that we left out with remaining y substring.\\nNow you ask can we do a partition over here x|x|yy|, Yes \\n\\nLike this way, we do the partition in complete STRING using recursion. And with the help of Backtracking we store our answer.\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/104d7464-a56c-45c3-87cc-4caea3a05103_1641347225.9497328.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/f091240a-0866-4fcb-b774-416cdc7dc560_1641347244.659475.png)\\n\\n*h means, helper function* \\n**JAVA**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {\\n        List<List<String>> res = new ArrayList<>(); // which will be our answer\\n        List<String> path = new ArrayList<>(); // as we are generating list everythime, so at the end this will be our list\\n        helper(0, s, path, res); // calling to recursion function start from index 0 and string s\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n    // Entire recursive function, that generates all the partition substring\\n    public void helper(int index, String s, List<String> path, List<List<String>> res){\\n        // Base Condition, which means when we have done partition at the end (n), then add it to our ultimate result\\n        if(index == s.length()){\\n            res.add(new ArrayList<>(path));\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        // Let\\'s talk about partition\\n        for(int i = index; i < s.length(); i++){\\n            if(isPalindrome(s, index, i)){ // what we are checking over here is, if we partition the string from index to i Example-(0, 0) is palindrome or not\\n                path.add(s.substring(index, i + 1)); // take the substring and store it in our list & call the next substring from index + 1\\n                helper(i + 1, s, path, res); // as we have done for (0, 0) then our next will be from (1)\\n                path.remove(path.size() - 1); // please make sure you remove when you backtrack. \\n                // Why?

                "content": "The problem has a nice structure that backtracking naturally fits in. The structure is, given a starting position `start`, we search from `start` till the end of the string. Once we reach a position `i` such that the sub-string from `start` to `i` (`s.substr(start, i  - start + 1)`) is a palindrome, we add it to a temporary `par`. Then we recursively call the same function to process the remaining sub-string. Once we reach the end of the string, we add `par` into the result `pars` of all the possible partitioning.\\n \\nThen, backtracking happens. Remember that at position `i`, we find `s.substr(start, i - start + 1)` to be a palindrome and we immediately add it to `par`. It is obvious that there may be some other position `j` such that `j > i` and `s.substr(start, j - start + 1)` is also a palindrome. So we need to recover to the state before adding `s.substr(start, i - start + 1)` to `par` and continue to find the next palindrome position after `i`. And we simply need to pop `s.substr(start, i - start + 1)` out of `par` to make things work.  \\n \\nPutting these together, the code is as follows, which should be self-explanatory.\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        vector<vector<string>> pars;\\n        vector<string> par;\\n        partition(s, 0, par, pars);\\n        return pars;\\n    }\\nprivate: \\n    void partition(string& s, int start, vector<string>& par, vector<vector<string>>& pars) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        if (start == n) {\\n            pars.push_back(par);\\n        } else {\\n            for (int i = start; i < n; i++) {\\n                if (isPalindrome(s, start, i)) {\\n                    par.push_back(s.substr(start, i - start + 1));\\n                    partition(s, i + 1, par, pars);\\n                    par.pop_back();\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    bool isPalindrome(string& s, int l, int r) {\\n        while (l < r) {\\n            if (s[l++] != s[r--]) {\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

This function checks if the substring of the string from start index to end index is a palindrome or not.\\n2. Create a function called \"palindromePartition\" that takes in an index, a vector of strings, a 2D vector of strings, and a string as parameters. This function partitions the given string into all possible palindrome partitions.\\n3. In the \"palindromePartition\" function, check if the current index is equal to the length of the string. If it is, add the current partition to the output vector and return.\\n4. Iterate from the current index to the end of the string.\\n5. For each iteration, check if the substring from current index to the current iterator is a palindrome using the \"checkPalindrome\" function.\\n6. If it is a palindrome, add it to the partition vector and recursively call the \"palindromePartition\" function with the updated partition and the next index.\\n7. After the recursive call, remove the last element from the partition vector.\\n8. Return the output vector after all partitions have been found.\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool checkPalindrome(string str, int startIndex, int lastIndex){\\n        while(startIndex <= lastIndex){\\n            if(str[startIndex] != str[lastIndex])\\n                return false;\\n            startIndex++;\\n            lastIndex--;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    void palindromePartition(int index, vector<string>& ds, vector<vector<string>>& output, string str){\\n        if(index == str.length()){\\n            output.push_back(ds);\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        for(int i = index; i < str.length(); i++){\\n            if(checkPalindrome(str, index, i)){\\n                ds.push_back(str.substr(index, i - index + 1));\\n                palindromePartition(i+1, ds, output, str);\\n                ds.pop_back();\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        vector<vector<string>> output;\\n        vector<string> ds;\\n        palindromePartition(0, ds, output, s);\\n        return output;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean checkPalindrome(String str, int startIndex, int lastIndex){\\n        while(startIndex <= lastIndex){\\n            if(str.charAt(startIndex) != str.charAt(lastIndex))\\n                return false;\\n            startIndex++;\\n            lastIndex--;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    public void palindromePartition(int index, List<String> ds, List<List<String>> output, String str){\\n        if(index == str.length()){\\n            output.add(new ArrayList<>(ds));\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        for(int i = index; i < str.length(); i++){\\n            if(checkPalindrome(str, index, i)){\\n                ds.add(str.substring(index, i + 1));\\n                palindromePartition(i+1, ds, output, str);\\n                ds.remove(ds.size()-1);\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {\\n        List<List<String>> output = new ArrayList<>();\\n        List<String> ds = new ArrayList<>();\\n        palindromePartition(0, ds, output, s);\\n        return output;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n```Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def checkPalindrome(self, str, startIndex, lastIndex):\\n        while startIndex <= lastIndex:\\n            if str[startIndex] != str[lastIndex]:\\n                return False\\n            startIndex += 1\\n            lastIndex -= 1\\n        return True\\n\\n    def palindromePartition(self, index, ds, output, str):\\n        if index == len(str):\\n            output.append(ds[:])\\n            return\\n        for i in range(index, len(str)):\\n            if self.checkPalindrome(str, index, i):\\n                ds.append(str[index:i+1])\\n                self.palindromePartition(i+1, ds, output, str)\\n                ds.pop()\\n\\n    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:\\n        output = []\\n        ds = []\\n        self.palindromePartition(0, ds, output, s)\\n        return output\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: **O(2^n*n)**\\nThe time complexity is O(2^n) because for each character in the input string, the algorithm generates two recursive calls, one for including the character in the current partition and one for not including it. Since the input string can have up to n characters, this results in 2^n possible partitions. The algorithm must check each partition to see if it is a palindrome, and therefore the time complexity is O(2^n)and O(N) time to generate the substring and determine if it is a palindrome or not. So overall time complexity is O(2^n*n).\\n\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: **O(n)**\\nThe space complexity is O(n) because the algorithm uses a single vector to store the current partition. The size of the vector is directly proportional to the number of characters in the input string and therefore the space complexity is O(n). Additionally, the algorithm uses a 2D vector to store all the partitions, the size of this vector also increase linearly as the size of the input string increase, so the space complexity is O(n).\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->",

                "content": "**Reframing the question:-**\\nFind all the substrings which satisfies the palindrome condition of given string s.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Intuition:-**\\n* The structure of the question is quite clear that it **promotes the use of recursion** . The recursion approach of this question can be like:  we start iteration from beginning and step by step we increase the size of substr that we are checking for palindromes . Once the palindrome substr is found ,the substr needs to go to a vector/list storing those palindromes substr . This is how the brute recursion will work .\\n* The **optimization** of the above recursion is **backtracking**. \\nA **backtracking algorithm uses the depth-first search method**. When it starts exploring the solutions, a bounding or a helper function is applied so that the **algorithm can check if the so-far built solution satisfies the constraints**. If it does, it continues searching. If it doesn\\u2019t, the branch would be eliminated, and the algorithm goes back to the level before. In simple words backtracking starts from some intermediate position where there is still a hope to get a new palindrome .\\n* In backtracking algo there is **always a helper metod** or a safe checker merhod which checks whether the built soution satisifes the conditions or not . This one thing has **certainity of 100%**.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Algorithm :-** \\n1. As i told you in **backtracking,** one thing is sure i.e a **helper method**. In our problem we will need a bool helper method which will check the palindrome conditions, let\\'s name it as `bool isPalindrome()` .\\n2. Now let\\'s **create some variables** : `result` vector for storing all the substring which satisfies the palindrome condition , `path` vector for storing the ongoing substr which has the potential of satisfying the conditions of palindrome , `start` variable for storing the start position of the current substr , `index i` for traversing inside the substring and `n` fro storing the size of given string `s`.\\n3. **Now we search** from `start` till the end of the string. Once we reach a position `i` such that the sub-string from `start to i (s.substr(start, i - start + 1)) is a palindrome`, we add it to our `path` variable. Then we recursively call the same method to execute the remaining substring . Once we reach the end of the string, we add palindromes `path` into the `result`  of all the *possible partitioning* . \\n4. Remember that at position `i` , we find `s.substr(start, i - start + 1)` to be a palindrome and we immediately add it to `path` . Now think that there may be a  position `j` such that `j > i` and `s.substr(start, j - start + 1)` is also a palindrome. Thus now we need to go back to our `start`  before adding `s.substr(start, i - start + 1)` to `path` and continue to find the next palindrome position after `i` . And after this evertime we simply need to remove or pop `s.substr(start, i - start + 1)` out of `path` to execute the backtracking algo . \\n5. The steps we executed in the above step is none other than the **famous dfs** . \\n\\n***\\n\\n**Code:-**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        vector<vector<string>> result;\\n        vector<string> path;\\n        partition(s, 0, path, result);//dfs calls\\n        return result;\\n    }\\nprivate: \\n    //DFS steps\\n    void partition(string& s, int start, vector<string>& path, vector<vector<string>>& result) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        if (start == n) {\\n            result.push_back(path);\\n        } else {\\n            for (int i = start; i < n; i++) {\\n                if (isPalindrome(s, start, i)) {\\n                    path.push_back(s.substr(start, i - start + 1));\\n                    partition(s, i + 1, path, result);\\n                    path.pop_back();\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    //helper function to safe check whether a substr is palindrome or not\\n    bool isPalindrome(string& s, int l, int r) {\\n        while (l < r) {\\n            if (s[l++] != s[r--]) {\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Time Complexity :-** *`O(n*(2^n)) [n=length of the string] `*\\n**Space Complexity :-** *`O(n) [beacause of recursion stack]`*\\n***\\n\\n***\\n\\n**[My Github Repo](https://github.com/Jatin-Shihora/LeetCode-Solutions) where I keep track of my solutions :)))**\\n\\n***\\n\\n***\\n**If you have some doubts feel free to bug me anytime or If you understood than don\\'t forget to upvote ;)**",

We look at every substring of `str` `(str[:1],...,str[:-1]` and check if it is a palindrome. The check is simply `if str[:i] == str[:i][::-1]:` .

Let us use function `find_all_palindromes`, where:\\n\\n1. `s` is input string, imagine `abacc`.\\n2. Output is lengths of biggest palindromes for each of the `2n-1` possible middles. Why there is `2n-1`? Because it can be either letter or in between letters.\\n3. Here I use very simple way to find all palindromes: just consider every possible substring, there will be `O(n^2)` of them and check in `O(n)` if it is palindrome. Total complexity of this step is `O(n^3)`, but we do not care here: complexity of the next step will be much bigger.\\n\\nNow, let us `dp[i+1]` be solution for `s[:i]`. How we can find `dp[i+1]`? We need to iterate over all `k in range (0, N)`: possible starts of last palindrome and check `if B[2*i-k+1] >= k`: this condition means that `s[i-k: i+1]` is palindrome: so now we just iterate over all solutions for `dp[i-k]` and add this string to the end of solutions. Why I prefer here `dp` solution, not backtracking, because it is more universal and you can solve **132. Palindrome Partitioning II** just changing code a bit.\\n\\n**Comlexity**: as we discussed, complexity of finding all palindromes is `O(n^3)`. Now, imagine we have string `aaa...aa` with length `n`. Then there will be exactly `2^(n-1)` ways to split this string in palindromes: we can cut it in any of `n-1` places. So, there will be `O(2^n* n)` time and space to keep solution for `s`. Also we keep solution for all prefixes of `s`, but we have `O(2^n * n + 2^(n-1)*(n-1) + ...)` which is still `O(2^n * n)`. Space complexity is the same: we need this amount of memory just to keep answer.\\n\\n**Remark** I ran this code 6 months ago and it was around 60-70ms, now it is 600-700ms, this means, that leetcode added new tests and histogram is not relevant at the moment. Do not be discouraged whey you see something like  faster than 10%, it is not true.\\n\\n**Remark2** Note again, that `find_all_palindromes(s)` has complexity `O(n^3)` here, and there is `O(n^2)` and even `O(n)` algorithms for this. But if you change this part, difference will be negligible: you can try and will see.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def partition(self, s):\\n        def find_all_palindromes(s):\\n            B = [0] * (2*n)\\n            for i, j in combinations_with_replacement(range(n), 2):\\n                if s[i:j+1] == s[i:j+1][::-1]:\\n                    B[i+j+1] = max(B[i+j+1], j-i+1)\\n            return B\\n        \\n        n = len(s)\\n        B = find_all_palindromes(s)\\n        \\n        dp = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\\n        dp[0] = [[]]\\n        for i in range(0, n):\\n            for k in range(0, i+1):\\n                if B[2*i-k+1] >= k:\\n                    for elem in dp[i-k]:\\n                        dp[i + 1].append(elem  + [s[i-k:i+1]])\\n\\n        return dp[-1]\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Where i can have the first partition.\\n\\nBut, if they don\\'t allow to partition over there, then our second partition will be xx|yy. Because this \"xx\" is a palindrome substring. Thus we still left out with yy, so if i do the partion over here xxy|y the answer will be no, because if i do the partition over here the substring \"xxy\" is not a palindrome.\\n\\nCan i do a partition over here xxyy|. No. Because xxyy is not a palindromic substring. So, we can see when we started we can do a partition over here x|xyy OR xx|yy so that is what we do. We try to do partition where ever it is possible\\n\\nSo, in the first case we did a partition over x|xyy where we left out with xyy. So, if i do a partiton like x|x|yy where x it\\'self a palindrome. And we left out with a substring yy\\nNow can you do a partition over here x|xy|y. No, because this substring xy is not a palindrome\\nAgain can we do a partition over here x|xyy|. No, because this substring xyy is not a palindrome\\n\\nSo, the only partition possible is x|x|yy. And after that we tend to call the recursion for remaining substring\\n\\nIf i try to do a partition over here x|x|y|y so, the substring y in itself is a palindromic substring. After that we left out with remaining y substring.\\nNow you ask can we do a partition over here x|x|yy|, Yes\\n\\nLike this way, we do the partition in complete STRING using recursion. And with the help of Backtracking we store our answer.\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/1b01b518-620e-4e35-b0a3-49f034611e67_1674347528.772972.png)\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/ba149c7d-b4d5-4c1d-abb8-8b76f8342241_1674347548.816257.png)\\n\\n\\nAll backtracking problems are composed by these three steps: choose, explore, unchoose.\\nSo for each problem, you need to know:\\n\\nchoose what? For this problem, we choose each substring.\\nhow to explore? For this problem, we do the same thing to the remained string. unchoose Do the opposite operation of choose.\\nLet\\'s take this problem as an example:\\n1. Define helper(): Usually we need a helper funcition in backtracking problem, to accept more parameters.\\n2. Parameters: Usually we need the following parameters\\n\\n    1. The object you are working on:  For this problem is String s.\\n    2. A start index or an end index which indicate which part you are working on: For this problem, we use substring to indicate the start index.\\n    3. A step result, to remember current choose and then do unchoose : For this problem, we use List<String> step.\\n    4. A final result, to remember the final result. Usually when we add, we use \\'result.add(new ArrayList<>(step))\\' instead of \\'result.add(step)\\', since step is reference passed. We will modify step later, so we need to copy it and add the copy to the result;\\n\\n3 .Base case: The base case defines when to add step into result, and when to return.\\n4 .Use for-loop : Usually we need a for loop to iterate though the input String s, so that we can choose all the options.\\n5 .Choose : In this problem, if the substring of s is palindrome, we add it into the step, which means we choose this substring.\\n6 .Explore : In this problem, we want to do the same thing to the remaining substring. So we recursively call our function.\\n7 .Un-Choose : We draw back, remove the chosen substring, in order to try other options.\\n\\n# Code\\n```python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:\\n        res = []\\n\\n        def extend(i, cur):\\n            if i >= len(s):\\n                res.append(cur[::])\\n            p = \\'\\'\\n            for j in range(i, len(s)):\\n                p += s[j]\\n                if p == p[::-1]:\\n                    extend(j + 1, cur + [p])\\n        \\n        extend(0, [])\\n        return res\\n```\\n```java []\\nclass Solution {\\n   public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {\\n        // Backtracking\\n        // Edge case\\n        if(s == null || s.length() == 0) return new ArrayList<>();\\n        \\n        List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();\\n        helper(s, new ArrayList<>(), result);\\n        return result;\\n    }\\n    public void helper(String s, List<String> step, List<List<String>> result) {\\n        // Base case\\n        if(s == null || s.length() == 0) {\\n            result.add(new ArrayList<>(step));\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        for(int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++) {\\n            String temp = s.substring(0, i);\\n            if(!isPalindrome(temp)) continue; // only do backtracking when current string is palindrome\\n            \\n            step.add(temp);  // choose\\n            helper(s.substring(i, s.length()), step, result); // explore\\n            step.remove(step.size() - 1); // unchoose\\n        }\\n        return;\\n    }\\n    public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {\\n        int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;\\n        while(left <= right) {\\n            if(s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right))\\n                return false;\\n            left ++;\\n            right --;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        vector<vector<string>> result;\\n        vector<string> path;\\n        partition(s, 0, path, result);//dfs calls\\n        return result;\\n    }\\nprivate: \\n    //DFS steps\\n    void partition(string& s, int start, vector<string>& path, vector<vector<string>>& result) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        if (start == n) {\\n            result.push_back(path);\\n        } else {\\n            for (int i = start; i < n; i++) {\\n                if (isPalindrome(s, start, i)) {\\n                    path.push_back(s.substr(start, i - start + 1));\\n                    partition(s, i + 1, path, result);\\n                    path.pop_back();\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    //helper function to safe check whether a substr is palindrome or not\\n    bool isPalindrome(string& s, int l, int r) {\\n        while (l < r) {\\n            if (s[l++] != s[r--]) {\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        vector<vector<string>> res;\\n        vector<string> path; // here we are generating list everythime, so at the end this will be our list\\n        helper(0, s, path, res); // calling to recursion function start from index 0 and string s\\n        return res; //returning\\n    }\\n    // Entire recursive function, that generates all the partition substring\\n    void helper(int index, string s, vector<string> &path, vector<vector<string>> &res){\\n        // Base Condition, which means when we have done partition at the end (n), then add it to our ultimate result\\n        if(index == s.size()){\\n            res.push_back(path);\\n            return;//returning\\n        }\\n        // then partition\\n        for(int i = index; i < s.size(); i++){\\n            if(isPalindrome(s, index, i)){ // what we are checking over here is, if we partition the string from index to i Example-(0, 0) is palindrome or not\\n                path.push_back(s.substr(index, i - index + 1)); // take the substring and store it in our list & call the next substring from index + 1\\n                helper(i + 1, s, path, res); // as we have done for (0, 0) then our next will be from (1)\\n                path.pop_back(); // please make sure you remove when you backtrack. \\n                // Why?

As i told you in backtracking, one thing is sure i.e a helper method. In our problem we will need a bool helper method which will check the palindrome conditions, let\\'s name it as bool isPalindrome().\\n2. Now let\\'s create some variables : result vector for storing all the substring which satisfies the palindrome condition , path vector for storing the ongoing substr which has the potential of satisfying the conditions of palindrome , start variable for storing the start position of the current substr , index i for traversing inside the substring and n fro storing the size of given string s.\\n3. Now we search from start till the end of the string. Once we reach a position i such that the sub-string from start to i (s.substr(start, i - start + 1)) is a palindrome, we add it to our path variable. Then we recursively call the same method to execute the remaining substring . Once we reach the end of the string, we add palindromes path into the result of all the possible partitioning .\\n4. Remember that at position i , we find s.substr(start, i - start + 1) to be a palindrome and we immediately add it to path . Now think that there may be a position j such that j > i and s.substr(start, j - start + 1) is also a palindrome. Thus now we need to go back to our start before adding s.substr(start, i - start + 1) to path and continue to find the next palindrome position after i . And after this evertime we simply need to remove or pop s.substr(start, i - start + 1) out of path to execute the backtracking algo .\\n5. The steps we executed in the above step is none other than the famous dfs .\\n\\n# Code\\n```python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:\\n        res = []\\n\\n        def extend(i, cur):\\n            if i >= len(s):\\n                res.append(cur[::])\\n            p = \\'\\'\\n            for j in range(i, len(s)):\\n                p += s[j]\\n                if p == p[::-1]:\\n                    extend(j + 1, cur + [p])\\n        \\n        extend(0, [])\\n        return res\\n```\\n```java []\\nclass Solution {\\n   public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {\\n        // Backtracking\\n        // Edge case\\n        if(s == null || s.length() == 0) return new ArrayList<>();\\n        \\n        List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();\\n        helper(s, new ArrayList<>(), result);\\n        return result;\\n    }\\n    public void helper(String s, List<String> step, List<List<String>> result) {\\n        // Base case\\n        if(s == null || s.length() == 0) {\\n            result.add(new ArrayList<>(step));\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        for(int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++) {\\n            String temp = s.substring(0, i);\\n            if(!isPalindrome(temp)) continue; // only do backtracking when current string is palindrome\\n            \\n            step.add(temp);  // choose\\n            helper(s.substring(i, s.length()), step, result); // explore\\n            step.remove(step.size() - 1); // unchoose\\n        }\\n        return;\\n    }\\n    public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {\\n        int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;\\n        while(left <= right) {\\n            if(s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right))\\n                return false;\\n            left ++;\\n            right --;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        vector<vector<string>> result;\\n        vector<string> path;\\n        partition(s, 0, path, result);//dfs calls\\n        return result;\\n    }\\nprivate: \\n    //DFS steps\\n    void partition(string& s, int start, vector<string>& path, vector<vector<string>>& result) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        if (start == n) {\\n            result.push_back(path);\\n        } else {\\n            for (int i = start; i < n; i++) {\\n                if (isPalindrome(s, start, i)) {\\n                    path.push_back(s.substr(start, i - start + 1));\\n                    partition(s, i + 1, path, result);\\n                    path.pop_back();\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    //helper function to safe check whether a substr is palindrome or not\\n    bool isPalindrome(string& s, int l, int r) {\\n        while (l < r) {\\n            if (s[l++] != s[r--]) {\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        vector<vector<string>> res;\\n        vector<string> path; // here we are generating list everythime, so at the end this will be our list\\n        helper(0, s, path, res); // calling to recursion function start from index 0 and string s\\n        return res; //returning\\n    }\\n    // Entire recursive function, that generates all the partition substring\\n    void helper(int index, string s, vector<string> &path, vector<vector<string>> &res){\\n        // Base Condition, which means when we have done partition at the end (n), then add it to our ultimate result\\n        if(index == s.size()){\\n            res.push_back(path);\\n            return;//returning\\n        }\\n        // then partition\\n        for(int i = index; i < s.size(); i++){\\n            if(isPalindrome(s, index, i)){ // what we are checking over here is, if we partition the string from index to i Example-(0, 0) is palindrome or not\\n                path.push_back(s.substr(index, i - index + 1)); // take the substring and store it in our list & call the next substring from index + 1\\n                helper(i + 1, s, path, res); // as we have done for (0, 0) then our next will be from (1)\\n                path.pop_back(); // please make sure you remove when you backtrack. \\n                // Why?

It does this by creating a copy of the string s, reversing it and comparing it with the original string. If they are the same, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.\\n\\n***Helper function call(int ind,vector<vector<string>>& ans,vector<string>& vec,string s)*** :\\nrecursive function to find all possible partitions of the string s into palindromes.\\n\\nThis function takes four parameters:\\n\\n1. **Integer ind** representing the current index in the string s being processed.\\n2. A reference to a **vector of vectors of strings ans** to store all the partitions.\\n3. A reference to a **vector of strings vec** to store the current partition being processed.\\n4. A **string s** representing the original string to be partitioned.\\n\\n**BASE CASE:**\\n1. The function checks current index ind is equal to the size of the string s. If it is, it pushes the current partition stored in the vec to the ans and return.\\n\\nIt starts a for loop from the current index ind to the end of the string s, and for each substring from ind to i, it checks if the substring is a palindrome using the helper function palind(string s).\\n\\nIf the substring is a palindrome, it pushes the substring to the vec and calls the helper function recursively with updated index i+1 and vec. After the recursive call, it pops the last element from the vec to restore the vec to its previous state and try next substring.\\n\\nIt continues this process until all possible partitions have been found and stored in the ans vector. Finally, it returns the ans vector.\\n\\n\\n# C++ Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    bool palind(string s)\\n    {\\n        string a=s;\\n        reverse(a.begin(),a.end());\\n        if (a==s) return true;\\n        else return false;\\n    }\\n    \\n    void call(int ind,vector<vector<string>>& ans,vector<string>& vec,string s)\\n    {\\n        if (ind==s.size())\\n        {\\n            ans.push_back(vec);\\n        }\\n        \\n        for (int i=ind;i<s.size();i++)\\n        {\\n            if (palind(s.substr(ind,i-ind+1)))\\n            {\\n                vec.push_back(s.substr(ind,i-ind+1));\\n                call(i+1,ans,vec,s);\\n                vec.pop_back();\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\npublic:\\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        vector<vector<string>> ans;\\n        vector<string> vec;\\n        call(0,ans,vec,s);\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n# JAVA Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    boolean palind(String s) {\\n        String a = new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString();\\n        if (a.equals(s)) {\\n            return true;\\n        } else {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    void call(int ind, List<List<String>> ans, List<String> vec, String s) {\\n        if (ind == s.length()) {\\n            ans.add(new ArrayList<String>(vec));\\n        }\\n        \\n        for (int i = ind; i < s.length(); i++) {\\n            if (palind(s.substring(ind, i + 1))) {\\n                vec.add(s.substring(ind, i + 1));\\n                call(i + 1, ans, vec, s);\\n                vec.remove(vec.size() - 1);\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {\\n        List<List<String>> ans = new ArrayList<List<String>>();\\n        List<String> vec = new ArrayList<String>();\\n        call(0, ans, vec, s);\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO((2^n*n) : The reason for this is that the function \\'call\\' is called recursively for each possible substring of \\'s\\' and the function \\'palind\\' is called for each substring to check if it is a palindrome. \\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(n^2) : the function \\'call\\' is using a recursive call stack and the function \\'palind\\' is creating a copy of the input string for each call.

                "content": "This solution relies on two parts:\\n- creating a dynamic programming table to cache whether given substrings are palindromic\\n- recursively going through all possible substring partitions if they are palindromic\\n\\nFor the first part of this solution, observe that we are building a dynamic programming table based on a recursive palindromic definition\\n- if a string is of length 1, then it is a palindrome\\n- if a string is of length 2, then it is a palindrome only if the first and last characters are equal\\n- otherwise, a string is a palindrome if its first and last characters are equal, and the remaining string when you remove the first and last characters is also a palindrome\\n\\nTo generate all palindromes and take advantage of this recursive definition, observe that we are looping by length and starting position, instead of starting and ending position. This allows us to use previously computed results in building our final answer, since any string of length `n` will use a string of length `n - 2` to determine whether or not it is a palindrome, provided we are above the base case.\\n\\nFrom here, we recursively iterate through the string, starting at the beginning position. Since we need the *entire* string to be split into valid palindromes, we go through all palindromes encountered at each position and then add that to our final result, recursively applying the same process on the remaining string. If we encounter the end of the string, that means we have partitioned the whole string into palindromes, so we add this to our final answer; otherwise, we omit that \"partititioning\" from our final answer.\\n\\nNote that we do not have to perform the traverse method in the main function call (`partition()`), but we can rather do it within the `if` statement in the `build()` `for` loop (instead of doing `if (dp[pos][curr])` we can change it to `if(traverse(s, pos, curr)`). This will save us a quadratic number of operations at the beginning, and will have faster net time complexity; however, for the purposes of clarity in the explanation, I chose to do it the displayed way.\\n\\nThe time complexity of this solution is exponential `(O(n * 2 ^ n)`, where `n` is the size of the string, and the space complexity is `O(n^2)` for our dynamic programming table. The  time complexity stems from the recursive operation that we have to perform when generating all possible answers, since the only way to do this is to backtrack and break up the string, which in the worst case goes through `n` choices at each level, creating an exponential complexity.\\n\\n```\\nvector<vector<int>> dp;\\nvector<vector<string>> result;\\nvector<string> storage;\\nbool traverse(string& s, int left, int right) {\\n\\tif (dp[left][right] >= 0) {\\n\\t\\treturn dp[left][right];\\n\\t}\\n\\tif (left == right) {\\n\\t\\treturn dp[left][right] = 1;\\n\\t}\\n\\tif (right - left == 1) {\\n\\t   return dp[left][right] = s[left] == s[right];\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn dp[left][right] = s[left] == s[right] && traverse(s, left + 1, right - 1);\\n}\\nvoid build(string& s, int pos) {\\n\\tif (pos == s.size()) {\\n\\t\\tresult.push_back(storage);\\n\\t\\treturn;\\n\\t}\\n\\tfor (int curr = pos; curr < s.size(); curr++) {\\n\\t\\tif (dp[pos][curr]) {\\n\\t\\t\\tstorage.push_back(s.substr(pos, curr - pos + 1));\\n\\t\\t\\tbuild(s, curr + 1);\\n\\t\\t\\tstorage.pop_back();\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\nvector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n\\tdp.resize(s.size(), vector<int>(s.size(), -1));\\n\\tfor (int len = 1; len <= s.size(); len++) {\\n\\t\\tfor (int i = 0; i <= s.size() - len; i++) {\\n\\t\\t\\ttraverse(s, i, i + len - 1);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\tbuild(s, 0);\\n\\treturn result;\\n}\\n```",

For outer for loop (i) and inner for loop (j) is O(n^2), but there is another inner most for loop (List<String> list: lists) with iterate over all partitioning combinations of a substring. So what is the number of partitioning combinations in worst case? Think about a string like 'aaaaa' in worsk case, you can break up between  any two 'a's, so the number of possible partitions is O(2^n). In this case, the time complexity of the solution would be O(n^2 * 2^n). Am I wrong?",

Create a list to store the final result.\\n2. Create an empty list to store the current partition.\\n3.  Write a recursive function to generate all the possible partitions.\\n4. In the function, check if the current partition is a valid palindrome partition or not. If it\\'s valid, add the current partition to the final result.\\n5. For each character of the string, consider all possible substrings starting at the current character and check if it\\'s a palindrome. If it\\'s a palindrome, add it to the current partition and recursively find all partitions that can be formed from the rest of the string.\\n6. When we have traversed the whole string, add the current partition to the final result.\\n7. Return the final result.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(n*(2^n)) where n is the length of the string s. In the worst case, we have 2^n possible partitions, and for each partition, we need to check if it\\'s a valid palindrome partition or not, which takes O(n) time.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(n) where n is the length of the string s. The maximum depth of the recursion tree is n. At each level of the recursion tree, we create a new partition of length n.

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe aim is to partition the string into all possible palindrome combinations. To achieve this, we must generate all possible substrings of a string by partitioning at every index until we reach the end of the string. Example, abba can be partitioned as [\"a\",\"ab\",\"abb\",\"abba\"]. Each generated substring is considered as a potential candidate if it a palindrome.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe idea is to generate all possible substrings of a given string and expand each possibility if it is a potential candidate. The first thing that comes to mind is Depth First Search. In Depth First Search, we recursively expand potential candidates until the defined goal is achieved. After that, we backtrack to explore the next potential candidate.\\n\\nBacktracking incrementally build the candidates for the solution and discards the candidates (backtrack) if they doesn\\'t satisfy the condition.\\n\\nThe backtracking algorithms consists of the following steps:\\n\\n- Choose: Choose the potential candidate. Here, our potential candidates are all substrings that could be generated from the given string.\\n\\n- Constraint: Define a constraint that must be satisfied by the chosen candidate. In this case, the constraint is that the string must be a palindrome.\\n\\n- Goal: We must define the goal that determines if have found the required solution and we must backtrack. Here, our goal is achieved if we have reached the end of the string.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n*2^n)$$ where $$n$$ is the length of string s. This is the worst-case time complexity when all the possible substrings are palindrome.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the string s. This space will be used to store the recursion stack.\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    List<List<String>> ans = new ArrayList<>();\\n    List<String> curr = new ArrayList<>();\\n    boolean isPalindrome(String s, int low, int high) {\\n        while (low < high)\\n            if (s.charAt(low++) != s.charAt(high--)) return false;\\n\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    void genrate(String s,int start)\\n    {\\n        if(start >=s.length())\\n            ans.add(new ArrayList<>(curr));\\n        for(int i=start;i<s.length();i++)\\n        {\\n            if(isPalindrome(s,start,i))\\n            {\\n                curr.add(s.substring(start,i+1));\\n                genrate(s,i+1);\\n                curr.remove(curr.size()-1);\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {\\n        genrate(s,0);\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\nvector<vector<string>> ans;\\nvector<string> curr;\\n    bool isPalindrome(string &s, int low, int high) {\\n        while (low < high) {\\n            if (s[low++] != s[high--]) return false;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    void genrate(string &s,int start)\\n    {\\n        if(start >=s.length())\\n            ans.push_back(curr);\\n        for(int i=start;i<s.length();i++)\\n        {\\n            if(isPalindrome(s,start,i))\\n            {\\n                curr.push_back(s.substr(start,i-start+1));\\n                genrate(s,i+1);\\n                curr.pop_back();\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        genrate(s,0);\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

The goal is to return all possible partitions of the string s.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nOne approach to solving this problem is to use backtracking. The idea is to iterate through the characters of the string and for each character, check if the substring from that character to the end of the string is a palindrome. If it is, we add that substring to the current partition and recursively call the function for the remaining substring. Once we reach the end of the string, we add the current partition to the final list of partitions.\\n\\n# Algorithm\\n1. Create an empty list `partitions` to store the final partitions\\n2. Create a helper function `backtrack(start, partition)` that takes the current starting index and the current partition as input\\n3. Within the helper function, check if the current starting index is equal to the length of the string. If it is, add the current partition to the `partitions` list and return\\n4. Iterate through the characters from the current starting index to the end of the string\\n5. For each character, check if the substring from that character to the end of the string is a palindrome. If it is, add that substring to the current partition and recursively call the `backtrack()` function for the remaining substring\\n6. Return the `partitions` list\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n$$O(2^n)$$ where n is the length of the input string. This is because for each character, we are calling the function recursively and at each level, we are iterating through all the characters from the current starting index to the end of the string. This results in a worst-case time complexity of $$O(2^n)$$.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n$$O(n)$$ because we are storing the partitions in a list and the maximum number of partitions can be n.\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:\\n        partitions = []  # create an empty list to store the final partitions\\n        \\n        def backtrack(start, partition):\\n            if start == len(s):  # check if the current starting index is equal to the length of the string\\n                partitions.append(partition)  # if it is, add the current partition to the final list\\n                return\\n            \\n            for i in range(start, len(s)):  # iterate through the characters from the current starting index to the end of the string\\n                if s[start:i+1] == s[start:i+1][::-1]:  # check if the substring is a palindrome\\n                    backtrack(i+1, partition + [s[start:i+1]])  # if it is, add that substring to the current partition and recursively call the function for the remaining substring\\n        \\n        backtrack(0, [])  # call the helper function with starting index 0 and an empty partition\\n        return partitions  # return the final list of partitions\\n\\n```",

The inner loop iterates over all possible starting positions for the substring.\\n\\nIt then uses a recursive helper function helper to explore all possible partitions of the input string s. The function takes the current index of the string, the current partition path, and the overall results as input.\\nIt then loops over all possible end positions of the current partition, checking if the substring from the current index to the end position is a palindrome. If it is, it adds the substring to the current partition path and recursively calls the helper function with the updated index and partition path.\\nOnce the index reaches the end of the input string, it adds the current partition path to the overall results.\\n\\nFinally, the partition method initializes an empty list results and calls the helper function with the initial index of 0 and an empty partition path, returning the results list containing all possible partitions of the input string s into palindromes.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe approach used in the partition method of the Solution class is a backtracking approach. It uses a recursive helper function to explore all possible partitions of the input string s into palindromes.\\n\\nThe method starts by creating a 2D boolean array isPalindrome of the same length as the input string s, to keep track of whether a substring of s is a palindrome or not.\\nIt then uses a nested loop to fill in the isPalindrome array by checking if a substring from start to end is a palindrome or not.\\nThe outer loop iterates over all possible substring lengths, starting from 2 and ending at the length of the input string. The inner loop iterates over all possible starting positions for the substring.\\n\\nNext, it uses a recursive helper function helper to explore all possible partitions of the input string s.\\nThe function takes the current index of the string, the current partition path, and the overall results as input.\\nIt then loops over all possible end positions of the current partition, checking if the substring from the current index to the end position is a palindrome (by checking the isPalindrome array).\\nIf it is, it adds the substring to the current partition path and recursively calls the helper function with the updated index and partition path.\\nOnce the index reaches the end of the input string, it adds the current partition path to the overall results.\\n\\nFinally, the partition method initializes an empty list results and calls the helper function with the initial index of 0 and an empty partition path, returning the results list containing all possible partitions of the input string s into palindromes.\\n\\nThe backtracking approach allows us to explore all possible partitions of the input string s into palindromes by generating all possible partitions recursively, and then backtracking when a partition doesn\\'t meet the requirements (i.e. a substring is not a palindrome). This allows us to generate all possible partitions without having to check all possible partitions in advance which would be an exponential time complexity.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe time complexity of the partition method of the Solution class is O(n^2) where n is the length of the input string s.\\n\\nThe first step of the method is to fill the isPalindrome array, which takes O(n^2) time.\\nThe nested loop iterates over all possible substrings of s and checks if they are palindromes, which takes O(n^2) time in total.\\n\\nThe next step is to use the recursive helper function helper to explore all possible partitions of the input string s.\\nIn the worst case, the function is called for all possible partitions of the input string, which would take O(n^2) time.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe space complexity of the partition method is O(n^2) as well.\\nThe isPalindrome array takes O(n^2) space to store the information about all possible substrings of s being palindrome or not.\\nThe recursive calls in the helper function also takes O(n^2) space in the worst case, where all possible partitions are stored in the results list.\\n\\nTherefore, the time complexity of the partition method is O(n^2) and the space complexity is also O(n^2) where n is the length of the input string s.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.isPalindrome = None\\n    \\n    def helper(self, s: str, index: int, path: List[str], results: List[List[str]]):\\n        if index == len(s):\\n            results.append(path)\\n            return\\n        \\n        for end in range(index, len(s)):\\n            if self.isPalindrome[index][end]:\\n                newPath = path[:]\\n                newPath.append(s[index:end+1])\\n                self.helper(s, end + 1, newPath, results)\\n    \\n    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:\\n        self.isPalindrome = [[False for i in range(len(s))] for j in range(len(s))]\\n        \\n        for i in range(len(s)):\\n            self.isPalindrome[i][i] = True\\n        \\n        for length in range(2, len(s) + 1):\\n            for start in range(len(s) - length + 1):\\n                end = start + length - 1\\n                if s[start] == s[end]:\\n                    if length == 2:\\n                        self.isPalindrome[start][end] = True\\n                    else:\\n                        self.isPalindrome[start][end] |= self.isPalindrome[start + 1][end - 1]\\n        \\n        results = []\\n        self.helper(s, 0, [], results)\\n        return results\\n\\n```",

Try partioning a substring from `start` till  `end`.\\n2. Check if the partioned substring `( s.substr(start, end -start + 1) )` is a `palindrome or not`.\\n\\n\\t2.1) If **yes**, include into the answer, try searching for next string where the **new start =  end + 1** (repeat step 1: Recursion called).\\n\\t\\n\\t2.2) Also try to backtrack as from one index(`ie: start`) there can be multiple indexes `ie(end)`, which can generate a palindrome substring. So its important to backtrack and check for other string too.\\n\\n**Example Explaining Point 2.2:**\\n\\nstring = `aaa`. lets say `start = 0, end = 1`. ie(substring = `aa`) makes a palindrome.\\n**BUT**\\n`start = 0, end = 3` ie(substring `aaa`) **ALSO MAKES** a new palindrome. Thus, its important to backtrack the last inserted substring into the answer so in order to try new combinations.\\n\\n**Algo/Idea:**\\n1. Start trying to check every substring from  `[start- end] till end == s.size() (ie. The end of string)`.\\n2. Loop from `start` to `s.size()` and check which substring is a `paindrome` partition.\\n3. If the substring is a palindrome, insert it into the `ds` and call the next recrusive function with now **`(start = end + 1)`, so that it can start partioning again with the next index with the help of recursive function.**.\\n4. Remove the last inserted string in order to try other partitions too.\\n\\n**Code:**\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    \\n    bool isPalindrome(string s, int low , int high){\\n        while(low < high){\\n            if(s[low] != s[high])\\n                return false;\\n            low++;\\n            high--;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    \\n    void solve(int start, string s, vector<vector<string>> &ans, vector<string> &ds){\\n        \\n        if(start == s.size()){\\n            ans.push_back(ds);\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        \\n        for(int end = start; end < s.size(); end++){\\n            \\n            if(isPalindrome(s,start,end)){\\n                string str = s.substr(start, end - start + 1);\\n                ds.push_back(str);\\n                solve(end + 1, s, ans, ds); // Note: Here solve(end+1) and not \"start + 1\" as \"end\" will be the latest index where the new palindome string is found and inserted.\\n                ds.pop_back(); // Backtracking it, so that we can try the last palindrome inserted with other next indexes too.\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        vector<vector<string>> ans;\\n        vector<string> ds;\\n        int start = 0;\\n        solve(start,s,ans,ds);\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Partitioning means we would end up generating every substring and checking for palindrome at every step. Since this is a repetitive task being done again and again, at this point we should think of recursion. The recursion continues until the entire string is exhausted. After partitioning, every palindromic substring is inserted in a data structure When the base case has reached the list of palindromes generated during that recursion call is inserted in a vector of vectors/list of list.\\n\\n**Dry Run:-**\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/dbedad9b-a814-417f-b23a-ba9cdf252259_1661613943.4511516.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n**Code**\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    //fuction to check given range is palindrome or not?\\n    bool isPalindrome(string s,int st,int ed){\\n        while(st<ed){\\n            if(s[st++]!=s[ed--]) return false;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    //Recursive fuction \\n    void solve(int ind,int n,string s,vector<vector<string>>& ans,vector<string>& temp){\\n        // if ind is equal to n it means string exhausted then push temp string inside ans vector\\n        if(ind==n){\\n            ans.push_back(temp);\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        //looping for all char in string which make palindrome sub string\\n        for(int i=ind;i<n;i++){\\n            //check if substring will make palindrome, then push that stirng inside the temp and call recursive for further check\\n            if(isPalindrome(s,ind,i)){\\n                temp.push_back(s.substr(ind,i-ind+1));\\n                solve(i+1,n,s,ans,temp);\\n                // when you back from current call, then pop last inseted string\\n                temp.pop_back();\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        //For storing ans substring\\n        vector<vector<string>> ans;\\n        //For temperary inserting and poping substring\\n        vector<string> temp;\\n        // Call solve fucntion\\n        solve(0,s.length(),s,ans,temp);\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "Hi,\\nAs we need all palindromes so we need to first keep track of indexes that will tell us if substring ```l to r``` is palindrome or not.\\nSo for this we will create matrix say ```dp``` of ``` n*n``` where ``` n = s.size() ```. And in this matrix each entry ```dp[i][j]``` will tell us is ```substring( i to j )``` palindrome or not. \\n\\nNote : Matrix is not necessarily needed its here for easy understanding. You can remove matrix and can put palindrome check function ```ispalin(i,j-i+1)``` in place of ```dp[i][j]``` in solve function.\\n\\nLets see an example \\n- We have ```s = \"aab\"```.\\n- Matrix for this will be (here string is not stored in matrix its illustration to understand)\\n\\t![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/47bffff1-71b0-4800-9e0e-719316ccda1c_1625195409.9045327.png)\\n\\n- here 1 denotes that ```substr(i,j)``` is palindrome and 0 denotes not a palindrome.\\n- now we need to go from ```i=0``` to ```i=n-1``` and push substrings if corresponding entry is 1 else break.\\n- We will traverse in the following way\\n- 1. i=0 , j=0\\n- 2. at this point we have 3 choices either we can take ```substr(0 to 0) ```or ```substr (0 to 1)``` or ```substr (0 to 2)```\\n\\t-  1.  we can take  ```substr( 0 to 0)``` because ```dp[0][0] =1```. so if we take it then ```i = 1``` and ```j = 1```\\n\\t- 2. now again we have two choices either we take ```substr( 1 to 1)``` or ```substr(1 to 2)```.\\n\\t\\t- 1. Lets take ```substr(1 to 1)```.Since ```dp[1][1] =1``` so we can take it and ```i=2``` and ```j=2```.\\n\\t\\t- 2. Now we have only one choice ```substr(2 to 2)``` and ```dp[2][2]=1``` so we will take it too. Now ```i and j``` reaches to maximum length so our one answer would be ``` [ \"a\", \"a\" , \"b\" ]```.\\n\\t\\t- 1. Now lets choose ```substr(1 to 2)``` after 2nd step instead of ```substr(1 to 1)``` then we can see that ```dp[1][2]=0``` its not 1 that means this is not a palindrome so we cant consider it.\\n\\t- 1. Choose ```substr(0 to 1)``` instead of ```substr(0 to 0)``` in 2nd step. Since ```dp[0][1]=1``` we can take it and ```i=2 and j=2```.\\n\\t\\t- 1. for ```i=2 and j=2``` we have only one choice ```substr(2 to 2)``` and ```dp[2][2]=1``` so we can take it too. Now ```i and j``` reaches to maximum length again so our another answer would be ``` [ \"aa\" , \"b\" ]```.\\n\\t- 1. now we are left with one more choice in step 2 that is ```substr(0 to 2)``` but again ```dp[0][2]=0``` that means its not a palindrome ans we cant consider it.\\n- So we covered all choices and we have answer as ``` [ \"a\", \"a\" , \"b\" ] , [ \"aa\" , \"b\" ]```.\\n### Code with Matrix\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n// define matrix to check palindrome from i to j\\n    vector<vector<bool>> dp;\\n\\t\\n\\t// answer vector\\n    vector<vector<string>> ans;\\n\\t\\n\\t//palindrome function return true if s is palindrome else returns false\\n    bool ispalin(string s){\\n        int n=s.size();\\n        for(int i=0;i<=n/2;i++){\\n            if(s[i]!=s[n-1-i]) return false;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\t// temporary answer for each choice\\n    vector<string> v;\\n\\t\\n\\t//recursive function to implement backtracking\\n    void solve(string s,int i,int j,int n){\\n\\t\\n\\t// if i reaches to maximum length that is n then push temporary answer to final answer\\n        if(i==n){\\n            ans.push_back(v);\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        for(;j<n;j++){\\n            if(dp[i][j]){\\n                v.push_back(s.substr(i,j-i+1));\\n                solve(s,j+1,j+1,n);\\n                v.pop_back();\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return;\\n        \\n    }\\n    \\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        int n=s.size();\\n        dp.resize(n+1,vector<bool>(n+1,0));\\n        \\n        // initializing and filling all entries of matrix\\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\\n            for(int j=i;j<n;j++){\\n                if(i==j) dp[i][j]=1;\\n                else if(ispalin(s.substr(i,j-i+1))){\\n                    dp[i][j]=1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        solve(s,0,0,n);\\n        return ans;\\n        \\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n### Code without Matrix\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n\\t// answer vector\\n    vector<vector<string>> ans;\\n\\t\\n\\t//palindrome function return true if s is palindrome else returns false\\n    bool ispalin(string s){\\n        int n=s.size();\\n        for(int i=0;i<=n/2;i++){\\n            if(s[i]!=s[n-1-i]) return false;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\t// temporary answer for each choice\\n    vector<string> v;\\n\\t\\n\\t//recursive function to implement backtracking\\n    void solve(string s,int i,int j,int n){\\n\\t\\n\\t// if i reaches to maximum length that is n then push temporary answer to final answer\\n        if(i==n){\\n            ans.push_back(v);\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        for(;j<n;j++){\\n            if(ispalin(i,j-i+1){\\n                v.push_back(s.substr(i,j-i+1));\\n                solve(s,j+1,j+1,n);\\n                v.pop_back();\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return;\\n        \\n    }\\n    \\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {\\n        int n=s.size();\\n        solve(s,0,0,n);\\n        return ans;\\n        \\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n",

                "content": "* **Pattern**: Loop + Recursion (backtrack to be precise) combo\\nThis is a **classic problem from Elements of Programming** under Recursion chapter. The problems under this pattern are solved in **O(2^n) time** without DP (where the paths are required). In some problems where DP could be applied (where paths are not required, like just check if an answer/path is possible), can be solved in O(n^2) (or O(n^3), depends on funtions like .substring() etc)\\n\\t\\n* **Time complexity analysis** of this pattern problems - O(2^n): https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/discuss/889885/Lessons-learned\\n\\n* **DP or not**:\\nThough this can be solved by DP (the real DP), you could first confirm with interviewer about poterntial effect in time complexity.\\n\\t* LC DP: The **DP approach mentioned in LC is actually not DP** (my opinion). What it does is it **chaches the palindromic computation** of subproblems (which is good from interview perspective, and I would prefer implementing this as an optimization after implementing the recursive approach) and reuses it. But the original problem\\'s result (here path) is not obtained from its subproblems. instead is **re-computed** (same as the simple bactrack one). \\n\\t* Why the **real DP approach of O(n^2)** is **not beneficial** here is because here its actually not O(n^2), instead is **O(n^2 + 2^n)**. \\n**Reason**: \\nThere are **O(n(n+1)/2) prefixSubstrings** for a string s, which equates to the time complezity of total recursions. \\nEach prefixSubstring has to add itself with the partitioning combinations (the cache items) of its suffixSubstring. And there are **O(2^n) partitioning combinations for all the suffixStrings in total** in worst case (eg: suffixSubstring = \"aaaa..\") (Refer image at bottom)\\n**Links**: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/discuss/42095/Time-complexity:-why-O(n2) and https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/discuss/42095/Time-complexity:-why-O(n2)/945251\\n\\n* **Variations** of problem in this pattern: \\n\\t* is a path possible: dfs + dp OR bfs (word break, concatenated words, partition 2 equal sum subsets, partition k equal sum subsets). Bfs for Partition 2 equal is not yet discovered. Also, right now Partition k equal is oy solvable via backtracking.\\n\\t* shortest path length: dfs + dp OR bfs (palindrome partion 2)\\n\\t* return valid paths: backtrack (ie dfs) (palindrome partition, word break 2). Applying dp is not beneficial in time and space.\\n\\n**Code**:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {\\n        List<List<String>> ans = new ArrayList<>();\\n        recurse(0, s, ans, new ArrayList<>());\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n    \\n    private void recurse(int start, String s, List<List<String>> ans, List<String> list) {\\n        if (start >= s.length()) {\\n            ans.add(new ArrayList<>(list));\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        \\n        for (int end = start; end < s.length(); ++end) {\\n            if (isPalindrome(s, start, end)) {\\n                list.add(s.substring(start, end + 1));\\n                recurse(end + 1, s, ans, list);\\n                list.remove(list.size() - 1);\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    private boolean isPalindrome(String s, int left, int right) {\\n        while (left < right) {\\n            if (s.charAt(left++) != s.charAt(right--)) {\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    \\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe string input \\'abcde\\' in image can be considered as \\'aaaaa\\'.\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/021cf80f-cfab-4484-b4e2-4c2597705251_1621706267.8458343.jpeg)\\n\\n",

What I ended up doing is generating an array of palindrome combinations per index. The inspiration for this solution came from [Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/). We can iterate through the string and for each *S[i]* use 2 pointers (namely left and right) and keep expanding them for as long as they form a palindrome. The left pointer will eventual point to the beginning index (the palindrome\\'s starting point).\\n\\nFor example, for the string `aab`, the combinations array looks like this:\\n```\\npalindromes[0] => \"a\", \"aa\"\\npalindromes[1] => \"a\"\\npalindromes[2] => \"b\"\\n```\\n\\nOnce the array was generated, I used backtracing by advancing the index based on the size of the current palindrome combination.\\n\\nThis is my last run:\\n\\n**Runtime:** 4 ms, faster than 100.00% of C++ online submissions for Palindrome Partitioning.\\n**Memory Usage:** 9 MB, less than 92.26% of C++ online submissions for Palindrome Partitioning.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<vector<string>> partition(string str) {\\n        vector<vector<string>> palindromes(size(str));\\n        for (int i = 0; i < size(str); ++i) {\\n            int left = i, right = i;\\n            \\n            // single char palindrome\\n            palindromes[left].emplace_back(str.substr(i, 1));\\n            \\n            // expand to the right if possible (each expansion is a new palindrome)\\n            while (i < size(str) - 1 && str[right + 1] == str[right]) {\\n                ++right;\\n                palindromes[left].emplace_back(str.substr(i, right - left + 1));\\n            }\\n            \\n            // expand from the center if possible (each expansion is a new palindrome)\\n            while (left > 0 && right < size(str) - 1 && str[left - 1] == str[right + 1]) {\\n                ++right, --left;\\n                palindromes[left].emplace_back(str.substr(left, right - left + 1));\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        vector<vector<string>> output;\\n        vector<string> curr;\\n        generatePalindromePermutations(output, palindromes, curr, 0);\\n        return output;\\n    }\\nprivate:\\n    void generatePalindromePermutations(vector<vector<string>>& output, const vector<vector<string>>& palindromes, vector<string>& curr, int idx) {\\n        if (idx >= size(palindromes)) {\\n            output.emplace_back(curr);\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        for (int i = 0; i < size(palindromes[idx]); ++i) {\\n            curr.emplace_back(palindromes[idx][i]);\\n            generatePalindromePermutations(output, palindromes, curr, idx + size(palindromes[idx][i]));\\n            curr.pop_back();\\n        }\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "\\nBy observing, we can use DFS to solve the problem. DFS is extremely useful on problems like permutation combination etc..\\n\\nWhen we trying to solve a problem with Depth First Search (backtracking), it is useful for us to generate a recursion tree and speaks out the meaning of each level and each branches.\\n\\nIn this particular problem, each level representing a particular subproblems where s[0...level - 1] has already formed valid palindrome partition. The subproblem becomes solving the following s[level...end] subproblems. In the subproblems, we iterate index i from the current level index to the end of the string, if we see s[level...i] is a palindrome, then we can add the current substring s[level...i] to the list and going to the next subproblems s[i+1...end] by recursive call with updated parameter. \\n\\nFollowing the analysis, we can see that there are O(n!) levels of node in the recursive tree, and there are at most n level of recursion on the call stack. \\n\\nThen, the problem becomes how to check a string is palindrome. A Naive but working solution is to iterate the string with two pointers walking in the opposite direction:\\n\\n```\\nboolean isPalindrome(String s, int start, int end) {\\n\\twhile (start < end) {\\n\\t\\tif (s.charAt(start++) != s.charAt(end--)) {\\n\\t\\t\\treturn false;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBy taking this method we need O(n) time to check whether a substring s[i...j] is palindrome by calling isPalindrome(s, i, j).\\nThe total time complexity is O(n!*n).\\nSince there are at most O(n) recursive calls on the call stack and no extra data structure is allocated, space complexity O(n).\\n\\nHowever, I noticed that the palindrome problem can be solved by dynamic programming by the following observation:\\n1. The big problem (string) can be divided into smaller problem (substring or even characters)\\n2. The minimum sized problems (a single character) have identical or similar properties. \\n\\nAbove observation implies that using dynamic programming would be a choice. All we need to do is to figure out the base case and induction rules of the problem.\\n\\nbase case: dp[i][i] -> true (a single character is palindrome)\\ninduction rule: \\n\\t\\tdp[i][j] representing whether s[i...j] is a palindrome\\n\\t\\tdp[i][j] = true if s[i] == s[j] and s[i], s[j] is next to each other (i - j < 2), \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tor s[i] == s[j] and the subproblem s[i+1...j-1] is a valid palindrome (dp[i+1][j-1])\\n\\nwith the following dp relation we can take O(n^2) time and O(n^2) space to build up the memory:\\n\\n```\\nprivate boolean[][] generateMap(String s) {\\n\\tboolean[][] map = new boolean[s.length()][s.length()];\\n\\tfor (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\\n\\t\\tfor (int j = i; j < s.length(); j++) {\\n\\t\\t\\tmap[i][j] = (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) && (j - i <= 2 || map[i + 1][j - 1]));\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn map;\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nWith the memory we can know isPalindrome(s, i, j) in O(1) time by looking at the memory.\\nTotal time complexity is O(n!). If we count for the substring API of java, it would take O(n) time worse cases. A better approach might be using char[] array as input and use the String(char[] array, int offset, int length) constructor.\\nTotal space complexity is O(n^2)\\n               \\nAttached is the full code.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {\\n        List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();\\n        if (s == null || s.isEmpty()) {\\n            return result;\\n        }\\n        boolean[][] isPalindrome = generateMap(s);\\n        DFS(0, s, new ArrayList<>(), result, isPalindrome);\\n        return result;\\n    }\\n    \\n    private void DFS(int index, String input, List<String> curr, List<List<String>> result, boolean[][] isPalindrome) {\\n        if (index == input.length()) {\\n            result.add(new ArrayList<>(curr));\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        for (int i = index; i < input.length(); i++) {\\n            if (isPalindrome[index][i]) {\\n                curr.add(input.substring(index, i + 1));\\n                DFS(i + 1, input, curr, result, isPalindrome);\\n                curr.remove(curr.size() - 1);\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    private boolean[][] generateMap(String s) {\\n        boolean[][] map = new boolean[s.length()][s.length()];\\n        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\\n            for (int j = i; j < s.length(); j++) {\\n                map[i][j] = (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) && (j - i <= 2 || map[i + 1][j - 1]));\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return map;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI wrote down these words to help myself better understand the problem, and hopefully it would helps other.\\nAnd please tell me if any mistake is made!

The question is return true or false if the given `n` is power of two or not.

As already seen above, `n` will only have 1 set bit if it is power of 2. Then, we can AND (&) `n` and `n-1` and if the result is 0, it is power of 2. This works because if `n` is power of 2 with `i`th bit set, then in `n-1`, `i` will become unset and all bits to right of `i` will become set. Thus the result of AND will be 0.\\n\\n```python\\nIf n is a power of 2:\\nn    = 8 (1000)\\nn-1  = 7 (0111)\\n----------------\\n&    = 0 (0000)         (no set bit will be common between n and n-1)\\n\\nIf n is not a power of 2:\\nn    = 10 (1010)\\nn-1  =  9 (1001)\\n-----------------\\n&    =  8 (1000)         (atleast 1 set bit will be common between n and n-1)\\n```\\n\\n**C++**\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {\\n        return n > 0 && !(n & (n-1));\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Python**\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n):\\n        return n > 0 and n & (n-1) == 0\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** <code>O(1)</code>\\n***Space Complexity :*** `O(1)`\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u2714\\uFE0F ***Solution - VI (Math)***\\n\\nOnly a power of 2 will be able to divide a larger power of 2.

Then, when you AND those together, you get zero, such as with:\\n\\n      1000 0000 0000 0000\\n    &  111 1111 1111 1111\\n      ==== ==== ==== ====\\n    = 0000 0000 0000 0000\\n\\nAny non-power-of-two input value (other than zero) will *not* give you zero when you perform that operation.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s try all the 4-bit combinations:\\n\\n         <----- binary ---->\\n     n      n    n-1   n&(n-1)\\n    --   ----   ----   -------\\n     0   0000   0111    0000 *\\n     1   0001   0000    0000 *\\n     2   0010   0001    0000 *\\n     3   0011   0010    0010\\n     4   0100   0011    0000 *\\n     5   0101   0100    0100\\n     6   0110   0101    0100\\n     7   0111   0110    0110\\n     8   1000   0111    0000 *\\n     9   1001   1000    1000\\n    10   1010   1001    1000\\n    11   1011   1010    1010\\n    12   1100   1011    1000\\n    13   1101   1100    1100\\n    14   1110   1101    1100\\n    15   1111   1110    1110\\n\\nYou can see that only `0` and the powers of two (`1`, `2`, `4` and `8`) result in a `0000/false` bit pattern, all others are non-zero or `true`.\\n",

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe problem of determining whether a given integer is a power of two or not can be solved using the binary representation of the integer.\\n\\nA power of two can be represented as a binary number that has only one bit set to 1. For example, 2^3 = 8 is represented as 0b1000, which has only one bit set to 1.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a non-power of two integer will have more than one bit set to 1 in its binary representation. For example, 6 is represented as 0b0110, which has two bits set to 1.\\n\\nUsing this insight, we can develop an algorithm to determine whether a given integer is a power of two or not. The algorithm involves checking whether the given integer has only one bit set to 1 in its binary representation. We can do this by performing a bitwise AND operation between the integer and its decrement (i.e., n-1), which clears the rightmost set bit of the number. If the result of the bitwise AND operation is 0, then the original number was a power of two.\\n\\nOverall, the problem of determining whether an integer is a power of two or not can be solved efficiently using bitwise operations and the binary representation of the integer.\\n\\n# Approach\\nThe approach used in the code is based on the fact that a power of two has only one bit set in its binary representation. For example, 2^3 = 8 is represented as 0b1000 (in binary) which has only one bit set to 1.\\n\\nHere\\'s how the code works:\\n\\n- First, it checks if the given integer n is greater than 0. If n is not greater than 0, it cannot be a power of two.\\n- Next, it checks if the bitwise AND operation between n and n-1 is equal to 0. This operation clears the rightmost 1 bit in n. If the result is 0, then it means that there was only one bit set in n (i.e., n was a power of 2).\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s take n = 8 (which is 2^3). The binary representation of 8 is 0b1000. If we subtract 1 from 8, we get 7 which is represented as 0b0111. Now, if we do the bitwise AND operation between 8 and 7, we get 0b0000 which is equal to 0. This means that 8 is a power of 2.\\n\\nSimilarly, let\\'s take n = 6. The binary representation of 6 is 0b0110. If we subtract 1 from 6, we get 5 which is represented as 0b0101. Now, if we do the bitwise AND operation between 6 and 5, we get 0b0100 which is not equal to 0. This means that 6 is not a power of 2.\\n\\nTherefore, the code returns true if n is a power of 2, and false otherwise.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(1)$$\\n- The code consists of a single line, which involves two operations: a comparison and a bitwise AND.\\n- Both of these operations take constant time, regardless of the size of the input.\\n- Therefore, the time complexity of the code is O(1), which is constant time complexity.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n- The code only uses a single integer variable to store the input value n.\\n- Therefore, the space complexity of the code is O(1), which is constant space complexity.\\n\\n# Code\\n\\n```python3 []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:\\n        return (n>0) and (n & n-1 == 0)\\n```\\n\\n```java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {\\n         return n > 0 && (n & n - 1) == 0;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/eb0272a3-e9e4-4592-84a8-16353e35b407_1678595390.6430748.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Connect\\nLinkedIn : www.linkedin.com/in/akashjana\\n\\n---\\n#### Please consider upvoting if you find this helpful.

This might not work for bigger numbers as we would have to get all factors and check for primality, resulting in very bad time and space complexities.\\n\\n# Approach 2 (Divisibility)\\nNumbers that are Power of 2 will be divisible by two unless it reaches 1. So we can keep dividing the number by 2 unless we get 1. If we encounter an remainder in the process, it makes our assumption void and the number isn\\'t a power of 2.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {\\n        while(n>1){\\n            if(n%2==1){\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n            else{\\n                n/=2;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return (n==1);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n# Approach 3 (Math)\\nPowers of 2, give whole number result on calculating their Logarithm with base 2.

For powers of 2 , we can infer that their Binary representation will always have only one 1. (i.e. one set-bit).\\nSo, we may find the binary and count the number of 1s in the form.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {\\n        if(n<=0)return false; // base condition\\n        int set_bits=0;\\n        while(n){\\n            int r=n%2;\\n            if(r)set_bits++;\\n            n/=2;\\n        }\\n        return (set_bits==1);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n# Approach 5 (Bit Manipulation II - C++ One liner)\\nWe can use **builtin_popcount()** method given with C++ compiler to directly get the number of set-bits from a given input number.\\nUsing Ternary operator makes it even lesser to code **;-)** \\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {\\n        return (n>0?__builtin_popcount(n)==1:false);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n# Approach 6 (Bit Manipulation - III )\\nConsider any Power of 2, say 8. \\nBinary representation of 8 is **1000** .\\nNow lets see Binary representation of n-1, i.e 7 , which is **0111**\\nSo, on performing N & (N-1), we should have Zero as output if our N is a power of 2.\\nFor any non-power of 2, we will always get a value other than Zero (i.e. 5 & 4 = 4).\\nSo it is a valid test .\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {\\n        if(n<=0)\\n            return false;\\n        return ((n & (n-1)) == 0);\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

If it is, the method immediately returns \"false\" because 0 and negative numbers cannot be powers of two.\\n\\n- If \"n\" is greater than 0, the method proceeds to the next line. This line performs a bitwise AND operation between \"n\" and \"n-1\". The bitwise AND operator (&) compares the binary representation of the two operands and returns a new binary number where each bit is 1 only if the corresponding bits in both operands are also 1.\\n\\n- If \"n\" is a power of two, it will only have a single 1 bit in its binary representation. For example, 2 (10 in binary) and 8 (1000 in binary) are both powers of two. In contrast, 3 (11 in binary) and 5 (101 in binary) are not powers of two.\\n\\n- When we subtract 1 from a power of two, we get a binary number with all 1\\'s up to the position of the original 1, and then all 0\\'s after that. For example, if we subtract 1 from 8 (1000 in binary), we get 7 (111 in binary).\\n\\n- When we perform a bitwise AND operation between a power of two and one less than it, we get a result that has all 0\\'s except for the bit that represents the power of two. For example, if we perform the operation (8 & 7), we get 0 (0000 in binary) because all the bits except for the one that represents 8 are 0.\\n\\n- Therefore, if the result of the bitwise AND operation between \"n\" and \"n-1\" is equal to 0, then \"n\" must be a power of two. If the result is not 0, then \"n\" is not a power of two.\\n\\nThe method returns \"true\" if \"n\" is a power of two and \"false\" otherwise.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(1)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(1)\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {\\n        if (n <= 0) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        return (n & (n - 1)) == 0;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

                "content": "Hey there,\\n\\nI would like to share multiple ways to approach this problem:\\n\\n### **1. Using bit manipulation**\\nFirst of all, If we check how powers of 2 are represented in the binary format, we can quickly notice that:\\n```\\n1 = 1\\n2 = 10\\n4 = 100\\n8 = 1000\\n16 = 10000\\n```\\n\\nThey all have **1 bit** of the left side and the **rest are zeros.**\\n\\nGiven that, we can assume that if we **substract 1**  from that number, the leftmost **1 bit** will become **0** and the **rest** will become **1**.\\nFor example:\\n**1**0000 will become\\n**0**1111\\n\\nSo, they look sort of **inverted**\\nNow, if we just try to find any **common bits (&)** between them, there should be **none**.\\n\\nE.g:\\n`10000` \\n&\\n`01111`\\nwil be\\n`00000`\\n\\nIf there is no **common bits**, it means it\\'s a power of 2, otherwise not.\\n\\nIn JavaScript, implementation might look like this:\\n\\n```\\nvar isPowerOfTwo = function(n) {\\n    if (n == 0) {\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n    \\n    return (n & (n -1)) === 0\\n};\\n```\\n\\nHere is little nuance, 32-bits (`01111111111111111111111111111111`) can represend up-to `2147483647`.\\nTo hold larger numbers we have to use data-structures that uses more bits, like `long`\\nIn JavaScript, we have **[BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)**\\n\\n```\\nvar isPowerOfTwo = function(n) {\\n    n = BigInt(n)\\n    if (n == 0) {\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n    \\n    return (n & (n - BigInt(1))) === BigInt(0)\\n};\\n```\\n\\nTime: O(1)\\nSpace: O(1)\\n\\n### **2. Using logarithm**\\n\\nIn mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation.\\nIt\\'s essentially tells to which **power** we needs to put the **base** to get the **target** number.\\n\\n**Examples:**\\nLog2(4) means to which **power** we need to put 2(base) to get 4 (target) which is 2\\nLog2(8) means to which **power** we need to put 2(base) to get 8 (target) which is 3\\n\\nSo, base on it, we can assume, if `Log2(N)` returns an **interger** number, it\\'s a power of 2.\\nIf it returns rational number, it means it\\'s not.\\n\\nJavaScript implementation might look like this:\\n```\\nvar isPowerOfTwo = function(n) {\\n    if (n == 1) {\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n   let power = Math.log2(n)\\n   return power === parseInt(power, 10)\\n};\\n```\\nTime: O(1) - assuming that log2 uses a hardcoded table of values\\nSpace: O(1)\\n\\n\\nI hope it was helpful.\\nI would appreciate if you could upvote it if you find this useful.\\nThanks!",

A positive integer is considered a power of two if it can be written as 2^k for some integer k.

When the input is even, it has atleast one \\'0\\' from the right most bit. So we are **right shifting** the zeros till we get a \\'1\\' in the right most bit. If it is the only \\'1\\' and everything previous to it is \\'0\\', then definitly the original number can be represented by *2^n*.\\n3. input = 1 is a special cases, we will handle it separately.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: *O(log N)*\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1)\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {\\n        if(n == 1)\\n            return true;\\n        if(n % 2 != 0)\\n            return false;\\n        while(n != 0){\\n            if(n%2 != 0){\\n                n = n>>1;\\n                if(n == 0)\\n                    return true;\\n                else\\n                    return false;\\n            }\\n            else\\n              n = n>>1;\\n        }\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n*Please Upvote if the code and explanation is helpful to you*",

                "content": "# Approach\\nThe given code is a Java implementation of a method called `isPowerOfTwo` which determines whether a given integer `n` is a power of two or not. Let\\'s break down the code and explain it step by step:\\n\\n1. The code declares a class named `Solution`, which typically contains the solution or implementation of a specific problem or task.\\n\\n2. Inside the `Solution` class, there is a public method called `isPowerOfTwo` that takes an integer `n` as a parameter and returns a boolean value.\\n\\n3. The first `if` statement checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, then it means that `n` is a power of two (specifically 2^0 = 1), and thus the method returns `true`.\\n\\n4. The second `else if` statement checks if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, then `n` is not a power of two because any power of two is greater than zero. Therefore, the method returns `false`.\\n\\n5. The third `else if` statement checks if `n` is odd, i.e., `n % 2` is not equal to 0. If `n` is odd, it cannot be a power of two because powers of two are always even. In this case, the method returns `false`.\\n\\n6. If none of the above conditions are met, it means that `n` is even and greater than 1. In such cases, the code recursively calls the `isPowerOfTwo` method with the value of `n/2`. This recursive call continues until one of the base cases (n=1 or n=0) is reached.\\n\\n7. The recursion essentially divides `n` by 2 repeatedly until it either becomes 1 (which indicates that it was a power of two) or reaches 0 (which indicates that it was not a power of two). The recursive call helps in checking the divisibility of `n` by 2 and ensuring that the number is continuously reduced until a base case is encountered.\\n\\n8. If the recursive call eventually returns `true`, it means that `n` was a power of two, and the method will propagate this `true` value back through the chain of recursive calls.\\n\\n9. If the recursive call returns `false`, it means that `n` was not a power of two, and this `false` value will propagate back through the recursive calls until reaching the original call.\\n\\n10. Finally, the last `else` statement serves as a catch-all to handle any unexpected cases. In this case, it is not strictly necessary because the previous conditions already cover all possible scenarios.\\n\\nIn summary, the code uses recursion to check if a given integer `n` is a power of two by dividing it by 2 repeatedly until it reaches 1 or 0. If it reaches 1, the method returns `true`, indicating that `n` was a power of two. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {\\n        if(n == 1){\\n            return true;\\n        }\\n        else if(n == 0){\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        else if(n%2 != 0){\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        else{\\n            return isPowerOfTwo(n/2);\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n**Please upvote if you like the solution.\\nHappy Coding!** \\uD83D\\uDE0A",

This is my reasoning:\\n\\nAt a power of 2, we only have one bit set to 1 at its respective decimal place (e.g. 1000).\\nAt the power of 2 minus 1, we have **all the bits before the current decimal place set to 1 (e.g. 0111)**, which means that `n & (n - 1) == 0` for powers of 2. \\nThe reason why this happens is because we\\'re in the binary number system and a power of 2 means we\\'re going to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000).\\n\\nWhat about when n is not a power of 2? If you look at a list of binary numbers:\\n\\n0100\\n0101\\n0110\\n0111\\n1000\\n\\nRemember how the power of 2 is the special case where adding 1 results in us moving to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000)? Since every other case doesn\\'t result in that, there is at least the current power of 2\\'s 1 bit overlapping with whatever the number is (i.e. we\\'re at 0100, 0101 will always share the 0100 bit. The only time the 0100 bit becomes 0 again is if we go to the next power of 2).\\n\\nI hope this made sense!\\n"

This is my reasoning:\\n\\nAt a power of 2, we only have one bit set to 1 at its respective decimal place (e.g. 1000).\\nAt the power of 2 minus 1, we have **all the bits before the current decimal place set to 1 (e.g. 0111)**, which means that `n & (n - 1) == 0` for powers of 2. \\nThe reason why this happens is because we\\'re in the binary number system and a power of 2 means we\\'re going to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000).\\n\\nWhat about when n is not a power of 2? If you look at a list of binary numbers:\\n\\n0100\\n0101\\n0110\\n0111\\n1000\\n\\nRemember how the power of 2 is the special case where adding 1 results in us moving to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000)? Since every other case doesn\\'t result in that, there is at least the current power of 2\\'s 1 bit overlapping with whatever the number is (i.e. we\\'re at 0100, 0101 will always share the 0100 bit.

If you look at a list of binary numbers:\\n\\n0100\\n0101\\n0110\\n0111\\n1000\\n\\nRemember how the power of 2 is the special case where adding 1 results in us moving to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000)?

This is my reasoning:\\n\\nAt a power of 2, we only have one bit set to 1 at its respective decimal place (e.g. 1000).\\nAt the power of 2 minus 1, we have **all the bits before the current decimal place set to 1 (e.g. 0111)**, which means that `n & (n - 1) == 0` for powers of 2. \\nThe reason why this happens is because we\\'re in the binary number system and a power of 2 means we\\'re going to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000).\\n\\nWhat about when n is not a power of 2? If you look at a list of binary numbers:\\n\\n0100\\n0101\\n0110\\n0111\\n1000\\n\\nRemember how the power of 2 is the special case where adding 1 results in us moving to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000)? Since every other case doesn\\'t result in that, there is at least the current power of 2\\'s 1 bit overlapping with whatever the number is (i.e. we\\'re at 0100, 0101 will always share the 0100 bit.

Since every other case doesn\\'t result in that, there is at least the current power of 2\\'s 1 bit overlapping with whatever the number is (i.e. we\\'re at 0100, 0101 will always share the 0100 bit. The only time the 0100 bit becomes 0 again is if we go to the next power of 2).\\n\\nI hope this made sense!\\n"

If you look at a list of binary numbers:\\n\\n0100\\n0101\\n0110\\n0111\\n1000\\n\\nRemember how the power of 2 is the special case where adding 1 results in us moving to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000)?

This is my reasoning:\\n\\nAt a power of 2, we only have one bit set to 1 at its respective decimal place (e.g. 1000).\\nAt the power of 2 minus 1, we have **all the bits before the current decimal place set to 1 (e.g. 0111)**, which means that `n & (n - 1) == 0` for powers of 2. \\nThe reason why this happens is because we\\'re in the binary number system and a power of 2 means we\\'re going to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000).\\n\\nWhat about when n is not a power of 2? If you look at a list of binary numbers:\\n\\n0100\\n0101\\n0110\\n0111\\n1000\\n\\nRemember how the power of 2 is the special case where adding 1 results in us moving to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000)? Since every other case doesn\\'t result in that, there is at least the current power of 2\\'s 1 bit overlapping with whatever the number is (i.e. we\\'re at 0100, 0101 will always share the 0100 bit.

This is my reasoning:\\n\\nAt a power of 2, we only have one bit set to 1 at its respective decimal place (e.g. 1000).\\nAt the power of 2 minus 1, we have **all the bits before the current decimal place set to 1 (e.g. 0111)**, which means that `n & (n - 1) == 0` for powers of 2. \\nThe reason why this happens is because we\\'re in the binary number system and a power of 2 means we\\'re going to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000).\\n\\nWhat about when n is not a power of 2? If you look at a list of binary numbers:\\n\\n0100\\n0101\\n0110\\n0111\\n1000\\n\\nRemember how the power of 2 is the special case where adding 1 results in us moving to the next decimal place (i.e. 0111 + 1 = 1000)? Since every other case doesn\\'t result in that, there is at least the current power of 2\\'s 1 bit overlapping with whatever the number is (i.e. we\\'re at 0100, 0101 will always share the 0100 bit. The only time the 0100 bit becomes 0 again is if we go to the next power of 2).\\n\\nI hope this made sense!\\n"

Then we check if the root has been fully explored, which should eventually be a single `#`. During absorbing, if this pattern appears `#,#,#`, return false. It's known that it's a pain in C++ that there is no split function as Java does, but it won't matter here since split string is not necessary, we just need to know before `,` it's a `number` or `#`.\\n\\n\"9,3,4,#,#,12,#,#,2,#,6,#,#\"\\n\\nstack status\\n\\n    char   stack\\n    '9':   '9'  \\n    '3':   '3','9'\\n    '4':   '4','3','9'\\n    '#':   '#','4','3','9'\\n    '#':   '#','3','9'\\n    '12':  'n', '#', '3','9'\\n    '#':   '#','1', '#', '3','9'\\n    '#':   '#','3','9' -> '#','9'\\n    '2':   '2', '#','9'\\n    '#':   '#', '2', '#','9'\\n    '6':   '6', '#', '2','#','9'\\n    '#':   '#', '6', '#', '2','#','9'\\n    '#':   '#', '2','#','9' -> '#','9' -> '#'\\n\\nCode:\\n\\n    class Solution {\\n    public:\\n        bool isValidSerialization(string preorder) {\\n            stack<char> stk;\\n            bool isNum = false;\\n            preorder.push_back(','); // dummy tail\\n            \\n            for(auto c: preorder){\\n                if(c == '#'){\\n                    // absorb: search for pattern `#, number` backward\\n                    while(!stk.empty() && stk.top() == '#'){ \\n                        stk.pop(); // pop `#`\\n                        if(stk.empty() || stk.top() == '#') return false; // pattern `#,#,#`\\n                        stk.pop(); // pop `number`\\n                    }\\n                    stk.push('#'); // replace `number` with `#` since it has been fully explored/validated\\n                }else if(c == ','){\\n                    if(isNum) stk.push('n'); // indicate this is a number instead of using the real number\\n                    isNum = false;\\n                }else{\\n                    isNum = true;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            \\n            return stk.size() == 1 && stk.top() == '#';\\n        }\\n    };",

By adding an inner node, an extra outlet is introduced in a binary tree (+1).

Given there was an initialy inlet (which requires 1 outlet) and each inner node introduces an extra outlet, `1 + inner` leaf nodes are required for the balance. Of course, end result alone is not enough. One also need to check the intermediate state. Namely, at any state before the end, one would require positive number of outlets. \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isValidSerialization(self, preorder: str) -> bool:\\n        outlet = 1\\n        for x in preorder.split(\",\"): \\n            if outlet == 0: return False #intermediate \\n            outlet += 1 if x != \"#\" else -1\\n        return outlet == 0  #end result \\n```\\n\\nApproach 2 - reconstruction \\nAlternatively, one could somewhat reconstruct the tree via a stack. \\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isValidSerialization(self, preorder: str) -> bool:\\n        stack = []\\n        for n in preorder.split(\",\"):\\n            stack.append(n)\\n            while stack[-2:] == [\"#\", \"#\"]: \\n                stack.pop()\\n                stack.pop()\\n                if not stack: return False \\n                stack[-1] = \"#\"\\n        return stack == [\"#\"]\\n```",

Whenever you add a node, you replace a null node with a non null node, then you add two null nodes to your new node, for a net difference between non null and null nodes per node insertion is 0. \\n\\nThe tree with one value had 1 more null than non null, so any valid tree must also have 1 more null than non null. Additionally, the final node of the pre order must be null no matter what. If it isn't then that means there are more nodes, which means its not the final node. This means that before reaching the final node, there must always be equal amounts of non nulls and nulls. \\n\\nIf we consider adding a non null node to be +1 and adding a non null to be -1, the final tree must have a balance of -1. Because non null nodes are added before the null nodes are, the balance of the tree should never go negative until the final node is reached. \\n\\nThis code uses stringstream to iterate through the values and continuously adds to the balance of the tree. If the balance goes negative, it breaks and returns true only if the end of the serialization was reached. It also returns false if the balance is not -1 even if the end of the serialization was reached. \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isValidSerialization(string preorder) {\\n        int bal = 0;\\n        stringstream ss(preorder);\\n        string val;\\n        while(getline(ss,val,',')){\\n            bal += val == \"#\" ? -1 : 1;\\n            if (bal < 0) break;\\n        }\\n        string check;\\n        return bal == -1 && !(bool)getline(ss,check,',');\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

And also a step up the classic [valid parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/) problem, [solved here](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/discuss/1025908/)).\\n\\nMy intuition here was initially to use a stack, then I found it unnecessary and opted for a counter for each direction, but before I even began coding it, it dawned to me how to proceed: all that we need is to keep track of how many `nodes` we encounter and know that each one of them has to terminate with either another node or `\\'#\\'`.\\n\\nBut since, recursively, each new node would still need the same condition, we will figure out that from that that the number of nodes in a valid tree is equal to the amount of `\\'#\\'` plus `1`.\\n\\nFurthermore, we can never encounter more `\\'#\\'` than nodes we have seen so far, so we need to check for that.\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we will handle first the edge case of an input starting with `\\'#\\'` itself: this tree will be valid only if it is the only character in `s`.\\n\\nWith that checked, we can now be sure that the first node is a non-null one and since we just explained that we want the amount of nulls to be always `1` more than the the actual nodes met, we can initialise the variable `nodes` with the value of `2` (`1` from the root node, plus another `1` to make it \"even\" with the expected nulls in a valid tree).\\n\\nWe will then loop through `s` with the pointer `i` initially set to `1` up to `lmt` (the size of our initial input) and every time we spot a `\\',\\'` we will:*\\n* check if the next character is a null (`\\'#\\'`) in which case we will decrease `nodes` by `1` and:\\n\\t* check if `nodes == 0`, in which case we will `return` `true` only if it was the last node (ie: `i + 2 == lmt`), `false` otherwise;\\n* otherwise, increase `nodes` by `1`;\\n* increase `i` (we want to move at least 2 steps after a comma).\\n\\nOnce done, we will `return` `true` only if `nodes == 0` (ie: we found a balanced tree), `false` otherwise.\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isValidSerialization(string s) {\\n        // edge case off\\n        if (s[0] == \\'#\\') return s.size()  == 1;\\n        // support variables\\n        int nodes = 2;\\n        // parsing s\\n        for (int i = 1, lmt = s.size(); i < lmt; i++) {\\n            // detecting a new node\\n            if (s[i] == \\',\\') {\\n                // finding a null\\n                if (s[i + 1] == \\'#\\') {\\n                    nodes--;\\n                    if (!nodes) return i + 2 == lmt;\\n                }\\n                // finding a node\\n                else nodes++;\\n                i++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return !nodes;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

In the end, `st` should be empty, bcoz all nodes have 2 children assigned\\n\\nCode:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean isValidSerialization(String preorder) {   \\n        if(preorder.length()==1) return preorder.charAt(0) == \\'#\\';\\n        String[] parts = preorder.split(\",\");\\n        if(parts.length % 2 == 0) return false; // total entries will always be odd if it is valid\\n        \\n        Deque<Integer> st = new LinkedList<>();\\n        for(String str: parts) {\\n            if(str.equals(\"#\")) {\\n                if(st.isEmpty()) \\n                    return false;\\n                int curr = st.pop();\\n                curr++;\\n                if(curr < 2)\\n                    st.push(curr);\\n            } else {\\n                if(st.isEmpty()) {\\n                    st.push(0);\\n                } else {\\n                    int curr = st.pop();\\n                    curr++;\\n                    if(curr < 2) {\\n                        st.push(curr);\\n                    }\\n                    st.push(0);\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return st.isEmpty();\\n        \\n    }\\n}\\n```",
