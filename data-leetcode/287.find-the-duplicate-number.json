If we can get **each digit** of the repeated number in binary, we can rebuild the repeated number.\\n\\nCount all the bits of $[1, n]$ and array numbers as $1$ respectively, and then restore them bit by bit to get this repeated number.\\n\\nFor example, the $i$th digit, note that in the $\\\\textit{nums}$ array, the sum of all the elements whose ith digit is $1$ is $x$ as convert the number to binary. \\n\\nAs the range $[1, n]$, we can also count the sum of the number whose $i$th digit is $1$, we denoted it $y$.\\n\\nWe can easily get that $x > y$.\\n\\nThe following table lists whether each bit in the binary of each number is $1$ or $0$ and what the $x$ and $y$ of the corresponding bit are:\\n\\n\\n|\\t \\t|    1   |    3   |    4   |    2   |    2   |    x   |    y   |\\n|:-----\\t| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |\\n| Bit 0 |    1   |    1   |    0   |    0   |    0   |    2   |    2   |\\n| Bit 1 |    1   |    0   |    1   |    1   |    1   |    3   |    2   |\\n| Bit 2 |    0   |    0   |    1   |    0   |    0   |    1   |    1   |\\n\\nFrom the table, we found that only the $1$th bit $x > y$, so after bitwise restoration $\\\\textit{target}=(010)_2=(2)_{10}$, which is the answer.\\n\\nThe proof of correctness is actually similar to method $1$. We can consider the change of the number $x$ of the $i$-th in different example arrays.\\n\\n- If $\\\\textit{target}$ appears twice in the test case array, the rest of the numbers appear once, and the $i$th bit of $\\\\textit{target}$ is $1$, then the $\\\\textit{nums}$ array x, is exactly one greater than y. If bit $i$ of \\\\textit{target} is $0$, then both are equal.\\n\\n- If $\\\\textit{target}$ appears three or more times in the array of test cases, then there must be some numbers that are not in the $\\\\textit{nums}$ array. At this time, it is equivalent to replacing these with $\\\\textit{target}$, we consider the impact on $x$ when replacing:\\n\\n\\t- If the $i$-th bit of the number to be replaced is $1$, and the $i$-th bit of $\\\\textit{target}$ is $1$: $x$ remains unchanged, $x > y$.\\n\\n\\t- If the $i$-th bit of the number being replaced is $0$, and the $i$-th bit of $\\\\textit{target}$ is $1$: x plus one, $x > y$.\\n\\n\\t- If the i-th bit of the number to be replaced is $1$, and the $i$-th bit of $\\\\textit{target}$ is $0$: $x$ minus one, $x \\\\le y$.\\n\\n\\t- If the $i$-th bit of the number to be replaced is $0$, and the $i$-th bit of $\\\\textit{target}$ is $0$: x remains unchanged, satisfying $x \\\\le y$.\\n\\nTherefore, if the ith bit of $\\\\textit{target}$ is $1$, then after each replacement, only $x$ will be unchanged or increased. If it is $0$, only $x$ will be unchanged or decreased.\\n\\nWhen $x > y$, the ith bit of $\\\\textit{target}$ is $1$, otherwise it is $0$. We only need to restore this repeated number bitwise.\\n\\nWith extra $O(nlogn)$ space, without modifying the input.\\n\\n```java\\n    public static int findDuplicate_bit(int[] nums) {\\n        int n = nums.length;\\n        int ans = 0;\\n        int bit_max = 31;\\n        while (((n - 1) >> bit_max) == 0) {\\n            bit_max -= 1;\\n        }\\n\\n        for (int bit = 0; bit <= bit_max; ++bit) {\\n            int x = 0, y = 0;\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\\n                if ((nums[i] & (1 << bit)) != 0) {\\n                    x += 1;\\n                }\\n                if (i >= 1 && ((i & (1 << bit)) != 0)) {\\n                    y += 1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            if (x > y) {\\n                ans |= 1 << bit;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n## Analysis\\n\\n- **Time Complexity**: $O(nlogn)$\\n- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$\\n\\n\\n# Fast Slow Pointers\\n\\nThis problem is as same as [142.

// by 1 steps\\n\\n**fast pointer will be updated** as \\n\\n**fast = nums[nums[fast]]**; // by 2 steps\\n\\nso now we are at a **point where they both meet** and hence the **first collision point.**\\n\\nNow to **find the starting of cycle , i.e\\nThe second collision** is when we **move both the pointer by 1** (For Finding the Starting point)\\n\\nbut before that when are fast and slow pointer meets then the **slow pointer have covered a dist of let say x**, and the **fast pointer have covered the dist of 2x**. So the **difference of distance travel by both fast and slow is x**, and we can say this **x is the multiple of the length of the cycle** because fast and slow are meeting at  any point in the cycle and **they will only meet if differece of distance between them is a multiple of length of cycle.**\\n\\nso for **finding the second collision we keep the fast pointer at start and the slow remains at the first collison point** and now **both will move by 1 steps till both slow and fast becomes equal**, and now  slow will be the start of the cycle and is the repeated element.\\n\\n**so now the question is when both fast and slow meet again how it be the starting element of linkedlist ?**\\n\\nas i proved earlier that the difference of distance of fast and slow is x (multilple of length of cycle), so when they meet the fast pointer has already moved an extra x(dist) than slow and we can easily say x  is the multiple of length of cycle.\\n\\n**x = n C (x is a multiple of length of Cycle C)**\\n\\n\\nnow **assume the distance from start to duplicate** is **\\'a\\'** so the **distance from duplicate  to first collision is \\'x - a\\';**\\n\\nnow to **find the second collison we are keeping the fast pointer at  start and  moving fast and slow by 1**, so now **if the duplicate is at dist a** so the **fast pointer will move a dist of a** and the **slow pointer is at x - a it will also move a dist of a**\\ni.e *x - a  + a* **that is x** and **this x is the multiple of lenght of cycle** so we can say that when we start fast pointer from starting point and slow pointer from first collison point **they are bound to meet at the duplicate element i.e the start of the cycle**.\\n\\n\\n**Time Complexity -> O(N)\\nSpace Complextiy -> O(1)**\\n\\n**Code**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        \\n        int fast = nums[0];\\n        int slow = nums[0];\\n        \\n        do{\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n        }while(fast != slow);\\n        \\n        fast = nums[0];\\n        \\n        while(fast != slow)\\n        {\\n            fast = nums[fast];\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n        }\\n        \\n        return slow;\\n        \\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "For me the main difficulty was that given tests are not clear at all: both of them have only one duplicate, however there can be examples like `2,2,2,2,3`. \\nWhy there always will be duplicate? Because of Pigeonhole principle! Actually, it can be proven very easily: let us assume that it not correct: it means, that each number between `1` and `n` can have frequency only `0` of `1`. It means, that there will be `<= n` numbers, but we need to have `n+1`. Contradiction: so, our assumption is correct: there will be at least one duplicate number.\\n\\nOne way to handle this problem is to sort data with `O(n log n)` time and `O(n)` memory or use hash table. Howerer it violates the conditions of problem: we can not use extra memory. There is smarter way and we need to use the fact that each integer is **between 1 and n**, which we did not use in sort.\\n\\nLet us deal our list as linked list, where `i` is connected with `nums[i]`.\\nConsider example `6, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5, 2`. Then we have the following singly-linked list:\\n`0 -> 6 -> 5 ->` **2** `-> 4 -> 3 -> 1 ->` **2** `-> ...` \\nWe start with index **0**, look what is inside? it is number `6`, so we look at index number **6**, what is inside? Number **5** and so on. Look at the image below for better understanding.\\nSo the goal is to find loop in this linkes list. Why there will be always loop? Because `nums[1] = nums[5]` in our case, and similarly there will be always duplicate, and it is given that it is only one.\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/7abc4538-ec0e-4713-a525-343584c6b3f3_1593079845.8204632.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo now, the problem is to find the starting point of loop in singly-linked list (**problem 142**), which has a classical solution with two pointers: slow which moves one step at a time and fast, which moves two times at a time. To find this place we need to do it in two iterations: first we wait until fast pointer gains slow pointer and then we move slow pointer to the start and run them with the same speed and wait until they concide.\\n\\n**Complexity**: Time complexity is `O(n)`, because we potentially can traverse all list. Space complexity is `O(1)`, because we actually do not use any extra space: our linked list is **virtual**.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findDuplicate(self, nums):\\n        slow, fast = nums[0], nums[0]\\n        while True:\\n            slow, fast = nums[slow], nums[nums[fast]]\\n            if slow == fast: break\\n           \\n        slow = nums[0];\\n        while slow != fast:\\n            slow, fast = nums[slow], nums[fast]\\n        return slow\\n```\\n\\n### Binary search solution\\n\\nThere is **Binary Search** solution with time complexity `O(n log n)` and space complexity `O(1)`. We have numbers from `1` to `n`. Let us choose middle element `m = n//2` and count number of elements in list, which are less or equal than `m`. If we have `m+1` of them it means we need to search for duplicate in `[1,m]` range, else in `[m+1,n]` range. Each time we reduce searching range twice, but each time we go over **all** data. So overall complexity is `O(n log n)`. \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def findDuplicate(self, nums):\\n        beg, end = 1, len(nums)-1\\n        \\n        while beg + 1 <= end:\\n            mid, count = (beg + end)//2, 0\\n            for num in nums:\\n                if num <= mid: count += 1        \\n            if count <= mid:\\n                beg = mid + 1\\n            else:\\n                end = mid\\n        return end\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Fast-Slow Pointers Approach (Floyd\\'s Cycle Detection)\\n\\n### Detailed Logic Behind the Fast-Slow Pointers Approach\\n\\n**Step 1: Initialize Pointers**\\nFirst, we initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both set to `nums[0]`. This is the starting point for both pointers, and it\\'s done to set up the conditions for Floyd\\'s cycle detection algorithm.\\n\\n**Step 2: Detect a Cycle**\\nIn this step, we enter a `while` loop where the `slow` pointer moves one step at a time (`slow = nums[slow]`), while the `fast` pointer moves two steps (`fast = nums[nums[fast]]`). The loop continues until both pointers meet at some point within the cycle. Note that this meeting point is not necessarily the duplicate number; it\\'s just a point inside the cycle.\\n\\nWhy does this happen? Because there is a duplicate number, there must be a cycle in the \\'linked list\\' created by following `nums[i]` as next elements. Once a cycle is detected, the algorithm breaks out of this loop.\\n\\n**Step 3: Find the Start of the Cycle (Duplicate Number)**\\nAfter identifying a meeting point inside the cycle, we reinitialize the `slow` pointer back to `nums[0]`. The `fast` pointer stays at the last meeting point. Now, we enter another `while` loop where both pointers move one step at a time. The reason behind this is mathematical: according to Floyd\\'s cycle detection algorithm, when both pointers move at the same speed, they will eventually meet at the starting point of the cycle. This is the duplicate number we are looking for.\\n\\n**Step 4: Return the Duplicate Number**\\nFinally, when the `slow` and `fast` pointers meet again, the meeting point will be the duplicate number, and we return it as the output.\\n\\n#### Pros:\\n- Adheres to the constant space constraint.\\n- Doesn\\'t modify the original array.\\n\\n#### Cons:\\n- The logic can be slightly tricky to grasp initially.\\n\\n#### Time and Space Complexity:\\n- **Time Complexity**: $$O(n)$$, where $$ n $$ is the length of the array.\\n- **Space Complexity**: $$O(1)$$ as no extra space is required.\\n\\n## Code Fast Slow Pointers\\n``` Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        slow = nums[0]\\n        fast = nums[0]\\n\\n        while True:\\n            slow = nums[slow]\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]]\\n            if slow == fast:\\n                break\\n\\n        slow = nums[0]\\n        while slow != fast:\\n            slow = nums[slow]\\n            fast = nums[fast]\\n            \\n        return slow\\n```\\n``` Go []\\nfunc findDuplicate(nums []int) int {\\n    slow := nums[0]\\n    fast := nums[0]\\n    \\n    for {\\n        slow = nums[slow]\\n        fast = nums[nums[fast]]\\n        \\n        if slow == fast {\\n            break\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    slow = nums[0]\\n    for slow != fast {\\n        slow = nums[slow]\\n        fast = nums[fast]\\n    }\\n    \\n    return slow\\n}\\n```\\n``` Rust []\\nimpl Solution {\\n    pub fn find_duplicate(nums: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {\\n        let mut slow = nums[0];\\n        let mut fast = nums[0];\\n        \\n        loop {\\n            slow = nums[slow as usize];\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast as usize] as usize];\\n            \\n            if slow == fast {\\n                break;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        slow = nums[0];\\n        while slow != fast {\\n            slow = nums[slow as usize];\\n            fast = nums[fast as usize];\\n        }\\n        \\n        slow\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n``` C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int slow = nums[0];\\n        int fast = nums[0];\\n\\n        do {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n        } while (slow != fast);\\n\\n        slow = nums[0];\\n        while (slow != fast) {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[fast];\\n        }\\n\\n        return slow;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n``` Java []\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {\\n        int slow = nums[0];\\n        int fast = nums[0];\\n        \\n        do {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n        } while (slow != fast);\\n        \\n        slow = nums[0];\\n        while (slow != fast) {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[fast];\\n        }\\n        \\n        return slow;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n``` JavaScript []\\n/**\\n * @param {number[]} nums\\n * @return {number}\\n */\\nvar findDuplicate = function(nums) {\\n    let slow = nums[0];\\n    let fast = nums[0];\\n    \\n    do {\\n        slow = nums[slow];\\n        fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n    } while (slow !== fast);\\n    \\n    slow = nums[0];\\n    while (slow !== fast) {\\n        slow = nums[slow];\\n        fast = nums[fast];\\n    }\\n    \\n    return slow;\\n};\\n```\\n``` PHP []\\nclass Solution {\\n    function findDuplicate($nums) {\\n        $slow = $nums[0];\\n        $fast = $nums[0];\\n        \\n        do {\\n            $slow = $nums[$slow];\\n            $fast = $nums[$nums[$fast]];\\n        } while ($slow != $fast);\\n        \\n        $slow = $nums[0];\\n        while ($slow != $fast) {\\n            $slow = $nums[$slow];\\n            $fast = $nums[$fast];\\n        }\\n        \\n        return $slow;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n``` C# []\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public int FindDuplicate(int[] nums) {\\n        int slow = nums[0];\\n        int fast = nums[0];\\n        \\n        do {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n        } while (slow != fast);\\n        \\n        slow = nums[0];\\n        while (slow != fast) {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[fast];\\n        }\\n        \\n        return slow;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Binary Search Approach\\n\\n#### Detailed Logic:\\n1. Initialize `low` to 1 and `high` to $$ n $$.\\n2. Run a binary search loop until `low < high`:\\n    - Calculate `mid` as the midpoint between `low` and `high`.\\n    - Count elements in the array that are less than or equal to `mid`.\\n    - If the count is greater than `mid`, set `high = mid`. Otherwise, set `low = mid + 1`.\\n\\n#### Pros:\\n- No modification to the original array.\\n  \\n#### Cons:\\n- Somewhat more complex to understand due to binary search mechanics.\\n\\n#### Time and Space Complexity:\\n- **Time Complexity**: $$O(n \\\\log n)$$ due to binary search combined with array scanning.\\n- **Space Complexity**: $$O(1)$$ as no extra space is needed.\\n\\n\\n## Code Binary Search\\n``` Python \\nclass Solution:\\n    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        low, high = 1, len(nums) - 1\\n        \\n        while low < high:\\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\\n            count = 0\\n            for num in nums:\\n                if num <= mid:\\n                    count += 1\\n            if count > mid:\\n                high = mid\\n            else:\\n                low = mid + 1\\n                \\n        return low\\n\\n```\\n\\n## 6. Sort Approach\\n\\n#### Detailed Logic:\\n1. Sort the `nums` array in ascending order.\\n2. Traverse the sorted array and compare adjacent elements.\\n    - If two adjacent elements are equal, return one of them as the duplicate.\\n3. If no duplicate is found, return the length of the array (this should not happen under the problem constraints).\\n\\n#### Pros:\\n- Simple to understand and implement.\\n- Utilizes Python\\'s efficient built-in sorting algorithm.\\n\\n#### Cons:\\n- Modifies the original array by sorting it.\\n- Not the most time-efficient solution for this problem.\\n\\n#### Time and Space Complexity:\\n- **Time Complexity**: $$ O(n \\\\log n) $$ due to sorting.\\n- **Space Complexity**: $$ O(1) $$ if sorting is done in-place, otherwise $$ O(n) $$.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Code Sort\\n``` Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        nums.sort()\\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\\n            if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:\\n                return nums[i]\\n        return len(nums)\\n```\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\n| Language  | Time (ms) | Space (MB) | Approach         | \\n|-----------|-----------|------------|------------------|\\n| Java      | 4         | 56.8       | Fast Slow Pointers|                  |\\n| Rust      | 10        | 3.1        | Fast Slow Pointers|                  |\\n| JavaScript| 75        | 49.6       | Fast Slow Pointers|                  |\\n| C++       | 73        | 61.5       | Fast Slow Pointers\\n| Go        | 98        | 9.2        | Fast Slow Pointers|                  |\\n| C#        | 167       | 54.6       | Fast Slow Pointers|                  |\\n| PHP       | 179       | 31.7       | Fast Slow Pointers|                  |\\n| Java      | 20        | 61.2       | Set               |                  |\\n| Rust      | 26        | 4.1        | Set               |                  |\\n| C#        | 193       | 50.7       | Set               |                  |\\n| Go        | 100       | 9.2        | Set               |                  |\\n| JavaScript| 92        | 61.3       | Set               |                  |\\n| C++       | 135       | 84.2       | Set               |                  |\\n| Python3   | 495       | 32.3       | Set               |                  |\\n| Python3   | 518       | 31.1       | Fast Slow Pointers|                  |\\n| Python3   | 518       | 30.9       | Count             |                  |\\n| Python3   | 522       | 31.0       | Mark              |                  |\\n| Python3   | 564       | 31.1       | Sort              |                  |\\n| Python3   | 724       | 31.0       | Binary Search     |                  |\\n\\n![pl44.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/1f172996-462a-4849-b8b3-0ef697817fd1_1695085986.8572996.png)\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nEach strategy has its merits and demerits, and the choice of approach depends on the specific constraints of the problem.

Step 7 increment will be done as follows: ```slow = nums[slow]; fast = nums[fast]```.\\n9. The node at which both ```slow``` and ```fast``` will meet will be the duplicate number.\\n10. Return ```slow``` or ```fast``` :). \\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int slow = nums[0];\\n        int fast = nums[0];\\n        \\n        do\\n        {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n        }while(slow != fast);\\n        \\n        fast = nums[0];\\n        while(slow != fast)\\n        {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[fast];\\n        }\\n        \\n        return slow;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nI have tried my best to explain the algorithm. sorry for any mistakes.\\nPlz upvote and support my work.",

Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to the first element of the input list `nums`.\\n2. Iterate through the list using the Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare algorithm(See below) to find a cycle.\\n3. Once a cycle is found, reset one of the pointers to the beginning of the list and continue iterating until both pointers meet again.\\n\\nDetailed Explanation:\\n1. Initialize `slow` and `fast` pointers to the first element of the input list `nums`.\\n2. Enter a loop to detect a cycle:\\n   a. Update `slow` to the next element using `nums[slow]`.\\n   b. Update `fast` to the next element after `nums[fast]`, effectively moving two steps.\\n   c. Check if `slow` is equal to `fast`. If they are equal, a cycle has been found, and exit the loop.\\n3. After finding the cycle, reset one of the pointers (`slow2`) to the beginning of the list.\\n4. Enter a loop to find the duplicate element:\\n   a. Update `slow` using `nums[slow]`.\\n   b. Update `slow2` using `nums[slow2]`.\\n   c. Continue this process until `slow` is equal to `slow2`, which represents the duplicate element.\\n5. Return the duplicate element found (`slow`).\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare algorithm\\n\\nFloyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare algorithm, also known as Floyd\\'s Cycle Detection algorithm, is an algorithm used to detect loops (cycles) in data structures like linked lists or arrays. It has been proven to reliably detect cycles under specific circumstances and can be applied to finding duplicate elements.\\n\\nThis algorithm employs two pointers, referred to as the \"tortoise\" and the \"hare,\" to traverse the list.\\n\\n- **Tortoise**: A pointer that advances one step at a time through the list.\\n- **Hare**: A pointer that advances two steps at a time through the list.\\n\\nUsing these pointers, you progress until the hare catches up with the tortoise or a cycle is detected.\\n\\nHere\\'s an overview of the algorithm:\\n\\n1. **Phase 1 (Cycle Detection)**:\\n   Move the tortoise and hare, advancing the hare twice as fast as the tortoise, until the hare catches up with the tortoise or a cycle is detected. If a cycle is detected, reset the tortoise and move the hare back to its position before the reset.\\n\\n2. **Phase 2 (Cycle Start Detection)**:\\n   Move the tortoise and hare one step at a time until they match again. The position where they match again is the starting point of the cycle, corresponding to the duplicate element.\\n\\nLet\\'s explain why this works for the problem at hand:\\n\\n- **Properties of Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare Algorithm**:\\n   The algorithm ensures that the tortoise and hare will match again at some position in the list. Exploiting this property, if a cycle exists, the tortoise and hare will certainly match at some position within the cycle.\\n\\n- **Relation between Duplicate Element and Cycle**:\\n   In the presence of a duplicate element, the duplicate corresponds to the starting point of the cycle. Starting from the first element as the tortoise, and moving through the duplicates until reaching a duplicate (cycle start), the hare will join, and the tortoise and hare will match again inside the cycle.\\n\\nTherefore, the Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare Algorithm provides an efficient and reliable way to find duplicate elements.\\n\\nWe can apply the same algorithm to `Linked List cycle \\u2161`. I calculate movement distance of the two pointers with easy mathematics knowledge. I hope you can understand it easily and deeply.\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/eW5pVXX2dow\\n\\n---\\n\\n# How it works\\n\\n```\\nInput: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]\\n```\\n\\nInitialze `slow` and `fast` pointers with `nums[0]` \\n\\n```\\nslow = 1 (nums[0])\\nfast = 1 (nums[0])\\n```\\nStart iteration until the both pointers are the same value.\\n```\\nIteration 1:\\nslow: 3 (nums[1])\\nfast: 2 (nums[nums[1]] = nums[3])\\n\\nIteration 2:\\nslow: 2 (nums[3])\\nfast: 2 (nums[nums[2]] = nums[4])\\n\\nNow the both pointers are equal, so break the loop.\\n```\\n\\nSet `nums[0]` to `slow2` pointer.

When two pointers meet at `node z` then `fast pointer` is initialized with `node x` again and each pointer moves through path `A` or `C` one by one, so that we can find starting node of cycle which is `node y`.\\n\\n#### \\u2B50\\uFE0FLet\\'s apply this idea to this question.

For just in case, is there anyone who think why we need the second loop with slow and slow2? Because we found `2` in the first loop.\\n\\nThe second loop with `slow` and `slow2` is necessary to find the starting point of the cycle, which corresponds to the duplicate element in the array. Let me explain why this is needed:\\n\\nIn the first loop (cycle detection phase) using the Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare algorithm, we detect that there is a cycle in the array by finding a position where the slow and fast pointers meet. However, this position is not necessarily the starting point of the cycle or the duplicate element. It\\'s just a position within the cycle.\\n\\nThe second loop (cycle start detection phase) helps us find the actual starting point of the cycle, which is the duplicate element we are looking for. The starting point of the cycle is the position where the slow and slow2 pointers meet. This second loop is crucial to pinpoint the exact duplicate element in the array.\\n\\nWithout this second loop, we would have detected the presence of a cycle but would not have determined the duplicate element. The second loop is essential for identifying the duplicate element within the cycle.\\n\\nTry to run the code below with input `[2,5,9,6,9,3,8,9,7,1]`. We should return `9` and the first loop should stop at `7`.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n)\\n\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1)\\n\\n```python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        slow = nums[0]\\n        fast = nums[0]\\n        \\n        while True:\\n            slow = nums[slow]\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]]\\n            if slow == fast:\\n                break\\n        \\n        slow2 = nums[0]\\n        while slow != slow2:\\n            slow = nums[slow]\\n            slow2 = nums[slow2]\\n\\n        return slow\\n```\\n```javascript []\\n/**\\n * @param {number[]} nums\\n * @return {number}\\n */\\nvar findDuplicate = function(nums) {\\n    let slow = nums[0];\\n    let fast = nums[0];\\n\\n    while (true) {\\n        slow = nums[slow];\\n        fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n\\n        if (slow === fast) {\\n            break;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    let slow2 = nums[0];\\n\\n    while (slow !== slow2) {\\n        slow = nums[slow];\\n        slow2 = nums[slow2];\\n    }\\n\\n    return slow;    \\n};\\n```\\n```java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {\\n        int slow = nums[0];\\n        int fast = nums[0];\\n\\n        while (true) {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n\\n            if (slow == fast) {\\n                break;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        int slow2 = nums[0];\\n\\n        while (slow != slow2) {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            slow2 = nums[slow2];\\n        }\\n\\n        return slow;        \\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int slow = nums[0];\\n        int fast = nums[0];\\n\\n        while (true) {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n\\n            if (slow == fast) {\\n                break;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        int slow2 = nums[0];\\n\\n        while (slow != slow2) {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            slow2 = nums[slow2];\\n        }\\n\\n        return slow;        \\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nThank you for reading. \\u2B50\\uFE0FIf you like the article, don\\'t forget to upvote it and subscribe to my youtube channel!\\n\\nMy next post for daily coding challenge on Sep 20, 2023\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-x-to-zero/solutions/4066549/how-we-think-about-a-solution-on-time-o1-space-python-javascript-java-c/\\n\\nHave a nice day!",

                "content": "I ask this problem in interviews as it has so many approaches (but with the repeated number appearing exacctly twice). I usually give 5 to 15 minutes to the candidate to solve this problem, trying to get the candidate to a O(n) time O(1) space not modifying the input solution. \\n\\nNOTE: I removed the sum based solution as it works when duplicate number appears only twice, which is not exactly the constraints of this problem.\\n\\n**Summary solutions that I found:**\\n- With extra space - O(n) time, O(n) space\\n\\t- using an additional vector \\n\\t- using an unordered_set \\n- Without extra space, modifying the input - O(1) space\\n\\t- marking visted value - O(n) time\\n\\t- sorting input array - O(n log(n)) time\\n\\t- index sort - O(n) time\\n- Without extra space, non modifying the input - O(1) space\\n    - brute force - O(n^2)\\n\\t- cycle detection - O(n) time\\n\\n\\n**Solution 1 : Using an additional vector - O(n) time, O(n) space**\\n\\nThat is generally the approach that comes to mind immediately, it does not fully take advantage of the problem.\\n\\n```cpp\\nint findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\tvector<int> seen(nums.size()+1);\\n\\tfor(auto n: nums){\\n\\t\\tif(seen[n]) \\n\\t\\t\\treturn n;\\n\\t\\tseen[n] = true;\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn 0; // return whatever here\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Note 1:** Some could suggest to use `vector<bool>` to consume less memory. True, but to do that, `vector<bool>` is a specialized implementation of `vector` that comes with weird issues (returned element is a proxy, not a reference to a bool) and is quite slow.\\n\\n**Note 2:** Some extra effort could be made on this solution to have a single return statement. \\n\\n\\n**Solution 2 : Using an unordered_set - O(n) time, O(n) space**\\n\\nMore or less the same as solution 1.\\n\\n```cpp\\nint findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\tunordered_set<int> seen(nums.size()+1);\\n\\tfor(auto n: nums){\\n\\t\\tif(seen.count(n)) \\n\\t\\t\\treturn n;\\n\\t\\tseen.insert(n);\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn 0; // return whatever here\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n**Solution 3: Marking visited value within the array - O(n) time, O(1) space**\\n\\nThis approach is similar to solution 1, but a bit more clever: the idea here is to encode the fact that a value has been seen within the input array. \\nIt relies on the observation that the values within the array fit the indexing space, all values are in between `[1..n]` and the array size is `n+1`. \\nA simple way to encode this information is to flip the sign of `nums[n]` to indicate that value `n` has been observed. It works beccause it\\'s guaranteed that there is no negative value in the input.\\n\\n```cpp\\nint findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\tfor(auto n: nums) {\\n\\t\\tint idx = abs(n);\\n\\t\\tif(nums[idx] < 0)\\n\\t\\t\\treturn idx;\\n\\t\\tnums[idx] = -nums[idx];\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n**Solution 4: Sorting the array then finding adjacent duplicate - O(n log(n)) time, O(1) space**\\n\\nThis is very natural approach to solve the problem, however it has some complexity penalty and it does not take advantage of the constraints of the problem. It\\'s implementation in C++  is quite elegant in just 2 lines (when using STL):\\n\\n```cpp\\nint findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\tsort(nums.begin(), nums.end());\\n\\treturn *adjacent_find(nums.cbegin(), nums.cend());\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n**Solution 5: Index sort - O(n) time, O(1) space**\\n\\nGenerally after 5 minutes looking at the problem, we notice that once sorted, each value `v` is stored at index `v-1` (i.e. 1 is at index 0, 5 at index 4, etc..). Therefore we can sort the input array in linear time:\\n- The algorithm starts at index `0` and finishes at index `n`\\n- if the value is already sorted (`nums[i] == i+1`), then skip to the next value\\n- else, check if there is alreay the same value at the correct index (`nums[i] == nums[nums[i]-1]`):\\n\\t- if there is one, that\\'s our duplicate\\n\\t- else exchange the value with the one at it\\'s place\\n\\n```cpp\\nint findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\tfor(int i = 0; i < nums.size();) {\\n\\t\\tif(nums[i] == i+1)\\n\\t\\t\\t++i;\\n\\t\\telse if(int &n = nums[i]; nums[n-1] == n)\\n\\t\\t\\treturn n;\\n\\t\\telse\\n\\t\\t\\tswap(n, nums[n-1]);\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n**Solutions not modifying the input and without extra space**\\n\\n\\n**Solution 6: Brute force - O(n^2) time, O(1) space - TLE**\\n\\nSurprisingly (or not), this is not the approach that comes first to the mind to candidates (they suggest it when I ask to solve the problem in O(1) space and without modifying the input array). However I consider it fine as a starter solution during an interview.\\n\\n```cpp\\nint findDuplicate(const vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\tfor(int i=0; i < nums.size()-1; ++i)\\n\\t\\tfor(int j=i+1; j < nums.size(); ++j)\\n\\t\\t\\tif(nums[i] == nums[j])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn nums[i];\\n\\treturn 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Solution 7: Cycle detection using slow fast pointers - O(n) time, O(1) space**\\n\\nThe idea here is to apply the slow fast pointer approach to find a cycle in a linked list.\\nSince the values space `[1..n]` fits the index space `[0..n]`, the input array can represent an underlying linked list where the next element of `nums[i]` is `nums[nums[i]]`.\\nThe existence of a duplicate in the array will therefore create a cycle in the underlying linked list as 2 nodes of the linked list will point to the same next element.\\nSo now, the problem is the same as [142.

                "content": "There is a better solution in O(N) time with cycle detection, but it is very hard to come up with unless you know it IMO.\\n\\nFirst of all, why binary search? We know that the complexity should be less than O(N^2), which leaves us O(N) and O(N * logN). We can discard O(logN) since we need to check all elements at least once.\\nSince we cannot modify the input array and we cannot use extra space, we can discard:\\n1. Sorting. It\\'s O(N * logN), but requires either extra space or modifying the array.\\n2. Any kind of recursion. In languages with no tail recursion, recursion takes additional non-constant space.\\n3. Dynamic Programming (most likely). Usually DP takes extra space for storing intermediate results.\\n4. Any kind of additional data structures, like HashTables, Queues, Stacks, Trees, Graphs etc.\\n\\nIf you look at what\\'s left from the basic concepts (even in LeetCode explore section), Binary Search is the only thing that\\'s left. Frankly speaking, following that logic, LinkedList would also be discarded, which would make you miss the cycle detection solution. But the trick here is to figure out that array in this case can be used as a LinkedList, that\\'s why I think it\\'s not reasonable to expect somebody to come up with this solution during an interview.\\n\\nOK, so we will try to come up with binary search solution. How can we do that?\\n\\nWe know that the answer lies between 1 and N. If we can come up with an idea of how to discard half of the interval at each step, we will get log N part of the target complexity of O(N * logN). Keep in mind that here we do not apply binary search to the array itself as it is usually done, we apply BS to the interval of possible solutions. So in each iteration we do not \"shrink\" the array in any way, we \"shrink\" the possible answer space.\\nUsually when you search element in the array, the array is your \"answer space\". You go either to the left of \\'mid\\' element or to the right when searching for target. Here the array serves only as a data structure for the \\'check\\' condition in binary search.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that this observation leaves us O(N) time complexity for each step of the binary search (each check of the \"mid\" element), which allows us to fully traverse the array.\\n\\nHow can we shrink the interval of answer space between 1..N in half?\\n\\nIn each iteration of binary search, we need to answer two questions:\\n1. Is mid the duplicate element we look for?\\n2. Is answer in the interval [l, mid)? l here stands for the left bound of our current answer space.\\n\\nIf we know answers to these questions, we can either immediately return the mid if the answer to question #1 is yes, or to go either to the left if the answer to question 2 is yes, or to go right if the answer is no.\\n\\nHow can we answer question #2? We can iterate through the entire array and count number of elements that lie in interval [l, mid]. If the count is greater than mid - l +1, than the answer is yes, otherwise no. Why is that? Let\\'s look at some examples.\\nLet\\'s say our interval is [3,4], where 3 is l (left) and 4 is mid, and the interval is between[3,5]. Let\\'s look at various possible values of \\'count\\', where \\'count\\' is number of elements between 3 and 4 inclusive (i.e., elements is either 3 or 4).\\ncount = 1:\\nwe encountered only one element, which was either 3 or 4.\\ncount = 2:\\nwe encountered two elements, which were either 3,3 or 3,4 or 4,4. If it was 4,4, we would return it since it is mid element. If it is 3,4, then obviously we don\\'t have our answer between 3 and 4, since count(3) == 1 and count(4) == 1 in the entire array.\\nWhat about 3,3? Is it a valid input? No, since we\\'re looking at the left side of the array where numbers could be only from 1..n.\\nIn other words, if the following input *would have been* correct, then our algorithm wouldn\\'t work:\\n[1,2,3,3,5,6,7,8] \\nNotice that 4 is missing, but 8 is here which contradicts the requirements. The only possible \"slot\" left for the number instead of 8 is either another 3 or 4, because if it is let\\'s say 5, we would have 2 duplicates.\\nExamples of correct inputs:\\n[1,2,3,3,5,6,7,4]\\n[1,2,3,3,5,6,7,3]\\n[1,2,3,3,5,6,3,3]\\nWhich leads us to the next case.\\ncount > 2:\\n3,3,4\\n3,3,3\\n3,3,3,3 \\netc., so we need to look between [3,4] in the next step of our binary search.\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public int FindDuplicate(int[] nums) {\\n        int l = 1, r = nums.Length - 1; // 1..n, initial answer space\\n        \\n        while (l <= r) // binary search, template 1 from leetcode explore\\n        {\\n            int eq = 0, inRange = 0;\\n            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;\\n            \\n            for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)\\n            {\\n                if (nums[i] == mid)\\n                {\\n                    eq++; // need to check if mid is the answer\\n                    inRange++; // anyways, cound mid elements as in range to answer question #2\\n                }\\n                else if (nums[i] < mid && nums[i] >= l)\\n                {\\n                    inRange++;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            if (eq > 1)\\n                return mid;\\n            else if (inRange > mid - l+1)\\n                r = mid - 1; // go left\\n            else\\n                l = mid + 1; // go right\\n        }\\n        \\n        return -1; // not reachable according to problem statement\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Considering the constraints we do it using **Floyd\\'s Cycle Detection Algorithm**. In this we consider two pointers slow and fast(both are initialised to starting of list),where slow moves by one step at a time,fast moves by 2 steps at a time. i.e (in terms of Linked lists) slow=slow->next and fast=fast->next->next .As i have mentioned earlier the address values can be considered as array values here i.e slow=nums[slow]; and fast=nums[nums[fast]]; And in question its mentioned that n+1 array having 1 to n values that means atleast one number will be repeating for sure(*Pigeon Hole Principle*) .i.e in our terms *there is an address that repeats for sure* and our task is to find it.  so by moving slow,fast values in above way they both will become equal for sure after some steps(since there\\'s a cycle).\\n2.  **Finding the Start of the loop**\\n    Now lets consider the loop starts at **s** distance from the starting of array. and x be the point where slow,fast met(**meeting position**). let rs,rf represent no.of rotations made by slow,fast pointers before meeting and let *l*  be the length of the loop.\\n\\t*Then Distance Travelled by slow pointer* = s+rs\\\\**l*+x and by Fast Pointer = s+rf \\\\**l*+x\\n\\tand we know that **since slow moves by one step and fast moves by 2 steps..the Distance travelled by fast =2(Distance travelled by slow)**.\\n\\t->s+rf \\\\**l*+x=2\\\\*(s+rs\\\\**l*+x)\\n\\t->(rf-2\\\\*rs)\\\\**l*=s+x\\n\\ti.e **s+x is the multiple of the length of the loop**.\\n\\t*Now as our pointers have already moved by x from the start of loop,moving by s will make the pointer move to the start of the loop. and we do that by making one pointer start from the starting point of array and the other at meeting position both moving one step at the time..there by making them meet at the start of the loop and that value is our required answer.. cheers!!* \\n\\t \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/8320fa90-f7c4-429d-ab44-bd623c28546c_1593083741.1838455.png)\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s the Code for above Explanation\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n       int slow = nums[0];\\n       int fast = nums[0];\\n\\t  //Detecting the loop.\\n       do{\\n           slow = nums[slow];\\n           fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n       }while(slow != fast);\\n\\t\\t// Finding Start positon of the loop.\\n        slow = nums[0];\\n        while(slow != fast){\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[fast];\\n        }\\n\\n        return fast;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

I was not able to solve this problem in O(1) space and solving it in O(1) space complexity, O(n) time and without modifying original array makes it a really hard problem.\\n\\nI did find this interesting  article - https://keithschwarz.com/interesting/code/?dir=find-duplicate\\n\\nIt explains the way using which we can solve this problem in O(1) space, O(n) time and without modifying the array. We have to think of the array like a linked list and then think - How can we find repeated nodes in a linked list? or in other words - How to detect a cycle in a linked list?\\n\\nWell, we know that we can do that using two pointers - slow and fast. \\n\\nLets take an example : nums  = [1,3,4,2,2]\\n\\nLets create a linked list from it (We won\\'t do that in code, obviously).\\n\\n\\t\\t1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 2\\n\\t   slow\\n\\t   fast\\n\\t\\t\\nSo, initially, we have slow and fast pointers both pointing to the first node. \\n\\nAnd now, we will increment fast by two nodes and slow by one node. But, in case of linked lists, we have next pointers that point to the next nodes. Here in the array, we do not have any such info so we cannot simply increment slow and fast. \\n\\nWe have to increment them by taking the values as the pointer/indexes to the next node. \\n\\ne.g. at slow pointer, currently value is 1\\nSo to increment it by one node, we will use this value as the index of new slow pointer node. i.e., \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslow = nums[slow]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nAnd similarly, to increment fast by two, we will do somethind similar to fast.next.next:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t  fast = nums[nums[fast]]\\n\\t\\t\\t  \\nWe will do this until slow and fast are pointing to same node.\\n\\nSo, in first iteration. slow = 1 so new slow = nums[1] => 3\\n Similarly, fast = 1 so new fast = nums[nums[1]] => nums[3] => 2\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 2\\n\\t        slow\\n\\t                  fast\\n\\t\\nAgain, new slow = nums[3] = 2\\n\\t\\t  new fast = nums[nums[2]] = nums[4] = 2\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 2\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  slow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   fast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\nHere, we see that slow = fast as both are 2. So we break.\\n\\nAnd now, we have to do the second step which is to find the beginning of cycle in linked list. So, we reset slow pointer to again point to first element.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tslow = nums[0] = 1\\n\\t\\t\\nAnd now, we will increment slow and fast, both by one until they become same.\\n\\t\\nnew slow = nums[slow] = nums[1] = 3\\nnew fast = nums[nums[fast]] = nums[nums[2]] = nums[4] = 2\\n\\n\\t\\t1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 2\\n\\t        slow\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   fast\\n\\nnew slow = nums[slow] = nums[3] = 2\\nnew fast = nums[nums[fast]] = nums[nums[2]] = nums[4] = 2\\n\\nAnd here, slow = fast.\\n\\nSo finally, we will return any one of these two values and that is our required repeated number in the array.\\n\\n\\nHere is the code in Python - \\n\\n```\\ndef findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        \\n        #Use the same approach here as in detecting the beginning of cycle in a linked list\\n        \\n        #Initially, both slow and fast point to the first element of the array\\n        slow = nums[0]\\n        fast = nums[0]\\n        \\n        #Now, we will increment slow by one and fast by two steps\\n        # DO Note that in case of a linked list, we do slow.next and slow.next.next as we use the next pointer ofa node\\n        # But here, since all we have at each position is a number, we will increment by using that number as the next pointer/index\\n        while(True):\\n            slow = nums[slow]\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]]\\n            if(slow == fast): break\\n        \\n        \\n        #Now, once we detect the cycle, now its time to find the starting point of it. \\n        #Just like in a linked list, we will reset our slow pointer to again point to first element\\n        \\n        slow  = nums[0]\\n        \\n        #And now, we increment both pointers one step at a time until they point to the same element. \\n        # The element they will eventually point to is the repeated element\\n        while(slow != fast):\\n            slow = nums[slow]\\n            fast = nums[fast]\\n        \\n        \\n        return slow\\n```\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n",

What we\\'ll do is- we\\'ll store all the values one by one if it hasn\\'t been inserted before in the set, and if we see the value already exist there, we can return that value.\\n\\n**TC:** O(N), as we are traversing the elements only once\\n**SC:** O(N), as in the worst case we may have to store (N-1) values in the set\\n\\n**CODE:**\\n   ```\\n int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums){\\n        unordered_set<int> s;\\n        \\n        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){\\n            if(s.find(nums[i])!=s.end()){\\n                return nums[i];\\n            }\\n            s.insert(nums[i]);\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    } \\n```\\n    \\n    \\n**APPROACH-3: USING FLOYD\\'S LOOP DETECTION TECHNIQUE**\\nThe idea is pretty simple. As we are assured that there will be only one duplicate value, so if we create a virtual Linked List here (see, how we did that->Dry run if you don\\'t get the idea), and apply the Floyd\\'s Loop Detection technique here, then we gonna surely face a collision somewhere, and that tells us- yes, we have a duplicate value here. But, in order to find out which value is the duplicate one- we have to set a pointer to the 0-th element and we\\'ll move both the pointers at a same speed (one step at a time). Whenever we\\'ll see the \\'slow\\' and \\'fast\\' are having equal values that will be the duplicate value.\\n\\n**NOTE:** *If you didn\\'t get the idea make sure you know **Floyd\\'s Loop Detection Algorithm** (in Linked List), and also **dry run** the below code.*\\n\\n**TC:** almost O(N), because it may require us to have more than N opertaions to find out the collision\\n**SC:** O(1), as there\\'s no scaling DS used\\n\\n**CODE:**\\n```\\n    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums){\\n        int slow=nums[0], fast=nums[0];\\n        \\n        //NOTE: We are using do-while loop here, because at the very first step \\'fast==slow\\'. you can use normal while loop also, but for that you have to add additional conditions also.\\n        do{\\n            slow=nums[slow];  //one step at a time\\n            fast=nums[nums[fast]];  //two steps at a time\\n        }while(slow!=fast);\\n        \\n        //We have met our first collision, now we have to find out the value for which the collision happened\\n        slow=nums[0];   //re-initializing the slow pointer with the 0-th value \\n        while(slow!=fast){\\n            slow=nums[slow];  //one step at a time\\n            fast=nums[fast];  //one step at a time\\n        }\\n        return fast;  //return slow will also work\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n\\n*Hope it helps!\\nThank You:)*\\n",

In every case `nums_sum` would be duplicated number more. To get duplicate number `nums_sum - n_sum` would give `2` which is correct.\\n\\nVisualization:  \\n```\\nnums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]\\nn = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # 1 + 2 + 3 + ... n = n*n+1/2\\n```\\nCancel all common terms, you will be left with the duplicated number.",

It does this by using a HashMap data structure to store the frequency of each element in the array.\\n\\nThe solution iterates over the array and for each element, it increases the frequency count in the HashMap by 1. If the frequency count for a particular element becomes 2, it means that this element has already been encountered once and is therefore a duplicate. The function returns this duplicate element as the answer.\\n\\nIf there are no duplicates in the array, the function will return -1, which is a default value indicating that no duplicate was found.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the solution only needs to go through the array once, and each operation of updating the frequency count in the HashMap takes O(1) time on average.\\n\\n\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity of this solution is also O(n), as the HashMap needs to store the frequency count of all elements in the array. In the worst case, where all elements are different, the HashMap will need to store n key-value pairs, which takes O(n) space.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {\\n        HashMap<Integer,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\\n        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){\\n            map.put(nums[i],map.getOrDefault(nums[i],0)+1);\\n            if(map.get(nums[i])==2){\\n                return nums[i];\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n![upvote.jpeg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/194ca6ec-0c74-45e7-abf1-7acfa6005dbb_1675942668.3920887.jpeg)\\n",

Initially slow will initialize with the first element and fast will initialize with the element present in ***nums[0]*** index.\\n- In the first loop, we\\u2019ll move both pointers with 1 index & break after slow=fast.\\n- Then we\\u2019ll make fast 0 & in the next loop we\\u2019ll move the slow pointer with 1 position and fast with 2 positions.\\n- One point the both will equal and return fast/slow.\\n- **Time complexity:** O(n).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Code:\\n\\n```cpp\\n//Solution 01:\\n**class Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n=nums.size();\\n        vector<int> temp(n+1, 0);\\n        \\n        for(auto x:nums){\\n            temp[x]++;\\n            if(temp[x] >1)\\n                return x;\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};**\\n\\n//Solution 02:\\n**class Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums)\\n    {    \\n        if (nums.size() > 1)\\n        {\\n            int slow = nums[0];\\n            int fast = nums[nums[0]];\\n            while (slow != fast)\\n            {\\n                slow = nums[slow];\\n                fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n            }\\n\\n            fast = 0;\\n            while (fast != slow)\\n            {\\n                fast = nums[fast];\\n                slow = nums[slow];\\n            }\\n            return slow;\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};**\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n> **Please upvote this solution**\\n>",

People who ignore requirements in an inteview will not look good to the interviewer.\\n\\nHere\\'s the first two rules from the problem description:\\n```\\nYou must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).\\nYou must use only constant, O(1) extra space.\\n```\\n\\nMany posts claim the problem is easy to solve with a fast solution - often ignoring the O(1) restriction.  Code that performs one insert per input is using O(n) space.  Doesn\\'t even matter if it puts all or most of them into a set or dictionary, it\\'s using O(n) space.\\n\\nBut modifying the array, by assinging things to ```nums``` or calling ```nums.sort()``` also violates the problem description.  Here\\'s some sample solutions that violate these two requirements:\\n\\n32 ms: ```distinct = set()``` followed later by ```distinct.add(num)```\\n44 ms: ```nums.sort()```\\n56 ms: ```nums[abs(nums[i])] = - nums[abs(nums[i])]```\\n60 ms: ```nums.sort()```\\n\\nAs you browse the topics for this problem, just keep in mind most of them violate the problem description.

                "content": "According to the [solution article](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/solution/), we are already knowing that we can use Floyd\\'s cycle detection algorithm.\\n\\n# Why Using Cycle Detection\\n\\nAccording to the description of this problem, we knowing that the value of the elements might between `1` to `count`.\\n\\nSo the hint tells as we might be ok to see this array as a kind of flow. Base on this, we also can say the value of an elements is represent the next index we can go.\\n\\nFor example, if we have a given array `[1, 3, 4, 2, 3]`\\n\\n``` text\\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\\n| [0] | [1] | [2] | [3] | [4] |\\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\\n|  1  |  3  |  4  |  2  |  3  |\\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\\n```\\n\\nWe started from `[0]`, we found that we start from `1`, then we got `3` at `[1]`, `2` at `[3]` and so on.\\n\\nAnd let\\'s trying to redraw this array into a simple flow. (I am not sure we can call it a state machine or not lol)\\n\\n``` text\\n\\n+---+    +---+    +---+    +---+\\n| 1 | -> | 3 | -> | 2 | -> | 4 |\\n+---+    +---+    +---+    +---+\\n           ^                 |\\n           |                 |\\n           +-----------------+\\n```\\n\\nThen we got a flow has a cycle. And that\\'s the reason why we can use Floyd to solve this problem.\\n\\n## Steps\\n\\nWe can devide this problem into 2 main parts base on Floyd\\'s algorithm.\\n\\n1. Prove the array (or flow) has a cycle, and get the intersection index of slow and fast from it.\\n2. Get the entrance of this cycle by using the intersection index then return the target index.\\n\\nPlease check [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd\\'s_Tortoise_and_Hare) for the detail of Floyd\\'s algorithm.\\n\\n### Traversal (\"1 Step\")\\n\\nSince we have already treat the value of an element as the destination index, our way of traversal will become like this\\n\\n``` swift\\nvar slow = nums[slow]\\n```\\n\\n### Slow-Fast Pointer at Part 1.\\n\\n``` swift\\nslow = nums[slow]           // Take 1 step\\nfast = nums[nums[fast]]     // Take 2 steps\\n```\\n\\nBase on Floyd\\'s algorithm\\'s theory, if there is a loop inside a list, slow and fast pointers will meet on the loop. And that\\'s the reason why we took the `meet` as the way of determine whether a list has a loop or not.\\n\\n## Code\\n\\nBase on the explanation above, we can have a piece of code liked below.\\n\\n``` swift\\nclass Solution {\\n    // Main method\\n    func findDuplicate(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {\\n        let intersectionIndex = findIntersectionIndex(nums)\\n        return findStartIndex(nums, intersectionIndex)\\n    }\\n    \\n    private func findIntersectionIndex(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {\\n        var slow = nums[0]\\n        var fast = nums[0]\\n        \\n        repeat {\\n            slow = nums[slow]\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]]\\n        } while slow != fast\\n        \\n        return slow\\n    }\\n    \\n    private func findStartIndex(_ nums: [Int], _ intersection: Int) -> Int {\\n        var slow = nums[0]\\n        var fast = intersection\\n        \\n        while slow != fast {\\n            slow = nums[slow]\\n            fast = nums[fast]\\n        }\\n        \\n        return slow\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

                "content": "# **Find the cycle solution. O(n) time O(1) space**\\nThe problem is simple once you know the trick. Check out [finding cycle in linked list](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/discuss/151434/2-c++-solutions.-Beat-100.-With-comments-proof-and-description.) for background as to how this finds the start of a cycle.\\n\\nBasically we treat the array elements as an index to another element, this produces a kind of linked list starting at the first element. As each element is in the range [1, n] and there are n + 1 elements, each element will point to a valid index. A cycle will be created when two (or more) duplicates point to the same element. All that remains is to find the start of the cycle.\\n\\n## **C++ Solution**\\n```\\nint findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n  int slow = 0;\\n  int fast = 0;\\n  while ((slow = nums[slow]) != (fast = nums[nums[fast]]))\\n    ;\\n  slow = 0;\\n  while ((slow = nums[slow]) != (fast = nums[fast]))\\n    ;\\n  return slow;\\n}\\n```\\nI mean, I know it could get stupid a really ugly compact.\\n```\\n  int fast = nums[nums[0]];\\n  for (int slow = nums[0]; slow != fast; slow = nums[slow], fast = nums[nums[fast]]) ;\\n  for (int slow = 0; slow != fast; slow = nums[slow], fast = nums[fast]) ;\\n  return fast;\\n}\\n```\\t\\t\\nBut that\\'s just dumb.\\n## **C Solution**\\nPretty much exactly the same as c++\\n```c\\nint findDuplicate(int* nums, int numsSize){\\n  int slow = 0;\\n  int fast = 0;\\n  while ((slow = nums[slow]) != (fast = nums[nums[fast]])) /* Move slow one step, fast two */\\n    ;\\n  slow = 0;\\n  while ((slow = nums[slow]) != (fast = nums[fast])) /* Move both one step until they meet now */\\n    ;\\n  return slow;\\n}\\n```\\n## **Java Solution**\\nPretty much exactly the same as c++\\n```java\\npublic int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {\\n  int slow = 0;\\n  int fast = 0;\\n  while ((slow = nums[slow]) != (fast = nums[nums[fast]]))\\n    ;\\n  slow = 0;\\n  while ((slow = nums[slow]) != (fast = nums[fast]))\\n    ;\\n  return slow;\\n}\\n```\\n## **Python Solution**\\nYou can\\'t update the indexes as part of the while loop, so the python solution is slightly longer (though you could update slow and fast on the same line with python.\\n```python\\ndef findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n  slow = nums[0];\\n  fast = nums[nums[0]]\\n  while slow != fast:\\n    slow = nums[slow]\\n    fast = nums[nums[fast]]\\n  slow = 0\\n  while slow != fast:\\n    slow = nums[slow]\\n    fast = nums[fast]\\n  return slow\\n  ```\\n\\n# **Partition search. O(nlogn) time O(1) space**\\nAn alternative solution is to brute force it, guessing possible values and checking if it is the duplicate. How to check though? One way is to use a simple flag, setting it on the first occurance of the target number and returning if the target is seen again. That only gives a true or false indication, can we do better?\\n\\nIf you consider the case of no duplicates, if we are targeting a number `n`, then we would expect there to be `n` numbers equal or below `n`. What about if there is a duplicate? Well if the duplicate is `n` or below, then our count would be over. If the count is equal or less, then the duplicate must be _above_ `n`. That sounds like something we can search on.\\n\\n```\\nint findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n  int lo = 0;\\n  int hi = nums.size() - 1;\\n  int mid;\\n  while (lo < hi) {\\n    mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;\\n    // Count how many numbers are equal or below the mid, if it is lower than expected then the\\n    // duplicate must be in the upper partition, other wise it\\'s in the lower partition.\\n    if (mid >= std::count_if(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [&mid] (int n) { return n <= mid; })) {\\n      lo = mid + 1;\\n    } else {\\n      hi = mid;\\n    }\\n  }\\n  return hi;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n",

Therefor, the current value of `m` must be the repeated value `v`.\\n\\nIn code:\\n\\n    class Solution(object):\\n        def findDuplicate(self, nums):\\n            \"\"\"\\n            :type nums: List[int]\\n            :rtype: int\\n            \"\"\"\\n            l, h, m = 0, len(nums) - 1, len(nums) >> 1\\n            while h - l > 1:\\n                if sum(1 for i in nums if i <= m) > m:\\n                    h = m\\n                else:\\n                    l = m\\n                m = (h + l + 1) >> 1\\n            return m\\n\\nThis ran in 64ms, has time complexity O(n*log2(n)) and space complexity O(1) (I'm not nitpicking about Python versions; I assume the comprehension in `sum` to be a generator). I saw the cycle detection solution as [posted earlier][1], which is faster and really very elegant. But if it took Knuth 24 hours to come up with a O(n) solution, I'm not feeling bad about coming up with this O(nlogn) cutie :-)\\n\\n\\n  [1]: http://keithschwarz.com/interesting/code/?dir=find-duplicate",

These two pointers will be used to traverse the vector nums.\\n\\n- Use a do-while loop to perform the following steps until slow and fast pointers meet:\\n\\n- Update the slow pointer by moving it to the element at the index nums[slow] in the nums vector.\\n- Update the fast pointer by moving it to the element at the index nums[nums[fast]] in the nums vector. The fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer.\\n- This loop continues until the slow and fast pointers meet at the same element within the array. This meeting point is within the cycle of duplicates in the array.\\n\\n- After the slow and fast pointers have met, reset the slow pointer to the beginning (0 index) of the array while keeping the fast pointer at the meeting point.\\n\\n- Use a while loop to traverse the array again with both slow and fast pointers. Increment both pointers one step at a time in each iteration.\\n\\n- The while loop continues until slow and fast meet again. The point where they meet is the duplicate element in the nums vector.\\n\\n- Return the value pointed to by slow as the duplicate element.\\n\\nThe idea behind this algorithm is to detect a cycle in the array. The slow and fast pointers move within the array, and since there is a duplicate element, they will eventually meet at some point within the cycle. The second traversal ensures that the duplicate element is found.\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:**0(N)**\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:**0(1)**\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n![upvote.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/082ac6f6-d9db-406f-921e-8af2e085d1ec_1695096028.791172.png)\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int slow = 0;\\n        int fast = 0;\\n        do\\n        {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n        }while(slow != fast);\\n        // in this place they have met so now slow will point oward oth index and traverse along long ,and where tehy meet that is duplicate\\n        slow =0;\\n        while(slow != fast)\\n        {\\n            slow = nums[slow];\\n            fast = nums[fast];\\n        }\\n        return slow;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

We\\'ll use that trail of bits to construct our answer, bit by bit.\\n\\n# Examples\\nFor simplicity we\\'ll follow an example with `nums` in order, but that is not necessary.\\n```\\nnums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,8]\\n\\nnums          [1,8]\\nin            in\\nbinary:       binary:\\n0001          0000\\n0010          0001\\n0011          0010\\n0100          0011\\n0101          0100\\n0110          0101\\n0110          0110\\n0111          0111\\n1000          1000\\n____          ____\\n1554          1444   ->  difference:   0110 = 6\\n```\\nWe can see that when we count the bits in each position for all the numbers in `nums` and the bits for all the numbers in `[1,8]` the extra bits are precisely those of the number `6`, the repeated number.\\n\\nNote this still works fine **even if the duplicate appears more than two times**:\\n```\\nnums = [1,2,6,6,6,6,6,7,8]\\n\\nnums          [1,8]\\nin            in\\nbinary:       binary:\\n0001          0000\\n0010          0001\\n0110          0010\\n0110          0011\\n0110          0100\\n0110          0101\\n0110          0110\\n0111          0111\\n1000          1000\\n____          ____\\n1672          1444   ->  difference:   023(-2) ~~> 6\\n```\\n\\nWe can see that the positions where the counts are over `0` are precisely the positions where the duplicate, `6`, has `1`s in its binary expansion. A positive difference means we had extra bits in that position, thus giving us a clue of what the repeated number was.\\n\\n# The algorithm\\nFor each possible bit used in the numbers in *[1,n]* we will count how many of the numbers in `nums` use that bit, and compare that with the count we would get looking only at the numbers from in *[1,n]* **only once**.

You will need to spend time understanding this algorithms because at first it will seem like magic. I won\\'t go into the depth here but you can read [this](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/10360/floyds-cycle-detection-algorithm-determining-the-starting-point-of-cycle) page which gives a short explanation as to why it works. For a more in-depth explanation, read [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection).\\n\\n```cpp\\nint findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\tint slow, fast;\\n\\tslow = fast = 0;\\n\\t\\n\\t// floyd\\'s algorithm\\n\\tdo {\\n\\t\\tslow = nums[slow];\\n\\t\\tfast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n\\t} while (slow != fast);\\n\\n\\t// find the entrance to the cyle\\n\\tslow = 0;\\n\\twhile (slow != fast) {\\n\\t\\tslow = nums[slow];\\n\\t\\tfast = nums[fast];\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\treturn slow;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Complexity:**\\n* Time: `O(n)`\\n* Space: `O(1)`\\n\\n\\n**Approach 2: Binary Search**\\n\\nWe know the range of the values are form `1` to `n`. We can binary search this range to find the duplicate element. At each step, we compute the `number of values \\u2264 mid`, let\\'s call this `x`. If `x` is greater than `mid`, then we know the range `1` to `mid` contains duplicates. If not, then the range `mid + 1` to `n` contains duplicates.\\n\\nUsing the property, we binary search on either the left side or the right side. Look into the implementation for more details.\\n\\n```cpp\\nint findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\tint mid, low = 1, high = nums.size();\\n\\n\\t// helper function\\n\\tauto good = [&](int x) -> bool {\\n\\t\\tint cnt = 0;\\n\\t\\tfor (int& num: nums)\\n\\t\\t\\tcnt += num <= x;\\n\\t\\treturn cnt > x;\\n\\t};\\n\\n\\t// binary search\\n\\twhile (low < high) {\\n\\t\\tmid = (low + high) / 2;\\n\\t\\tif (good(mid))\\n\\t\\t\\thigh = mid;\\n\\t\\telse\\n\\t\\t\\tlow = mid + 1;\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\treturn high;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Complexity:**\\n* Time: `O(n \\u2022 log n)`\\n* Space: `O(1)`\\n\\n\\n**Bonus: Using the bit information**\\n\\nThis is perhaps the most different approach. Here, we keep track of the bit information in array called `bit`. For each _bit_ position from `0` to `31` (using zero-indexing), we count the number of ones present for each number from `1` to `n`. This array contains the count of ones in each bit position assuming there are no duplicates.\\n\\nNow what happens if there is a duplicate? Let\\'s say the duplicate is `11` or in binary `1011`. Then in each of the bit positions `{0, 1, 3}` there is an additional one.\\n\\nFrom this, we get the following: count the number of ones in each _bit_ position from `0` to `31` for each number in nums. If the value of ones is greater than the actual count stored in `bit[i]`, then add one to the position `i`.\\n\\n```cpp\\nint findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\tint dup = 0;\\n\\tvector<int> bit(32);\\n\\tint n = nums.size() - 1;\\n\\n\\t// precompute\\n\\tfor (int b = 0; b < 32; b++)\\n\\t\\tfor (int x = 1; x <= n; x++)\\n\\t\\t\\tbit[b] += (x >> b) & 1;\\n\\t\\n\\t// find the duplicate\\n\\tfor (int b = 0; b < 32; b++) {\\n\\t\\tint cnt = 0;\\n\\t\\tfor (int& num: nums)\\n\\t\\t\\tcnt += (num >> b) & 1;\\n\\t\\tdup |= (cnt > bit[b]) << b;\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\treturn dup;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Complexity:**\\n* Time: `O(n \\u2022 32) = O(n)`\\n* Space: `O(32) = O(1)`\\n\\nPlease feel free to ask any questions you may have.

Here is my note:\\n\\nFirst, we could transfer the problem into a linked list one, as it says\\n\\n> Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive)\\n\\n![0_1480513558264_upload-5ab3fbe9-fe5a-4fed-87d9-c8a6dc51a945](/uploads/files/1480513561443-upload-5ab3fbe9-fe5a-4fed-87d9-c8a6dc51a945.png)\\n\\nThen I learnt [Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cycle_detection): Two pointers, `slow` runs 1 step each time and `fast` runs 2, would definitely meet if there is a cycle.\\n\\nWell, they might meet any position in the circle, how would we find the entry point?\\n\\n![0_1480514894297_LeetCode_287_Circle_Detect.2.png](/uploads/files/1480514898071-leetcode_287_circle_detect.2.png) \\n\\nWhat we know\\n\\n1. `fast` has run `a+b+c+b` steps, and `slow` with `a+b` steps\\n2. `fast` runs double steps of `slow`\\n\\nWe could conclude that\\n\\n```\\na+b+c+b = 2*(a+b)\\n# => a == c\\n```\\n\\nIt means, steps between start point to circle entry equals steps between meet point to circle entry. So when we find the meet point, we could set a new pointer at start position, which would meet `slow` at the entry point.\\n\\nCode\\n\\n```ruby\\n  def find_duplicate(nums)\\n    slow, fast = nums[0], nums[ nums[0] ]\\n\\n    # A loop guaranteed\\n    while slow != fast\\n      slow = nums[slow]\\n      fast = nums[ nums[fast] ]\\n    end\\n\\n    # Set a tag at start point.

Sorting is performed to bring duplicate elements together. After sorting, if there are duplicates in the list, they will be adjacent to each other.\\n```\\nnums.sort()\\n```\\n\\n2) **Finding Duplicate by Scanning:** After sorting, the method enters a loop that starts from the second element `index 1` and goes up to the last element `index length - 1`. This is because, in a sorted list, duplicates will be adjacent to each other.\\n```\\nlength = len(nums)\\n```\\n3) **Comparing Adjacent Elements:** Inside the loop, it compares the current element at `index i (nums[i]) with the previous element at index i - 1 (nums[i - 1])`. If these two elements are equal, it means a duplicate has been found, and the method returns the duplicate value immediately.\\n```\\n        for i in range(1, length):\\n            if nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:\\n                return nums[I]\\n```\\n\\n4) **No Duplicate Found:** If the loop completes without finding any adjacent equal elements, it means there are no duplicates in the list. In this case, the method returns the `length` of the sorted list, which is length, as a signal that no duplicates were detected.\\n```\\nreturn length\\n```\\n\\n******Second Approach:****** without modifying the original array\\n[see the successfully accepted Submission](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1053515625/)\\n\\nIt is not allowed to change the list(Thanks for LeetCode community who mentioned it). So let\\'s use another approach such as \"Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare\" (Cycle Detection) algorithm to find the duplicate element in the nums array without modifying it. It finds the element where the cycle (duplicate) starts in a linked-list-like representation of the array.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def findDuplicate(self, nums):\\n        \\n        # 1) We need two pointers.

Any particular index is pointing to the value at that index, like `index -> A[index] -> A[A[index]]` and so on.\\n- For example- given array is `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3]`. In case of duplicate, two indexes will have same value and they will form a cycle just like in the image given below: So we can find the entry point of cycle in the linked-list and that will be our duplicate element.\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/pratik_patil/image_1548273971.png)\\n\\n**Algorithm:**\\n1. We maintain two pointers `fast` and `slow`\\n2. For each step `fast` will move to the index that is equal to` A[A[fast]]` which is two steps at a time and `slow` will move to the index `A[slow]` which is one step at a time. Eventually, `fast` and `slow` will meet in a cycle and the entry point of that circle will be the duplicate element.\\n3. When `fast == slow` that means now we are in a cycle.\\n4. Now we need to find entry point so we will start with `slow = 0` and visit one step at a time for both `fast` and `slow`. When `fast == slow` that will be entry point.\\n5. Return the entry point.\\n\\n**Time complexity:** `O(N)`\\n**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int findDuplicate(int[] A) {\\n        int slow = A[0];\\n        int fast = A[A[0]];\\n\\n        while (slow != fast) {\\n            slow = A[slow];\\n            fast = A[A[fast]];\\n        }\\n        slow = 0;\\n\\n        while (slow != fast) {\\n            slow = A[slow];\\n            fast = A[fast];\\n        }\\n        return slow;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Initialize two pointers, `first` and `second`, and start both of them at the first element of the `nums` array.\\n2. Use a loop to advance `first` by one step and `second` by two steps until they meet. This is the first phase of the algorithm and is used to detect the presence of a cycle in the array.\\n3. Once they meet (indicating the presence of a cycle), reset one of the pointers (e.g., `second`) to the first element of the array while keeping the other pointer (`first`) where it is.\\n4. Use another loop to advance both `first` and `second` by one step at a time until they meet again. This is the second phase of the algorithm and is used to find the entrance point of the cycle, which corresponds to the duplicate element.\\n5. Return the element where they meet as the duplicate element.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$ - The algorithm makes two passes through the array. The first pass detects the cycle, and the second pass finds the entrance point of the cycle.\\n- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$ - The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for the two pointers (`first` and `second`).\\n\\nThis approach efficiently finds the duplicate element in the array with constant space complexity.\\n\\n\\n```python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findDuplicate(self, nums):\\n        first = nums[0]\\n        second = nums[0]\\n        \\n        while True:\\n            first = nums[first]\\n            second = nums[nums[second]]\\n            if first == second:\\n                break\\n        \\n        first = nums[0]\\n        while first != second:\\n            first = nums[first]\\n            second = nums[second]\\n        \\n        return first\\n\\n```\\n\\n```cpp []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int first = nums[0];\\n        int second = nums[0];\\n        do {\\n            first = nums[first];\\n            second = nums[nums[second]];\\n        } while (first != second);\\n        \\n        second = nums[0];\\n        while (first != second) {\\n            first = nums[first];\\n            second = nums[second];\\n        }\\n        \\n        return first; \\n    }\\n};\\n",

Beacuse any one element will surely have it\\'s duplicate so in this case if there is only two elment in the array then simply the answer will be first or last element because both will be same.\\n\\nAfter the above process I sorted the array using begin and end indexes and afterward I used a for loop and checked that if element at ith index is same as i+1 or not .\\n\\nIf it is same then return that element, else iterate to the next index. \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(n) \\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(1)\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        \\n        int n = nums.size();\\n        if(n<0)\\n        {\\n            return -1;\\n        }\\n        if(n<=2)\\n        {\\n            \\n            return nums[0];\\n        }\\n        //sort(nums , nums + n);\\n        sort(nums.begin() , nums.end());\\n        int ans ;\\n        for(int i = 0 ; i<n ; i++)\\n        {\\n            if (nums[i] == nums[i+1])\\n            {\\n                ans = nums[i] ;\\n            }\\n            \\n\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "# **DISCLAIMER**\\nWe want to present a full solution that **satisfies the requirements** of the problem: **not modifying the array** (so no negative marking, no sorting, etc.) and **using at most O(1) extra memory**.\\n```\\n```\\n# **A COUPLE OF FACTS**\\n* **FACT I:** if we want to do binary search on an array, the array **must** be sorted.\\n* **FACT II:** for this problem we can (pretend to \\uD83D\\uDE09) create a sorted *helper* array so we can achieve our goal with binary search **without** modifying `nums` or using more than O(1) extra memory. However this will compromise execution time: **The time complexity of this solution is O(n log(n))**.\\n```\\n```\\n# **THE IDEA**\\nLet\\'s **pretend** for a second that the condition of using at most O(1) extra space is not *required*.\\n\\nGiven the array `nums` consider the array `helper` where `helper[i]` is equal to the number of elements in the array `nums` that are **smaller than** `i`. It is **always** true that `helper[i] <= helper[j]` if `i < j`, so `helper` **is** an array sorted in non-decreasing order (which will be crucial so that we can do binary search on it!!). \\n\\nIf `nums` was (some permutation of) the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1]`, this `helper` array would look like `[0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n - 1]` (same array as `sorted(nums)`!). This is, however, not the case for this problem, as there is one element that is repeated **at least once**.\\n\\nIf, for example, we had `nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 4, 2, 3, 4]` our helper array would be `helper = [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7]`. It is a nice array sorted in non-decreasing order. Notice too that *almost everywhere* it is true that `helper[i + 1] - helper[i] <= 1`.\\n\\nExamining our array `nums` we can see that the repeated number is `4` **and** *the* one jump we can see in `helper` is precisely from `2` to `5`. This should come as no surprise: if we sorted `nums` we would get `[2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. Notice how `helper` and `sorted(nums)` coincide from `5` onwards? This is true since `5` is the **smallest** number that is **larger than the repeated number**. (I\\'ll let you think on that fact, we can discuss further in the comments section if it is not clear why this is always true.) This property can be translated as *\"`5` is the first index for which it\\'s not true that `helper[i] < i`\"*.\\n\\nThis is the **key** into how we\\'ll use `helper` to find our repeated number using binary search: We will be looking for the one jump in `helper`. Once we find where `helper` jumps to, we\\'ll know that the repeated number is equal to `jump - 1`. \\n```\\n```\\n# **HOW TO PROCEED WITHOUT USING MORE THAN CONSTANT EXTRA MEMORY?**\\nNow that we know how we want to make use of `helper`, we will **fake it** so we do not have to take the *extra O(n) space* it would need. \\n\\nConsider the function\\n```\\n        def search(idx: int) -> bool:\\n            count = 0\\n            for i in range(n + 1):\\n                if nums[i] < idx:\\n                    count += 1\\n            return count < idx\\n```\\nThis function will mimic the properties of `helper` we want. Notice that for `0 < i`,  `search(i) == True` if and only if `helper[i] < i`. So, we are looking for the smallest `0 < i` such that `search(i) == False`. Once we find it we\\'ll have that the anwer is `i - 1`.\\n\\n# **LET\\'S BE CAREFUL WITH EDGE CASES**\\nConsider the input `nums = [n, n, ..., n, n]`. We have that  `helper = [0, 0, ..., 0, 0]` (so `search(i)` is **always** `True` for `0 < i`). To remedy this, we will set our initial conditions as\\n```\\n        left = 1\\n        right = n + 1  # it is always true that search(n + 1) == False\\n```\\n\\n# **WE ARE NOW READY TO DO BINARY SEARCH**\\nWe\\'ll keep iterating until it is no longer true that `left < right`.\\n\\nOn each iteration we will:\\n* set `mid = (left + right) // 2`\\n* check `search(mid)` (remember we are looking for the smallest `i` such that `search(i) == False`)\\n\\t* if `True` we\\'ll update `left = mid + 1` (the `i` we are looking for is definitely after `mid`)\\n\\t* if `False` we\\'ll update `right = mid` (the `i` we are looking for might be `mid` or smaller)\\n\\nOnce we are out of the loop, we have that the answer is `left - 1`.\\n\\n**Thanks for coming to my TED talk!!** \\uD83E\\uDD73\\n&#8718;\\n\\n\\n# **THE WHOLE SOLUTION**\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n    \\n        n = len(nums) - 1\\n        \\n        def search(num: int) -> bool:\\n            count = 0\\n            for i in range(n + 1):\\n                if nums[i] < num:\\n                    count += 1\\n            return count < num\\n        \\n        left = 1\\n        right = n + 1\\n        \\n        while left < right:\\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\\n            if search(mid):\\n                left = mid + 1\\n            else:\\n                right = mid\\n        \\n        return left - 1\\n```\\n# **COMMENTS**\\nThe `search` function requires O(n) time, so **this solution runs in O(n log(n)) time.**",

I am writing this post as an attempt to explain the solution much clearer, hopefully it can help some people.\\n\\nLet\\'s begin:\\n\\nThe question is saying that we have `n+1` slots, which will be filled by numbers from `1 to n`. As a more concrete example, let\\'s suppose `n=4`, we will have 5 slots and the numbers will be `1,2,3,4` with one of them being the duplicate.\\n\\nLet\\'s suppose the duplicated number is `2`, we will get an array like in **Example 1**\\n```\\nnums = [1,3,4,2,2]\\n```\\nLet\\'s sort the array first to make thing clearer.\\n```\\nnums = [1,2,2,3,4]\\n```\\nFor each `num` in `nums`, if we try to find the the count of all numbers that are `<=num`, we will get the following results.\\n```\\nnums = [1,2,2,3,4]\\ncount:  1 3 3 4 5\\n// some other example\\nnums2 = [1,2,2,2,4]\\ncount:   1 4 4 4 5\\nnums3 = [1,2,3,3,3]\\ncount:   1 2 5 5 5\\n```\\nThe number `nums[2]` has `nums[0] nums[1] nums[2]` as the  number smaller or equal than itself, so the count is `3`.\\nThe pattern is that *when the preceding number is duplicated, the following count will be greater than itself.*\\n\\nBut without sorting, how do we apply binary search?\\n\\nAnswer is: the index of an array is always sorted, we can use the index to represent each number in the array. Maybe the number does not exist in the array, but binary search will close the search space to only 1 number(index), such that to the left of this number(index-1), the count is lower or equal.\\n\\nBack to our unsorted example\\n```\\nnums = [1,3,4,2,2]\\ncount:  1 4 5 3 3\\n```\\nThe first number we are testing is `2`, which is the mid index. Notice the `nums[2]` is `4`, but we do not care. \\n\\n`count=3` which is greater than `2`, so `2` must be to the right of our target. And we shrink the search space to (0,2]. \\n\\nThis time `mid=0+(2-0)/2`, which is `1`. But the `count=1`, which is less than or equal to `1`, meaning we are to the left to our target. And that\\'s how we finally converge to index `2`, which is also the answer.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we are going to do the count `logn` times, because it\\'s binary search. And for each count we will go through `n` numbers. So the time complexity is `O(nlogn)` and constant space.\\n\\n\\nThe code is pretty straight forward, just be mindful that we are binary searching on the index, which is sorted.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {\\n        int low=0, high=nums.length-1;\\n        while(low<high){\\n            int mid=low+(high-low)/2;\\n            int count=0;\\n            for(int num:nums){\\n                if(num<=mid) count++;\\n            }\\n            if(count<=mid){\\n                low=mid+1;\\n            }else{\\n                high=mid;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        // return low or high, since they are the same\\n        return low;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Suppose we want to build an acyclic counter-example, we can start from index 0, assign a value x, go to node with index x, rinse and repeat. Notice this action is essentially building and following a continuous chain of nodes.\n\nWe want to avoid any cycle so need to avoid assigning x if node with index x has already been used (i.e. a node on the current chain). We can obey this rule all the way until the very last unassigned node (whatever its index is in [1,n]). At this point, we have assigned n nodes so far, and so have no distinct value left to assign any more, so this node has to point to an old node somewhere on the chain, thus forming a cycle."
