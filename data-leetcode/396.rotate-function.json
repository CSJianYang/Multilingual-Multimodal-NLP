                "content": "\\u274C ***Solution - I (Brute-Force) [TLE]***\\n\\nLet\\'s start by trying to solve the problem in Brute-Force manner. To form structurally unique BST consisting of `n` nodes, we can start by taking any of the node `1...n` as the root node. Let the chosen root node be `i`. Then, we have a BST where the root node is `i`, the left child consist of all nodes from `1...i-1` (since left sub-tree must have only less than root\\'s value) and right child consist of all nodes from `i+1...n`.\\n\\n```python\\n\\t\\n              1            1                   2                    3               3\\n\\t           \\\\            \\\\                 / \\\\                  /               /\\n    \\t        3             2              1   3                2               1\\n               /               \\\\                                 /                 \\\\\\n              2                 3                              1                    2\\n                     i = 1                   i = 2                       i = 3           \\n(i = root node)\\n```\\n\\nNow, we need to realize that the number of structurally unique BST formable with nodes having value `i+1...n` is equal to the number of structurally unique BST formable with nodes having value `i+1-i...n-i = 1...n-i`. Why? Because we only need to find BST which are structurally unique irrespective of their values and we can form an equal number of them with nodes from `1...n` or `2...n+1` or `n...2n-1` and so on. So, the number only depends on number of nodes using which BST is to be formed.\\n\\nNow, when we choose `i` as root node, we will have nodes from `1...i-1` (`i-1` nodes in total) in left sub-tree and nodes from `i+1...n` (`n-i` nodes in total) in the right side. We can then form  `numTrees(i-1)` BSTs for left sub-tree and `numTrees(n-i)` BSTs for the right sub-tree. The total number of structurally unique BSTs formed having root `i` will be equal to product of these two, i.e, `numTrees(i-1) * numTrees(n-i)`. The same can be followed recursively till we reach base case - `numTrees(0) = numTrees(1) = 1` because we can form only a single empty BST and single node BST in these cases respectively.\\n\\nThe final answer will be summation of answers considering all `1...n` as root nodes.\\n\\n```python\\n           3                          2                         1               \\n          / \\\\                        / \\\\                      /   \\\\      \\nnumTrees(2) numTrees(0)    numTrees(1) numTrees(1)   numTrees(0) numTrees(2)              \\n         i = 3                      i = 2                     i = 1           \\n\\t\\t \\n                      i\\n\\t=>              /   \\\\ \\n         numTrees(i-1)\\tnumTrees(n-i)\\n```\\n\\nWith that in mind, we have the following - \\n\\n<p align=\\'middle\\'>\\n<img src=https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/be0cf3dd-364d-49d2-af1b-471be3a94855_1636332760.2597368.png />\\n</p>\\n\\n**C++**\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int numTrees(int n) {\\n        if(n <= 1) return 1;\\n        int ans = 0;\\n        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) \\n            ans += numTrees(i-1) * numTrees(n-i);\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Python**\\n\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n <= 1: return 1\\n        return sum(self.numTrees(i-1) * self.numTrees(n-i) for i in range(1, n+1))\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** <code><b>O(3<sup>N</sup>)</b></code>, where `N` is the given number of nodes in BST.

We can instead store or memoize these result and later avoid repeated calculations over and over again.\\n\\nThe approach and code will be very similar. The only change is every time we calculate the result for `numTrees(i)`, we store the result in `dp[i]` and only then return it. After that, each time we encounter `dp[i]` that\\'s already calculated, we can directly return the result. This way, we won\\'t solve for the same `numTrees(i)` multiple times. \\n\\n**C++**\\n \\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int dp[20]{};\\n    int numTrees(int n) {\\n        if(n <= 1) return 1;\\n        if(dp[n]) return dp[n];\\n        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) \\n            dp[n] += numTrees(i-1) * numTrees(n-i);\\n        return dp[n];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\\n**Python**\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    @cache\\n    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n <= 1: return 1\\n        return sum(self.numTrees(i-1) * self.numTrees(n-i) for i in range(1, n+1))\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** <code><b>O(N<sup>2</sup>)</b></code> \\nHere we calculate `numTrees(i)` (for `1<=i<=N`) only once and memoize it which will take `O(N)`.

Here we can use the idea of **dynamic programming**, let `dp[n]` be the number of unique Binary Search Trees with `n` nodes. How can we evaluate them: we need to choose number of nodes in the left subtree and number of nodes in the right subtree, for example `n=5`, then we have options:\\n1. left subtree has 0 nodes, root = 1, and right subtree has 4 nodes, number of options `f[0]*f[4]`\\n2. left subtree has 1 nodes, root = 2, and right subtree has 3 nodes, number of options `f[1]*f[3]`\\n3. left subtree has 2 nodes, root = 3, and right subtree has 2 nodes, number of options `f[2]*f[2]`\\n4. left subtree has 3 nodes, root = 4, and right subtree has 1 nodes, number of options `f[3]*f[1]`\\n5. left subtree has 4 nodes, root = 5, and right subtree has 0 nodes, number of options `f[4]*f[0]`\\n\\nSo, in total `f[5] = f[0]*f[4] + f[1]*f[3] + f[2]*f[2] + f[3]*f[1] + f[4]*f[0]`, and in general:\\n`f[n] = f[0]*f[n-1] + f[1]*f[n-2] + ... + f[n-2]*f[1] + f[n-1]*f[0]`.\\n\\nWe can solve this in classical **dynamic programming** way with `O(n^2)` complexity.

The empty left subtree is still a subtree, so `G(0) = 1`.\\n- `i = 2`: `F(2, n) = G(1) x G(n - 2)`. With one node we can only construct one unique left subtree, so `G(1) = 1`.\\n\\nFinally, we have the recurrence:\\n\\n`G(n) = \\\\sum^n_{i=1}F(i,n) = \\\\sum^n_{i=1} G(i - 1) x G(n - i)`\\n`\\\\text{where}\\\\ \\\\  G(0)=1, G(1)=1`\\n\\nHere is the code without memoization.\\n\\n```java\\n// numTress(n) is G(n)\\npublic int numTrees(int n) {\\n  if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n    return 1;\\n  }\\n  int sum = 0;\\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\\n    sum += numTrees(i - 1) * numTrees(n - i);\\n  }\\n  return sum;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHere is the recurrence tree:\\n\\n```java\\n                               G(4)\\n                     /      |        |        \\\\\\n             G(0)G(3)     G(1)G(2)  G(2)G(1)   G(3)G(0)        // 4\\n            /    |    \\\\\\n    G(0)G(2)  G(1)G(1)  G(2)G(0)                               // 4 x 3\\n    /     \\\\\\nG(0)G(1)  G(1)G(0) // base case                                // 4 x 3 x 2\\n```\\n\\n`C(N) = N x N!`\\n\\n**Time:** It is at most bounded by `O(N x N!)`. A tighter bound would be Catalan number times `N` since we\\'ve done `N` times, which is `N x G_N = O(N x \\\\frac{4^N}{N^{3/2}}) = O(\\\\frac{4^N}{N^{1/2}})`.\\n**Space:** `O(N)`\\n\\nExamining the recurrence carefully, we find that there are repeated calculations.\\n\\n```java\\nG(3) = G(0) x G(2)  // i = 1\\n     = G(1) x G(1)  // i = 2\\n     = G(2) x G(0)  // i = 3\\n\\nG(4) = G(0) x G(3)  // i = 1\\n     = G(1) x G(2)  // i = 2\\n     = G(2) x G(1)  // i = 3\\n     = G(3) x G(0)  // i = 4\\n```\\n\\nTherefore, we can use a `hash map` or an `integer array` to store calculated `G(n)`. Here is the hash map version.\\n\\n```java\\nMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\\npublic int numTrees(int n) {\\n  if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n    return 1;\\n  }\\n  int sum = 0;\\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\\n    if (!map.containsKey(i - 1)) {\\n      map.put(i - 1, numTrees(i - 1));\\n    }\\n    if (!map.containsKey(n - i)) {\\n      map.put(n - i, numTrees(n - i));\\n    }\\n    sum += map.get(i - 1) * map.get(n - i);\\n  }\\n  return sum;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHere is the recurrence tree:\\n\\n```java\\n                               G(4)\\n                     /      |        |        \\\\\\n             G(0)G(3)     G(1)G(2)  G(2)G(1)   G(3)G(0)\\n            /    |    \\\\\\n    G(0)G(2)  G(1)G(1)  G(2)G(0)\\n    /     \\\\\\nG(0)G(1)  G(1)G(0) // base case\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** Without memoization, the time complexity is upper bounded by `O(N x N!)`.\\n\\nBy calculating the leftmost nodes, we have `G(0), G(1), ..., G(N)`, which takes `O(N)` time. Besides, we have to do product computations at each level, which takes `2 + 3 + 4 + ... + N = O(N^2)` time in total.\\n\\n**Time:** `O(N^2)`\\n**Space:** `O(N)` because of call stacks.\\n\\n\\n### DP (Iteration)\\n\\nBy observation, we can construct our solution by a bottom-up approach.\\n\\nThe recurrence formula: `G(n) = \\\\sum^n_i G(i - 1) x G(n - i)`\\n\\nFor example, `G(4) = G(0) x G(3) + G(1) x G(2) + G(2) x G(1) + G(3) x G(0)`\\n\\n```java\\nG(0) G(1)\\n// With these initially two base-case values, we can calculate G(2)\\nG(0) G(1) G(2)\\n// With these three values we have G(3)\\nG(0) G(1) G(2) G(3)\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** Notice that it is `G[i - j]` instead of `G[n - j]` and it is `j <= i` instead of `j <= n`.\\n\\n```java\\npublic int numTrees(int n) {\\n  int[] G = new int[n + 1];\\n  G[0] = 1; G[1] = 1; // init\\n  for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {\\n    for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) { // sum\\n      G[i] += G[j - 1] * G[i - j];\\n    }\\n  }\\n  return G[n];\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Time:** `O(N^2)`\\n**Space:** `O(N)`\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Mathematical Deduction\\n\\nThe sequence of `G(n)` function results is known as `Catelan number` `C_n`.\\n\\n![](https://bloggg-1254259681.cos.na-siliconvalley.myqcloud.com/0bq2c.png)\\n\\n**Note:** Use `long` type.\\n\\n```java\\nC = 2 * (2 * i + 1) / (i + 2) * C;\\n```\\n\\n\\nIf we put `C` at the end of the statement, the result is not correct. **Do all multiplications first!** For example, when `i = 2` and `C_2 = 2`, we would have:\\n\\n- `C = 2 * (2 * 2 + 1) / (2 + 2) * C_2 = 2 * (5) / 4 * 2 = 10 / 4 * 2 = 4`\\n- instead of `C = 2 * 10 / 4 = 5`.\\n\\n```java\\npublic int numTrees(int n) {\\n  long C = 1;\\n  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { // i stops at n - 1\\n    C = C * 2 * (2 * i + 1) / (i + 2); // calculate C_i+1\\n  }\\n  return (int) C;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Time:** `O(N)`\\n**Space:** `O(1)`",

The answer is 1. \\nFor ```2``` we can construct ```2``` different trees: One of the node is root, the second one can either be a left child or right child.\\n```\\nn = 2\\n\\n   1                            1\\n  /              or               \\\\\\n2\\t                                2\\n```\\nEasy!\\nWhat about n=3?\\n```\\n   1         3     3      2      1\\n    \\\\       /     /      / \\\\      \\\\\\n\\t---------------------------------- Let\\'s cut the trees from here\\n     3     2     1      1   3      2\\n    /     /       \\\\                 \\\\\\n   2     1         2                 3\\n ```\\nAs you can see, from where we cut, the bottom of the tree is actually another tree where the same logic applies. So the only thing we need to decide is how to distrubute the remaining nodes to childs of the root. The options can be:\\n```\\n------num of nodes------\\nleft_child   right_child\\n     0             2 --> These are the subtrees, like the new trees with n = 0 and n = 2\\n     1             1\\n     2             0\\n```\\nTo find how many possible solutions are there for n=3, add up all these possibilities . We can call the same function for calculating the values in all the options because it is actually the same problem. \\nTo sum up, we picked the root and then we need to decide on how the left and right subtrees will look like. The options are how many nodes can be on the left and right subtree at the same time.\\n\\n```\\n       -------------- 3 ---------------\\n\\t  /\\t\\t          |                \\\\\\n  /      \\\\\\t      /      \\\\\\t \\t   /\\t    \\\\\\n  0     --2--    1        1     --2--        0\\n       /     \\\\                 /     \\\\  \\n\\t /\\\\       /\\\\             /\\\\       /\\\\\\n\\t1  0     0  1           1  0     0  1\\n\\n```\\nHere is my attempt to draw the recursion tree. Even for a small n value there are multiple overlapping problems. So I used a memoization table and saved the values on that table before returning the total value from the function and if the value that we are looking for exists on the table, return that value without doing any extra calculations.\\n\\nHere is the code:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        self.table = [-1] * (n+1)\\n        self.table[0] = 1\\n        return self.numTreesRec(n)\\n        \\n    def numTreesRec(self, n):\\n        if self.table[n] != -1:\\n            return self.table[n]\\n        total = 0\\n        for m in range(n):\\n            total += (self.numTreesRec(n-1-m) * self.numTreesRec(m))\\n        self.table[n] = total\\n        return total\\n```\\n\\n**2. Dynamic Programming**\\nNow, we have our recursive solution. As you can see from the above recursion tree, values are calculated starting from 0 and then 1 and goes like this until n. The means we can do it iteratively. We can start from 1 (n=0 are our base case) and calculate the values upto n. So, I created a dp table and the solution for n = i is stored at dp[i]. Now, if we go back to our example, for n=3:\\n```\\n0 2 \\n1 1\\n2 0\\n```\\nWe have these options for distributing the remaining nodes to subtrees. We already calculated the values for 0, 1 and 2 because we used iterative approach. Therefore solution for dp[3] will be\\n```\\ndp[3] = dp[0] * dp[2] + dp[1] * dp[1] + dp[2] * dp[0]\\n```\\n\\nwhich is done by the inner for loop in the code.\\n\\nHere is the code:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        dp = [0] * (n+1)\\n        dp[0] = 1\\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\\n            for j in range(i):\\n                dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i- 1 - j]\\n        return dp[n]\\n```\\n\\nThe time complexity is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(n). There is a better solution by using catalan numbers. \\n\\nI tried  my best to explain how I think when solving  a dp problem. Hope that it helps and don\\'t worry if you are having diffuculties.

Choose 1 as root, no element present on left-subtree. N-1 elements present on the right subtree.\\n\\n2. Choose 2 as root, 1 element present on the left-subtree.

And finding unique BST with n nodes is one of the applications of catalan numbers!\\n\\n**Time Complexity:** O(N^2)\\n\\nBelow is the code for my approach:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int numTrees(int n) {\\n        vector<int>cat(n+1, 0);\\n        \\n        cat[0] = 1;\\n        cat[1] = 1;\\n        \\n        for(int i{2}; i<=n; ++i){\\n            \\n            for(int j{}; j<i; ++j){\\n                \\n                cat[i] += cat[j]*cat[i-j-1];\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return cat[n];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Approach 2 (Recursive DP):** \\n\\n1. My intuition is that if we have numbers from `1` to `N`, then we will make each `i` as root once, and then send the nodes `(1 to i-1)` to the` left subtree` and the nodes` (i+1 to N)` to the` right subtree.`\\n\\n2.  Note that the unique subtree for nodes `(1 to X)` is same as unique subtrees for `(X+1 to 2X)`, i.e., if we have `X` number of nodes irrespective of their values then the unique BST for those nodes will be same no matter what value they holds. For eg: the nodes 3 4 5 will make same number of unique BST as the nodes with values 7 8 9 as the number of nodes is same.\\n\\n3. So in our recursive solution, for a node `i` that will be root, then `numTrees(i-1)` will give answer for our `left subtree` for nodes `(1 to i-1)` and `numTrees(N-i)` will give answer for our right subtree for nodes `(i+1 to n)` because we will have `(N-i)` number of nodes in this range and we only care about the `number of nodes`.\\n\\n4. And then the answer for our node i will be the product of answer of left subtree and answer of right subtree, i.e. , `numTrees(i-1) * numTrees(N-i)`.\\n\\n5. We will store our precomputed answers in our dp vector so that no repeated call is made for same number.\\n\\n**Time Complexity:** O(N^2)\\n\\nHere is the code for my approach mentioned above:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    \\n    int solve(int n, vector<int>&dp){\\n        if(n <= 1) return 1;\\n        if(dp[n] != -1) return dp[n];\\n        \\n        int res{};\\n        \\n        for(int i{1}; i<=n; ++i)\\n            res += solve(i-1, dp)*solve(n-i, dp);\\n        \\n        return dp[n] = res;\\n    }\\n    \\n    int numTrees(int n) {\\n        vector<int>dp(n+1, -1);\\n        return solve(n, dp);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n",

                "content": "##### Method1: Recursion (TLE) [T(n) = O(3^n) and S(n) = O(n) [recursion stack]]\\nProblem is to find the no. of BSTs that are possible for given n: no. of nodes in BST. To solve this recursively, we need to build a recurrance relation [Inductive Hypothesis] and a base case.\\n`Let C(n) := no. of unique BSTs possible with n no. of nodes where n >= 0` \\nClearly, a null node and a single node, both are BSTs (only 1 unique BST for each). So, we have got our base case i.e `C(0) = C(1) = 1` or`C(n) = 1 when n <= 1`.\\nNow, Let\\'s break `n nodes of BST` into `1, i - 1, and n - i nodes`, where, 1 node is given to root, i - 1 nodes are given to left BST subtree and n - i nodes are given to right BST subtree respectively s.t overall we still have `1 + i - 1 + n - i = n nodes`. Cleary here, `1 <= i <= n` as both left and right BST subtrees can have: `atleast 0 and atmost n - 1 nodes`.\\n```\\n\\t\\t   (1)\\n\\t\\t  /   \\\\\\n\\t (i - 1)  (n - i)\\n\\t   \\ns.t total BST nodes are: 1 + i - 1 + n - i = n nodes\\nwhere (x) denotes x no. of nodes in BST and 1 <= i <= n\\n```\\nNow, we know that: `C(n) depends on C(i - 1) and C(n - i) where 1 <= i <= n`.\\nUpon experimentation, we can observe: `C(2) = C(0) * C(1) + C(1) * C(0) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\\n```\\n1                   2\\n  \\\\                /\\n\\t2            1\\ni = 1          i = 2\\n```\\nSimilarly, `C(3) = C(0) * C(2) + C(1) * C(1) + C(2) * C(0) = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5`.\\n```\\n   1                1                2                  3                 3\\n\\t\\\\                \\\\              / \\\\                /                 /\\n\\t 2                3            1   3              2                 1\\n      \\\\              /                               /                   \\\\\\n\\t   3            2                               1                     2\\n  i = 1            i = 1           i = 2         i = 3               i = 3         \\n```\\nSo, we have the recurrance relation: `C(n) := sum(C(i - 1) * C(n - i)), 1 <= i <= n`.\\n\\n**NOTE:** \\n1. Regarding the Time Complexity of above recurrance relation, please read [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27371612/catalan-numbers-recursive-function-time-complexity) for more details.\\n2. This problem is actually the application of *[nth Catalan Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number)* [See Method4 Below for its implementation].\\n\\n```\\nint numTrees(int n) {\\n\\t// base case\\n\\tif (n <= 1) return 1;\\n\\tint ans = 0;\\n\\t// recursion\\n\\tfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)\\n\\t\\tans += numTrees(i - 1) * numTrees(n - i);\\n\\treturn ans;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n##### Method2: Recursion + Memoization (AC) [T(n) = O(n^2) and S(n) = O(n)] \\nIf you have understood the basics explained in Method1, it is obvious to see the overlapping subproblems in C(n), so, we can definitely use cache (called memoization) [:= memo in code] to solve subproblems only once in Top Down Approach. It drastically improves the Time Complexity from exponential to Polynomial (Quadratic) as now each subproblem is solved exactly once.\\n\\n```\\n// recursion + memoization\\nint numTrees(int n, vector<int> &memo) {\\n\\t// base case\\n\\tif (n <= 1) return 1;\\n\\t// if subProblem is not solved\\n\\tif (not memo[n])\\n\\t\\t// recursion\\n\\t\\tfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)\\n\\t\\t\\tmemo[n] += numTrees(i - 1, memo) * numTrees(n - i, memo);\\n\\t// return solved subProblem\\n\\treturn memo[n];\\n}\\n\\n// main\\nint numTrees(int n) {\\n\\t// init memo\\n\\tvector<int> memo(20);\\n\\treturn numTrees(n, memo);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n##### Method3: DP (AC) [T(n) = O(n^2) and S(n) = O(n)]\\nIf you have understood above methods, its not difficult to convert Method2 into Bottom Up DP. A nice trick is to first initialise the DP and then, replace in Method2, `n by i and i by j and func call by DP using two for loops` and we are done!\\nWe have now removed the explicit recursion stack space: O(n) from Method2 using this Bottom Up DP solution. The time and space complexity however remains same.\\n\\n```\\nint numTrees(int n) {\\n\\t// init dp\\n\\tvector<int> dp(n + 1);\\n\\tdp[0] = dp[1] = 1;\\n\\t// fill dp\\n\\tfor(int i = 2; i <= n; i++)\\n\\t\\tfor(int j = 1;  j <= i; j++)\\n\\t\\t\\tdp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];\\n\\t// return ans\\n\\treturn dp[n];\\n}\\n```\\n\\n##### Method4: Nth Catalan Number using Math (AC) [T(n) = O(n) and S(n) = O(1)]\\n![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/58374aa2b2e2c016a5b313e2bbd59940a2e1a5f9)\\n\\n**NOTE:**\\n1. This method is not intuitive and requires Combinatorics as pre-requisite, but I am still presenting it here for your reference.\\n1. I have used `long double` instead of `long long` in the code below because `long long` would lead to `int division` (kind of `floor` of what we need in the subsequent products) and thus will result into wrong answer. So, use `long double` instead to get the right division in subsequent products and thus the right answer. Finally, since the return type of func. is `int`, so the ans is type-casted by compiler to `int`:)\\n\\n```\\nint numTrees(int n) {\\n\\tlong double ans = 1;\\n\\tfor (int k = 2; k <= n; k++)\\n\\t\\tans *= (n + k), ans /= k;\\n\\treturn ans;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**NOTE:**\\n*If you find this post helpful then please **upvote**.

The question is simply asking the sum of different combinations of BST if every number between 1 - n is used as a root node\\n2. If number `i` is the root node, then the total combinations for `i` will equal to the combination of BST to its left `[1... i-1]` times the combination of BST to its right `[i+1]...n`. \\n3. Think of BST are just combination of nodes instead of actual numbers, this means, the BST combinations for [1,2,3,4] equals to the BST combinations for [7,8,9,10] because they all have 4 elements. \\n4. When we calculate the product of left & right, we are mix and match different combinations of BST.

As because we need to consider all the structurally unique BST combinations which we can get via rearranging the nodes in the left and right subtree of the root node.\\n\\nSimilarly, when **n = 5**, the total number of structurally unique BST\\'s would be: \\n```\\ndp[5] = dp[4] + (dp[1] * dp[3]) + (dp[2] * dp[2]) + (dp[3] * dp[1]) + dp[4]\\n\\t\\t = 14 + (1 * 5) + (2 * 2) + (5 * 1) + 14\\n         = 42\\n```\\n\\nIf n = 5, we can calculate the result, if we know the number of structurally unique BST\\'s possible when n = 4, 3, 2 and 1.\\nThus, we can see the presence of overlapping sub-problems, and in order to avoid the repetitive computation of the same set of sub-problems we would store the result of a computed sub-problem (here we are using an 1D array \\'dp\\'), and access it in future as and when needed. \\n\\nNow, a bit careful observation, and we can spot a pattern like this:\\n```\\n(dp[0] * dp[n - 1]) +\\n(dp[1] * dp[n - 2]) +\\n(dp[2] * dp[n - 3]) +\\n.... + \\n(dp[n - 1] * dp[0]).\\n```\\n\\nAs evident from above that, if dp[0] is 0, it will make `(dp[0] * dp[n - 1])` and `(dp[n - 1] * dp[0])` result to 0. Hence, we initialize dp[0] as 1.\\n\\nWe compute the result sequentially, (i.e. when i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n ) according to pattern described as follows:\\n```\\nfor (int i = 1; i < n + 1; ++i) {\\n\\tfor (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {\\n\\t\\tdp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1];\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWoohoo !

Read ( range(0,n) in python)\\n4. Now since we know the number of nodes in left and right subtrees, we can recursively call the function on these.\\n5. Our base case if n == 0, which is 1 because if n = 0, only null/empty tree would be present.\\n\\n**Basic/Naive Algorithm**\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n == 0:\\n            return 1\\n        numSubtrees = 0\\n        for leftSubtreeNodeCount in range(n):\\n            rightSubtreeNodeCount = n - 1 - leftSubtreeNodeCount\\n            leftSubtrees = self.numTrees(leftSubtreeNodeCount)\\n            rightSubtrees = self.numTrees(rightSubtreeNodeCount)\\n            numSubtrees += leftSubtrees * rightSubtrees\\n        return numSubtrees\\n```\\n\\n**With memoization to prevent calculating for same n multiple times.

If it\\'s just 1 node, it\\'s obvious that there will be only possibility\\n\\n**Case 2 :**\\n\\nFor 2 nodes (n = 2), there will be two possibilities \\n1. ```1```node as root and ```2```as right child\\n2. ```2```node as root and ```1```as left child\\n\\n\\nFrom the above, it can also be observed that irrespective of the node values, two nodes with ascending values will always have only 2 combinations.\\n\\n**Case 3 :**\\n\\nFor finding the number of combinations for n = 3, the possible root values are ```1, 2, 3``` \\n1.

If we have ```2```as root, ```1```will be on the left and ```3```will be on the right which boils down to ```case 1``` which is 1 possibility\\n3. If we have ```3```as root, ```2, 1```will be on the left which again boils down to ```case 2```which is 2 possibility\\n\\nIf we add all the combinations, it\\'s 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 combinations.

For any value of n, there will be \\'n\\' possible values of root and for each root node, there will be certain number of left and right subtrees totalling all of which gives the total number of combinations. For example, if we take n = 4, the possible root values are 1 to 4. For each root node value from 1 to 4, \\n1. the number of left nodes can be calculated by subracting the current root node value by 1\\n2. the number of right nodes can be calculated by subracting the total number of nodes by the current value\\n\\nThat is for dp[4], it\\'s the sum of\\n1. dp[0] * dp[3] => for root node \\'1\\' [0 left child, 3 right child]\\n2. dp[1] * dp[2] => for root node \\'2\\' [1 left child, 2 right child]\\n3. dp[2] * dp[1] => for root node \\'3\\' [2 left child, 1 right child]\\n4. dp[3] * dp[0] => for root node \\'4\\' [3 left child, 0 right child]\\n\\nSince, it\\'s obvious that there is a lot of re-computation, we can store the result of each computation against that certain number of nodes and reuse it.\\n\\n**Code :**\\n\\n```\\npublic int numTrees(int n) {\\n\\t\\t// array to cache the number of combinations against node count\\n        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];\\n\\t\\t// base case\\n\\t\\tdp[0] = dp[1] = 1;\\n\\t\\t// traversing from 1 to n even though we need the result of n because for finding the nth node, we need the sub nodes value.\\n        for (int node = 2; node <= n; ++node) {\\n\\t\\t\\t// for each root node, calculating the left and right node count and finding the number of possible combinations from the cached array\\n            for (int root = 1; root <= node; ++root) {\\n                int left = root - 1, right = node - root;\\n                dp[node] += dp[left] * dp[right];\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\t\\t// returning the last count since it gives the nth count\\n        return dp[n];\\n    }",

                "content": "### Introduction\\n\\nConsider the nodes with values ```1 - n``` in a list-like representation as follows:\\n\\n```\\n[ 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n - 2, n - 1, n ]\\n  ^                              ^\\n  |                              |\\nstart                           end\\n```\\n\\nHere, ```start``` refers to the node with the least value, and ```end``` refers to the node with the greatest value. The  goal is to find the number of unique structural binary search trees (BST) that can be formed from ```start``` to ```end```, inclusive.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Breaking it down\\n\\nConsider the simple example ```n = 3```. We have the following cases:\\n\\n1. ```start``` is the root node of the BST.\\n\\n```\\n[ 1, 2, 3 ]\\n  ^     ^\\n  |     |\\nstart  end\\n root\\n```\\n\\nPer BST rules, the remaining nodes with values 2 and 3 are to be added to the right subtree of the root node ```start```. How the remaining nodes are to be added is not of concern. But, **since the left subtree is left empty**, the number of distinct structural BSTs that can be formed **depend on the number of distinct structural BSTs that form from the right subtree**.\\n\\n2. ```end``` is the root node of the BST.\\n\\n```\\n[ 1, 2, 3 ]\\n  ^     ^\\n  |     |\\nstart  end\\n       root\\n```\\n\\nSimilar to case 1, the remaining nodes with values 1 and 2 have to be added to the left subtree. Since the right subtree is left empty, the number of distinct structural BSTs depend on the number of distinct structural BSTs that form from the left subtree.\\n\\nGeneralising cases 1 and 2, **if one subtree has _```N```_ distinct structures, and the other subtree is empty (```0``` distinct structures), then the BST represented by the current node has _```N```_ distinct structures.**\\n\\n3. The node with value 2 is the root of the BST.\\n\\n```\\n[ 1,    2,    3 ]\\n  ^     ^     ^\\n  |     |     |\\nstart  root  end\\n```\\n\\nAccordingly, the ```start``` node becomes the left subtree, and the ```end``` node becomes the right subtree. Since there is only one node at either subtree, the number of distinct structural BST subtrees for both the left and right subtrees is 1. Therefore, there is only 1 possible BST structure if the root node has value 2.\\n\\nWe can generalise this case as follows: **For any given node, if one subtree has _M_ distinct structures, and the other subtree has _N_ distinct structures (_```M```_```, ```_```N```_```> 0```), the BST with the node as its root will have _```M```_``` x ```_```N```_ distinct structures**.\\n\\nTo see why this is the case, consider the following illustration:\\n\\n```\\nConsider the root node of a given BST. Label as root.\\n\\nLabel the distinct structures of the left subtree as follows:\\nL1, L2, L3, ..., Lm.  --> Total of M distinct structures, M > 0.\\n\\nLabel the distinct structures of the right subtree as follows:\\nR1, R2, R3, ..., Rn.  --> Total of N distinct structures, N > 0.\\n\\nThen, the following BST structures are all distinct:\\n\\n   root           root           root                 root\\n  /    \\\\         /    \\\\         /    \\\\      ...      /    \\\\\\nL1      R1     L1      R2     L1      R3           L1      Rn\\n\\n   root           root           root                 root\\n  /    \\\\         /    \\\\         /    \\\\      ...      /    \\\\\\nL2      R1     L2      R2     L2      R3           L2      Rn\\n\\n...\\n\\n   root           root           root                 root\\n  /    \\\\         /    \\\\         /    \\\\      ...      /    \\\\\\nLm      R1     Lm      R2     Lm      R3           Lm      Rn\\n\\nM rows x N columns = MN distinct structures.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Implementation\\n\\nUsing ```start``` and ```end``` as \"pointers\", we can tell our function:\\n\\n- Which portion of the BST we are working on.\\n- How many nodes to consider as the current root node.\\n\\nWe can also cache our results so that they don\\'t need to be recomputed later.\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        cache = {}  # to store results\\n        \\n        def dp(start: int, end: int) -> int:\\n            if end <= start:  # this is an invalid subsequence of nodes\\n                return 1      # return 1 because 1 will not affect the multiplication formula\\n            elif (start, end) in cache.keys():\\n                return cache[(start, end)]  # use saved result\\n            result = 0\\n            for i in range(end-start+1):          # let each node be the root node once\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t# now that the node start+i is the root node,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t# left subtree: start ~ (start+i)-1,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t# right subtree: (start+i)+1 ~ end\\n                result += dp(start, start+i-1) \\\\  # distinct structures of the left subtree\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t* dp(start+i+1, end)      # distinct structures of the right subtree\\n            cache[(start, end)] = result  # store the result\\n            return result\\n        \\n        return dp(1, n)  # inclusive\\n```\\n\\n**EDIT:** We can get rid of the inner `dp()` function by calling `numTrees` with `end-start` instead.\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    @cache\\n    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n <= 1:\\n            return 1\\n        result = 0\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            result += self.numTrees(i)*self.numTrees(n-i-1)\\n        return result\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Final Result\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/ad4f746e-9804-4ef8-bbed-2638a1861c53_1634144681.9373739.png)\\n\\nPlease upvote if this has helped you!

                "content": "Read [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/discuss/703488/Detailed-Explanation-%3A-Mental-Leap-on-Why-the-approach-actually-works) first to get a better idea of how we\\'re going to proceed. \\n\\nThe high level idea is that for whatever `n` you assume, you have right and left sub-trees! Each of these sub-trees can be further broken down into smaller pieces. The first way that might come to your mind is to find the unique trees for each `n` (check [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/discuss/31761/Python-with-explanation.-I-guess-you-could-call-this-%22DP%22...) out) and sum all of them to get to the total unique trees. If that\\'s what you have in mind, you can come up with something like this:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        if n == 0 or n == 1:\\n            return 1\\n        unique_trees = 0\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            left_trees = self.numTrees(i)\\n            right_trees = self.numTrees(n-i-1)\\n            unique_trees += left_trees*right_trees\\n            \\n        return unique_trees\\n```\\n\\nThis solution, altough correct, would give you time limit error when you submit it. This is because we\\'re trying to solve `numTrees` multiple times for every `n` (which is not required right?). Better would be to store what you once calculated and use it for later calculations. There are two ways of doing this: 1) bottom-up and 2) top-down.The main difference between the approach is that one start from bases cases when `n=0` or `n=1`. However, in the top-down, we assume different values as the root node and calculate unique left and right subtrees with all the n values.\\n\\n**1) Bottom-up**\\nIn this approach (as you see in a lot of posts in the discussion), you build from base cases ( `n=0` and `n=1`) to the desired `n`. Following code is doing such a thing. You initialize a `cache` array to keep track of already calculated cases. When `n = 0`, we have one tree. Similarly, when is `n=1`, we have one tree. For `n >= 2`, we follow similar approach to the above solution (that was top-down approach). For each value of `n >=2` (let\\'s say `n=3`), we calculate unique trees assuming all the numbers from `1` to `n` as root. In the case of `n=3`, we assume `1`, `2` and `3` to be root and calculate corresponding unique subtrees and sum them up (line `#1` and `#2`). And, finally, the last entry of `cache` is what we\\'re looking for. \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        cache = [0]*(n+1)\\n        cache[0] = 1\\n        cache[1] = 1\\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\\n            for j in range(i): #1\\n                cache[i] += cache[j]*cache[i -j - 1] #2\\n            \\n        return cache[-1]\\n```\\n\\n\\n**1) Top-down**\\nIt\\'s different than bottom-up in a sense that it assumes all `n` numbers in the game every time, and just tries to change `root` value by looping over different numbers from `1` to `n`. The general idea is similar to the first solution of this post (the one with time error). \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:\\n\\n        cache = [-1]*(n+1)\\n        cache[0] = 1\\n        cache[1] = 1\\n        return self.helper(n, cache)\\n    \\n    def helper(self, n, cache):\\n        if cache[n] != -1:\\n            return cache[n]\\n        \\n        \\n        unique_trees = 0\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            left_trees = self.helper(i, cache)\\n            right_trees = self.helper(n - i -1, cache)\\n            unique_trees += left_trees*right_trees\\n        cache[n] = unique_trees\\n        return unique_trees\\n```\\n\\nThat\\'s it! \\n\\n=================================================\\nFinal note: Please let me know if you found any typo/error/etc. I\\'ll try to fix it. \\n\\n",

                "content": "Before we reach the DP solution, it is useful to first think about recursion.\\n\\nWhen we first see the problem, we can try to come up with some examples to see if there are any patterns involved. Since `n = 3` is given in the problem, let\\'s try `n = 4`, with nodes [1, 2, 3, 4]. To find the number of trees systematically, we can start by letting the first node (i.e. 1) be the root node, and then let the second node be the root node and so on.\\n\\nFor the case where the root node is 1, how many possible BSTs are there? We know that everything on the left hand side must be less than the root, and everything on the right hand side must be more than the root. Since nothing is smaller than the root node here, the number of nodes on the left subtree is 0. Meanwhile, [2, 3, 4] are all larger than 1, and belong to the right subtree, so the right subtree has 3 roots. This means that we need to find the number of BSTs for the right subtree....which is essentially `numTrees(n - 1)`.\\n\\nSo we notice a pattern here:\\n- any value <= n can become the root node\\n- any value smaller than the current root node forms the left subtree\\n- any value bigger than the current root node forms the right subtree\\n- the total number of BSTs for the left subtree is `numTrees(# of nodes in leftTree)`\\n- the total number of BSTs for the right subtree is `numTrees(# of nodes in rightTree)`\\n- the total number of BSTs for the entire tree is `numTrees(# of nodes in leftTree) * numTrees(# of nodes in rightTree)` (by simple combinatorics)\\n\\nNow, we can write out a recursive solution:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int numTrees(int n) {\\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        \\n        int totalWays = 0;\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t// i is the possible number of nodes in the left subtree\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            totalWays += numTrees(i) * numTrees(n - i - 1);\\n        }\\n        \\n        return totalWays;   \\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis solution works. However, we can make it better - there are repeated computations being done in the `for` loop. Let\\'s improve things using DP by storing the computed results in an array:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int numTrees(int n) {\\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        \\n        int[] nums = new int[n + 1];\\n        nums[0] = 1;\\n        nums[1] = 1;\\n        \\n\\t\\t// computing bottom-up to tree with size n\\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\\n            int totalWays = 0;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t// j is the number of possible nodes in the left subtree\\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\\n                totalWays += nums[j] * nums[i - j - 1];\\n            }\\n            nums[i] = totalWays;\\n        }\\n\\n        return nums[n];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis is a solution that beats 100% of the other solutions in terms of the runtime.",

Finally, we can multiply the number of unique BSTs in the left and right subtrees and add it to the total count.\\n\\nTherefore, for i nodes, the number of unique BSTs that can be formed is given by the formula:\\n```\\ndp[i] = dp[0]*dp[i-1] + dp[1]*dp[i-2] + ... + dp[i-1]*dp[0]\\n```\\nThe above formula takes into account all the possible combinations of left and right subtrees.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(n^2)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(n) Beats\\n95.38%\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:\\n        # initialize the dp array with base cases\\n        dp = [0] * (n + 1)\\n        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1\\n        \\n        # calculate the number of unique BSTs for i nodes\\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\\n            for j in range(1, i + 1):\\n                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j]\\n        \\n        return dp[n]\\n\\n```",

My first intuition would be using `dynamic programming` to solve for this since it falls into the one of three common categories that can be solved by dynamic programming.\\n* Dynamica programming requires us to find out the [optimal subsubstructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) for the problem, which is the core to solve this problem. If we are able to find out the optimal substructure, we then usually break the current problem into several subproblems, solve subproblems and evenually we are able to solve the original problem using the solutions to its subproblems\\n* For example, let say `n = 3`, then there will be three nodes in the BST which are `1`, `2` and `3`. As shown in the problem description, each of these three values can be treated as the root for BST. Let\\'s treat `2` as the root of BST, then according to the property of BST, `1` has to be in its left subtree and `3` has to be in its right subtree. How many possible left subtree it can be, given the fact that this BST only contain one element which is `1`. Obviously, there is only one possible form of the left subtree. Similarly, there is only one possible form of the right subtree. As a result, given the root is `2`, and there is one possible left subtree that can be formed, one possible right subtree that can be formed. Together there will be only `1 * 1 = 1` possible form of BST that can be formed, given the root is `2`\\n* Observing the example above, we\\'ve found the `optimal substructure` of this problem: given `n`, if we choose root to be `i` where `1 <= i <= n`, then the number of possible BSTs can be formed is this case is the `number of possible left subtree (still a BST)` `*` `number of possible right subtree (still a BST)`. The left subtree will be using values from `0 to i - 1` so that their solution is just the solution to subproblem where `n = i - 1` and the right subtree will be using values from `i + 1 to n`, so that their solution is just the solution to the subproblem where `n = n (the original n) - i`. Eventually, the total number of BST that can be formed is just the sum of number of BST that can be formed with `1` as the root, with `2` as the root and so on.\\n* state transfer function: define `C(n)` as the total number of possible BSTs that can be formed using values from `1 to n`, then the recursive relation is that `C(n) = summation of C(i - 1) * C(n - i)` where `1 <= i <= n`\\n* base case: `C(0) = 1`\\n\\nSolution:\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int numTrees(int n) {\\n        if (n < 0) return 1;\\n        \\n        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];\\n        // base case: dp[0] = 1 to avoid possible index out of bound exceptions\\n        dp[0] = 1;\\n        \\n        // state transfer function: dp[n] = summation of dp[i - 1] * dp[n - i] where 1 <= i <= n\\n        for (int nn = 1; nn <= n; ++nn) {\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= nn; ++i) {\\n                dp[nn] += dp[i - 1] * dp[nn - i];\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return dp[n];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```js\\nvar numTrees = function(n) {\\n  // state: dp[i] => number of different BST can be formed using 1...n\\n  // state transfer function:\\n  // take j as the root, where 1 <= j <= i\\n  // the number of different left subtree: dp[j - 1]\\n  // the number of different right subtree: dp[i - j]\\n  // dp[i] = sum(dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j] for 1 <= j <= i)\\n  // base case:\\n  // dp[0] = 1\\n  // dp[1] = 1\\n  const dp = Array(n + 1).fill(0);\\n  dp[0] = 1;\\n  dp[1] = 1;\\n\\n  for (let i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {\\n    for (let j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {\\n      dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];\\n    }\\n  }\\n  return dp[n];\\n};\\n```\\n\\nHappy Coding~",

                "content": "So lets start from the most basic solution that is recursion. Now consider we have n nodes and each of these nodes are candidates for root node right. So lets say we have node i as the root what are possible number of structurally unique BSTs? It would be ```numTress(number of nodes on left side) * numTrees(number of nodes on right side)``` right.\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/2e8a3386-bde7-48e8-9d4c-0dd0ebc78cd6_1642027238.033934.png)\\nwhere ```C(i-1)``` represents number of structurally unique BSTs from i-1 nodes. And for each node we would find the possible number and simply add. So thinking about the base case for this recursion if n<2 we would have no node or one node and for that the number of possible structurally unique BSTs would be 1. So let\\'s recurse:\\n\\nCode:\\n```\\npublic int numTrees(int n) {\\n        return recur( n );\\n    }\\n    public int recur( int n ) {\\n        if ( n<2 ) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        int res = 0;\\n        for ( int i=n; i>0; i-- ) {\\n            res += recur( i-1 ) * recur( n-i );\\n        }\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nNow recursion would lead to TLE. What to do now? Did you say \"Memoize it!\". Ok so let\\'s memoize it.\\n\\nCode:\\n```\\nInteger[] dp;\\n    public int numTrees(int n) {\\n        dp = new Integer[n+1];\\n        return recur( n );\\n    }\\n    public int recur( int n ) {\\n        if ( n<2 ) {\\n            return 1;\\n        }\\n        if ( dp[n]!=null ) {\\n            return dp[n];\\n        }\\n        int res = 0;\\n        for ( int i=n-1; i>=0; i-- ) {\\n            res += recur( i ) * recur( n-i-1 );\\n        }\\n        return dp[n] = res;\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nAnother interesting solution is using Catalan numbers. So before diving into that lets first understand catalan numbers.\\n```Catalan(n) = Catalan(0)*Catalan(n-1) + Catalan(1)*Catalan(n-2).....+Catalan(i)*Catalan(n-i-1)....+Catalan(n-1)*Catalan(0)```\\nThis is the basic formula for Catalan numbers that can be found using recursion and then memoizing it which would take time complexity of O(n^2). Can we do better? Yes indeed! This whole complex looking expression evaluates to:\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/a032554f-72a1-4064-aa1f-10520edfea6b_1642027916.3883116.png)\\nSo we can calculate this expression in O(n) time with O(1) space.\\n\\nOk, so we get what Catalan numbers are, but how does that help???????\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/e60a16a7-a1f8-4a56-826c-5e1052af290e_1642028210.074719.png)\\nNow look at the expression Catalan(n).

However, we can derive the top-down approach from the brute force solution in a more straightforward way, so that even you may not be aware of using DP in the first place, you still will find that in the middle.\\n\\nTo build a BST from ```[1...n]```, we only need to divide it into three parts: the left subtree, root, and the right subtree.

It\\'s clearly not the best solution (as compared to DP) but I thought it\\'s the easiest to understand and wish to explain the concept behind.**\\n\\nSince we are dealing with BSTs with unique elements, we know that everything in the left sub-tree is less than the root and everything in the right sub-tree is greater than the root. Now, the input given is 1,2,3,...n. So we know there are n nodes and hence when we consider unique BSTs, we know there can be n possible roots. \\n\\nLet\\'s say we pick number i as the root. With the given input, we know that there are i - 1 elements in the left-subtree of the root. (say if I pick 3 as the root, the left subtree can only contain 1 and 2, hence 3 - 1 = 2 elements) As such, in the right-subtree of the chosen root, we know there are n - i elements.\\n\\nSo what is the total number of BSTs with number i as the root? This is given by t(i - 1) * t(n - 1) because the different permutations in the left-subtree and right-subtree are independent events. t is the function of the number of unique BSTs for a given input. \\n\\nNow we know what\\'s the total number of BSTs with number i as the root and we know if the input is n, there can be n possible roots, we thus find the formula to be t(i - 1) * t (n - i) from i = 1 .... to n.\\n\\nLet\\'s convert this to code:\\n```\\n//Recursion using catalan number\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int numTrees(int n) {\\n\\t\\t//this is the base case, when n = 0 we get an empty BST; when n = 1 we get a BST with a root\\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;\\n        int toReturn = 0;\\n\\t\\t//the for-loop below is simply t(i - 1) * t (n - i) from i = 1 .... to n in my explanation\\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n            toReturn += numTrees(i - 1) * numTrees(n - i);\\n        }\\n        return toReturn;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI hope this explanation helps in the understanding of the formula! :) But do note that there are many better solutions out there!",

                "content": "**Explanation**: \\nWe need to define two functions:\\n\\n```G(n)```: the number of unique BST for a sequence of length n.\\n\\n```F(i, n), 1 <= i <= n```: the number of unique BST, where the number i is the root of BST, and the sequence ranges from 1 to n.\\n\\nAs one can see, G(n) is the actual function we need to calculate in order to solve the problem. And G(n) can be derived from F(i, n), which at the end, would recursively refer to G(n).\\n\\nFirst of all, given the above definitions, we can see that the total number of unique BST G(n), is the sum of BST F(i) using each number i as a root.\\ni.e. ```G(n) = F(1, n) + F(2, n) + ... + F(n, n). ```\\n\\nWhenever we have a tree with only 1 root, then we have a only 1 combination possible. So that\\'s why dp[1] = 1. Also we initialize dp[0] = 1, because we are going to get cases where we are going to need dp[0]\\n```\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     G(3)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t/             |            \\\\\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    F(1,3)            F(2,3)        F(3,3)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    /   \\\\              /  \\\\           /  \\\\\\n\\t\\t  \\t        G(0)  G(2)           G(1) G(1)      G(2) G(0)   \\n ```\\nSo the  code is: \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int numTrees(int n) {\\n\\t int[] dp = new int[n + 1];\\n     dp[0] = 1;\\n     dp[1] = 1;\\n        \\n     for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {\\n          for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {\\n                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];\\n            } \\n         }\\n \\n\\treturn dp[n];\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nExample: \\n\\nFor n = 3\\nInitial -> dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1\\n\\n1.

Final answer is 2 which means that we have 2 combinations available for 0 nodes on left and 2 nodes on right. \\n    ii) dp[3] = dp[3] + dp[1]*dp[1] = 2 + 1*1 = 3 <-- We have 1 nodes on the left and 1 nodes on the right.

So the number of unique trees of [2,3] is the same as the number of [1,2].\\nSo by far, it may remind you it\\'s very similar to the structure of Fibonacci number, that we can get the latter number by adding the previous number. Only in this problem, it is to multiply the number of possible left trees with the number of possible right trees. \\nSo just for [1,2,3], let start with a simple loop to see how to put the things together\\n\\n```\\n// For n = 3\\nint count = 0;\\nfor(int i=1; i<=3; i++) {\\n\\xA0 \\xA0// let i be the root node, then the possible number of trees with i being the root is\\n\\xA0 \\xA0int i_count = number of trees from (i-1 nodes) * number of trees from (3-i nodes)\\n\\xA0 \\xA0// add the possible number of trees with i begin the root to count\\n\\xA0 \\xA0count += i_count;\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI believe you\\'ve got the idea of how to extend the simple case of 3 to any number n.\\nThis is also a very classic DP problem that we can\\n1. find the optimal substructure for the problem\\n2. find recurrence between the problem and subproblem\\n\\nThe final solution\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 int numTrees(int n) {\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 vector<int> dp(n+1, 0);\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 dp[0] = 1; \\xA0 // for null tree, it is counted as 1\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 for(int j=1; j<=i; j++) {\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 // for every j as the root node\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 // the number is dp[left]*dp[right]\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 dp[i] += dp[j-1]*dp[i-j];\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 }\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 }\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\n\\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 \\xA0 return dp[n];\\n\\xA0 \\xA0 }\\n};\\n```\\n",

The vector dp will be used to store the number of unique binary search trees for i nodes.\\n\\nInitialize dp[0] and dp[1] to 1 since there is only one way to form binary search trees with 0 and 1 nodes (empty tree and single-node tree).\\n\\nIterate from i = 2 up to n. For each i, calculate the number of unique binary search trees using the Catalan number formula: dp[i] = dp[0] * dp[i - 1] + dp[1] * dp[i - 2] + ... + dp[i - 1] * dp[0]. This calculation is done by considering each element j as the root and multiplying the number of unique binary search trees for the left subtree (with j - 1 nodes) and the right subtree (with i - j nodes).\\n\\nReturn dp[n], which represents the total number of unique binary search trees with n nodes.\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:0(n*n)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:0(n)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\nint solve(int n)\\n{\\n    vector<int>dp(n+1,0);    \\n    dp[0]=dp[1]=1;\\n    for(int i=2;i<=n;i++)\\n    {\\n        for(int j= 1;j<=i;j++)\\n        {\\n            dp[i]+= dp[j-1]*dp[i-j];\\n        }\\n    }\\n        return dp[n];\\n}\\n    int numTrees(int n) {\\n    return solve(n); \\n    }\\n};\\n```",

G(2).\\nSo, we essentially first compute G(2) then G(3), G(4) and etc till G(n)\\n\\nThe outer loop `for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {` is where we point which `G` we want to compute, so we start with G(2), then G(3) ... G(n)\\n\\nThe inner loop `for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {` is actually the place where we compute the pointed G[i] using the formula:\\n$$\\\\mathrm{G(i)} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n G(j - 1) * G(i - j) $$\\n\\nIn other words, due to recursive nature of the formula we have 2 for loops.\\n\\nIt took me a while to realise that.\\nHope it will help someone else!\\n\\n"

G(2).\\nSo, we essentially first compute G(2) then G(3), G(4) and etc till G(n)\\n\\nThe outer loop `for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {` is where we point which `G` we want to compute, so we start with G(2), then G(3) ... G(n)\\n\\nThe inner loop `for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {` is actually the place where we compute the pointed G[i] using the formula:\\n$$\\\\mathrm{G(i)} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n G(j - 1) * G(i - j) $$\\n\\nIn other words, due to recursive nature of the formula we have 2 for loops.\\n\\nIt took me a while to realise that.\\nHope it will help someone else!\\n\\n"

G(2).\\nSo, we essentially first compute G(2) then G(3), G(4) and etc till G(n)\\n\\nThe outer loop `for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {` is where we point which `G` we want to compute, so we start with G(2), then G(3) ... G(n)\\n\\nThe inner loop `for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {` is actually the place where we compute the pointed G[i] using the formula:\\n$$\\\\mathrm{G(i)} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n G(j - 1) * G(i - j) $$\\n\\nIn other words, due to recursive nature of the formula we have 2 for loops.\\n\\nIt took me a while to realise that.\\nHope it will help someone else!\\n\\n"

G(2).\\nSo, we essentially first compute G(2) then G(3), G(4) and etc till G(n)\\n\\nThe outer loop `for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {` is where we point which `G` we want to compute, so we start with G(2), then G(3) ... G(n)\\n\\nThe inner loop `for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {` is actually the place where we compute the pointed G[i] using the formula:\\n$$\\\\mathrm{G(i)} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n G(j - 1) * G(i - j) $$\\n\\nIn other words, due to recursive nature of the formula we have 2 for loops.\\n\\nIt took me a while to realise that.\\nHope it will help someone else!\\n\\n"

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe intuition behind the given query is to delete duplicate records from the \"Person\" table based on the email column, while keeping the record with the minimum ID for each email.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n1. The inner subquery (labeled as \"q\") selects the duplicate email addresses from the \"Person\" table and determines the minimum ID for each email using the min aggregate function and group by clause.\\n2. The outer query deletes the records from the \"Person\" table by joining it with the subquery on two conditions:\\na. Matching email addresses: p.Email = q.Email\\nb. IDs greater than the minimum ID for each email: Id > q.minId\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe time complexity of this query depends on the number of rows in the \"Person\" table and the efficiency of the indexing on the \"Email\" and \"Id\" columns. The subquery with the group by and min aggregate function may have a complexity of O(N log N), where N is the number of rows in the table. The deletion itself can have a complexity of O(N) or O(log N) depending on the indexing and the number of deleted rows.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe space complexity of this query is primarily determined by the memory required to process the subquery and perform the deletion. The subquery may require additional memory to store intermediate results, such as the grouped email addresses and their minimum IDs. The deletion operation itself may require additional memory depending on the database engine\\'s implementation and the transactional context.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n# Please write a DELETE statement and DO NOT write a SELECT statement.\\n# Write your MySQL query statement below\\ndelete p.*\\nfrom Person as P,\\n(\\n    select Email, min(Id) as minId from Person\\n    group by Email having count(*) > 1\\n)\\nas q\\nwhere p.Email = q.Email and Id > q.minId\\n```",

This ensures that the row with the lowest \\'id\\' for each email address will appear first.\\n2. **Delete Duplicate Emails**: We then use the `drop_duplicates()` method with the `subset=\\'email\\'` argument to delete rows with duplicate email addresses. Since the DataFrame is sorted by \\'id\\', the first occurrence of each email (i.e., the one with the lowest \\'id\\') will be kept.\\n3. **In-place Modification**: Both sorting and deletion are performed in place on the original DataFrame, ensuring that the changes are reflected in the calling code.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- **Time complexity**: \\\\(O(n \\\\log n)\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is the number of rows in the DataFrame.

The query selects the records to be deleted and uses the DELETE statement to remove them from the table.\\n\\nThe condition **P1.id > P2.id** ensures that we keep the record with the lowest ID value and delete the duplicates. By comparing the ID values, we retain the earliest or original record while deleting the duplicates that have higher ID values.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n**Time complexity:**\\nThe complexity of this approach depends on the size of the table and the number of duplicate email records. Let\\'s denote n as the number of records in the table. The time complexity of this approach is $$O(n^2)$$ because it involves a self-join operation. However, the actual execution time may vary based on the database engine and indexing.\\n\\n\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n# Please write a DELETE statement and DO NOT write a SELECT statement.\\n# Write your MySQL query statement below\\n\\nDELETE P1 FROM Person P1\\nJOIN Person P2 USING(email)\\nWHERE P1.id>P2.id\\n```\\n\\n***Please Upvote my solution, if you find it helpful ;)***\\n\\n![6a87bc25-d70b-424f-9e60-7da6f345b82a_1673875931.8933976.jpeg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/c693f5cf-ff82-4efb-93c0-c23dfe251020_1685478197.3920174.jpeg)\\n",

The explanation in [the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations][1] is not solid either.\\n\\n **1. Let's start from the 1-dimension case** \\n\\nSuppose we have n people living on a straight street and they want to find somewhere to meet. The total distance is \\n\\n![enter image description here][2]\\n\\nwhere ![enter image description here][3] is the location of each house and ![enter image description here][4]\\nis the meeting point. To minimize this problem, take the derivative of this equation. Each term will give you \\n\\n - 1, if ![enter image description here][5]\\n - -1, if ![enter image description here][6]\\n\\nTo reach the minimum, the derivative must be 0. To make the derivative 0, the number of 1s and -1s must equal. \\n\\n - If n is even, then m must be located between the middle two locations (Any locations between them will give you the minimum, **not necessarily** the median). \\n - If n is odd, then m must be located on the middle one house. That's the median.\\n\\n**2. Then we can discuss the 2-dimension case**\\n\\nLet's write down the equation directly.\\n\\n![enter image description here][7]\\n\\nSo this time, we have two variables - m and n. Recall what you've learned in multiple variables calculus. To find the minimum, we need to take the partial derivatives for the equation. And each partial derivative (or we can say, each dimension) will give you the same result as the 1-D case.\\n\\n**3. So we can even solve the problem in any dimension**\\n\\nBecause every dimension is independent to each other. Do every dimension as 1-D case.\\n\\n\\n  [1]: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/113270/the-median-minimizes-the-sum-of-absolute-deviations\\n  [2]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csum_i%7B%7Cx_i-m%7C%7D\\n  [3]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_i\\n  [4]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m\\n  [5]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m%20%3E%20x_i\\n  [6]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m%20%3C%20x_i\\n  [7]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csum_i%20%7Cx_i-m%7C+%7Cy_i-n%7C"

I will explain why we need to (have to) group the sum in such a form later.\\n\\nUsing triangle inequality, |x-x<sub>i</sub>| + |x-x<sub>N+1-i</sub>| >= |x<sub>N+1-i</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>| = x<sub>N+1-i</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>, and the fact N%2 >= 0, so we can find a lower bound for f\\n* f(x) >= &Sigma;<sub>i=1:N/2</sub> (x<sub>N+1-i</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>),\\n\\nwhich means if we could actually pick an x to achieve this value, we find the optimal x!\\n\\nActually, inequality |x-x<sub>i</sub>| + |x-x<sub>N+1-i</sub>| >= |x<sub>N+1-i</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>| achieves equality if and only if x is in [x<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>N+1-i</sub>]. Since {x<sub>i=1:N</sub>} is increasing, closed interval sequence { [x<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>N+1-i</sub>] }<sub>i=1:N/2</sub> is nested, and so they have non-empty common intersection [x<sub>N/2</sub>, x<sub>N-N/2+1</sub>]. This is critical, and this is why we need to design the grouping like this. Now it is trivial to see that picking any value in the intersection [x<sub>N/2</sub>, x<sub>N-N/2+1</sub>] will reach the minimum if N is even, and only x = x<sub>N/2+1</sub> can reach the minimum if N is odd (since we also have to make |x-x<sub>N/2+1</sub>| zero)."

The explanation in [the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations][1] is not solid either.\\n\\n **1. Let's start from the 1-dimension case** \\n\\nSuppose we have n people living on a straight street and they want to find somewhere to meet. The total distance is \\n\\n![enter image description here][2]\\n\\nwhere ![enter image description here][3] is the location of each house and ![enter image description here][4]\\nis the meeting point. To minimize this problem, take the derivative of this equation. Each term will give you \\n\\n - 1, if ![enter image description here][5]\\n - -1, if ![enter image description here][6]\\n\\nTo reach the minimum, the derivative must be 0. To make the derivative 0, the number of 1s and -1s must equal. \\n\\n - If n is even, then m must be located between the middle two locations (Any locations between them will give you the minimum, **not necessarily** the median). \\n - If n is odd, then m must be located on the middle one house. That's the median.\\n\\n**2. Then we can discuss the 2-dimension case**\\n\\nLet's write down the equation directly.\\n\\n![enter image description here][7]\\n\\nSo this time, we have two variables - m and n. Recall what you've learned in multiple variables calculus. To find the minimum, we need to take the partial derivatives for the equation. And each partial derivative (or we can say, each dimension) will give you the same result as the 1-D case.\\n\\n**3. So we can even solve the problem in any dimension**\\n\\nBecause every dimension is independent to each other. Do every dimension as 1-D case.\\n\\n\\n  [1]: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/113270/the-median-minimizes-the-sum-of-absolute-deviations\\n  [2]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csum_i%7B%7Cx_i-m%7C%7D\\n  [3]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_i\\n  [4]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m\\n  [5]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m%20%3E%20x_i\\n  [6]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m%20%3C%20x_i\\n  [7]: https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csum_i%20%7Cx_i-m%7C+%7Cy_i-n%7C"

I will explain why we need to (have to) group the sum in such a form later.\\n\\nUsing triangle inequality, |x-x<sub>i</sub>| + |x-x<sub>N+1-i</sub>| >= |x<sub>N+1-i</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>| = x<sub>N+1-i</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>, and the fact N%2 >= 0, so we can find a lower bound for f\\n* f(x) >= &Sigma;<sub>i=1:N/2</sub> (x<sub>N+1-i</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>),\\n\\nwhich means if we could actually pick an x to achieve this value, we find the optimal x!\\n\\nActually, inequality |x-x<sub>i</sub>| + |x-x<sub>N+1-i</sub>| >= |x<sub>N+1-i</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>| achieves equality if and only if x is in [x<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>N+1-i</sub>]. Since {x<sub>i=1:N</sub>} is increasing, closed interval sequence { [x<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>N+1-i</sub>] }<sub>i=1:N/2</sub> is nested, and so they have non-empty common intersection [x<sub>N/2</sub>, x<sub>N-N/2+1</sub>]. This is critical, and this is why we need to design the grouping like this. Now it is trivial to see that picking any value in the intersection [x<sub>N/2</sub>, x<sub>N-N/2+1</sub>] will reach the minimum if N is even, and only x = x<sub>N/2+1</sub> can reach the minimum if N is odd (since we also have to make |x-x<sub>N/2+1</sub>| zero)."

I have re - wirtten the two lines of above example into a intuitive format. **The last number is to be multiplied with zero.**\\n```\\nF(0) = 4 * 0 + 5 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 2 * 3 + 9 * 4 = 53\\nF(1) = 4 * 1 + 5 * 2 + 3 * 3 + 2 * 4 + 9 * 0 = 31\\n\\n```\\n\\nSo now to achieve this without looping through the entire array, we can follow the steps given below:\\n(Defining the O(n) algorithm)\\n\\n1. Calculate the sum of the entire array. Lets call if arr_sum\\n2. Calculate the F(0) by finding the sum of product of array_val * index. Lets call is it sum_of_products.\\n3. Now the interesting part, to calculate F(1) from sum_of_products (which is F(0) ), \\n\\ti) Perform sum_of_products + arr_sum. (This setp is equivallent to incrementing the multiplier of all the values in the array).\\n\\tii) Now from the **partial sum** subtract the **last_val * n** (where n is the length of the array). The last element in F(0) is supposed to be multiplied by 0. However in the step i) we essentially increased the multipliers of all array value. So the partial sum reflects the **last element * n**\\n\\n4.

                "content": "Initially, I tried to solve this question using 2 loops i.e. in O(N^2) approach but instead of expecting TLE got WA and I still not able to get why i got that. Nevertheless, that approach would not have worked though. So, I then tried it solving in O(n) and then using an example, started recognising a pattern in each rotation(did not actually rotate the array though). Lets discuss through an example:\\n\\nLet a=[4,3,2,6]. \\nAt k=0(no rotation) ->  I precomputed its answer and it comes out to be 25. Also i precomputed the sum of the array. 0*4 + 1*3 + 2*2 + 3*6 = 25\\nAt k=1(rotated by 1 unit clockwise). Now our array becomes(just imagine) a=[6,4,3,2]. Now if we closely look, we can see the last element i.e. would now contribute 0 to our answer unlike earlier it contributed (n-1) times. So for this rotation we have to subtract that and we have to add contribution of all the other elements as we can see, now all the other elements contribute 1 time extra prior to the prev ans. i.e. 0*6 + 1*4 + 2*3 + 3*2 = 16\\nNow we can make  a formula out of it F(1) = F(0) - ((n-1)*(a[index])) + (sum - a[index])  where index=n-1.\\nWe now decrement index by 1. It is very crucial because we are not actually rotating our array and so when we now rotate the original array by 2 or prev array by 1 clockwise we will get [2,6,4,3] and now 2 needs to be subtracted (n-1) times from prev answer and other elements need to be added as in the original array [4 3 2 6] 2 comes at 2 position which we will get only if we do index--...\\n# Below is the code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    long long int maxRotateFunction(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n=nums.size();\\n        int sum=0;\\n        int ans=0;\\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\\n            sum+=nums[i];\\n            ans += i*nums[i];\\n        }\\n        int index=n-1;\\n        int res=ans;\\n        for(int k=1;k<n;k++){\\n            ans = ans - ((n-1)*nums[index]) + (sum-nums[index]);\\n            res=max(res,ans);\\n            index--;\\n        }\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Calculate the initial value of F(0) using a loop that iterates through the array and multiplies each element by its index, then add all the products.

Calculate the new value of F(i) by subtracting the sum of all elements from the last element, then add (n-1) times the last element. The formula is: F(i) = F(i-1) + total_sum - n * nums[n-i]\\nb.

Return the value of \"max_sum\".\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the solution involves a single iteration through the input array to calculate the initial value of F(0), and then another iteration through the array to calculate the remaining values of F(i). The time complexity of each iteration is O(n), since we need to perform n multiplication and addition operations for each element in the array.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity of this solution is O(1), since we only need to store a constant number of variables regardless of the size of the input array. Specifically, we need to store the length of the input array (n), the total sum of all elements in the array (total_sum), the current value of F(i) (current_sum), and the maximum value of F(i) seen so far (max_sum).\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxRotateFunction(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        n = len(nums)\\n        total_sum = sum(nums)  # Calculate the sum of all elements in the array\\n        \\n        current_sum = sum(i * nums[i] for i in range(n))  # Calculate the initial value of F(0)\\n        max_sum = current_sum\\n        \\n        # Iterate through the array starting from index 1 to n-1\\n        for i in range(1, n):\\n            current_sum += total_sum - n * nums[n-i]  # Calculate the new value of F(i)\\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)  # Update the max_sum variable if necessary\\n            \\n        return max_sum\\n\\n```",

                "content": "This is my first post so be nice. We\\'re dealing with a simple function that operates on our array. At first glance, the easiest way to solve this would be to brute force it, computing every single `F(i) for i in len(nums)` and taking the maximum. This would take `O(n^2)` time (where `n` is the length of the given array `nums`) as each computation of `F` takes linear time and we are computing the output once for possible number of rotations we can perform. Can we do better than this? \\n\\nThe key to finding a better solution is to re-use work that we have already done. It would be possible to improve the runtime if we could somehow compute the answer using answers that we have previously computed. We, in fact, can do this. Let\\'s look at the given example and see if we can see a pattern: \\n```\\nnums = [4,3,2,6]\\nF(0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25\\nF(1) = (0 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\\nF(2) = (0 * 2) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23\\nF(3) = (0 * 3) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26\\n```\\nIf we look at the entires of the calculations diagonally, we see that in each step going down, each element of the array gets added to the sum one more time and the last element is completely subtracted `n-1` times (where `n=len(nums)`). Then, for any valid `i>0 `, we have the relation: `F(i) = F(i-1) + sum(nums) - n * nums[-i])` where `nums[-i]` is the ith entry of the array from the back, 1-indexed. Note that we add the sum each time and subtract `n` times to simplify the calculation. Piecing this all together, we have the following code in Python: \\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxRotateFunction(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        cur = sum(i*n for i,n in enumerate(nums))\\n        max_ans = cur\\n        nums_sum = sum(nums)\\n        l = len(nums)\\n        for i in range(len(nums)-1,0,-1):\\n            cur -= (l * nums[i])\\n            cur += nums_sum\\n            max_ans = max(max_ans, cur)\\n        return max_ans\\n```\\nThe runtime of this function is `O(n)` since calculating the initial sum takes linear time and each step through a rotation takes `O(1)` time with exactly `(n-1)` steps. The space used is `O(1)` since the maximum sum, length of the array and current sum are all constant space with respect to the length `num`.",

Since we are finding the max sum, we eventually need to doing a loop compute the sum of all combination (This )\\n 2.  According to the example: ```nums = [4, 3, 2, 6]```\\n   - ```F(0) => ([4, 3, 2, 6]) = (0) * 4 + (1) * 3 + (2) * 2  + (3) * 6 ```\\n   - ```F(1) => ([6, 4, 3, 2]) = (1) * 4 + (2) * 3 + (3) * 2  + (0) * 6 ```\\n   - ```F(2) => ([2, 6, 4, 3]) = (2) * 4 + (3) * 3 + (0) * 2  + (1) * 6 ```\\n   - ```F(3) => ([3, 2, 6, 4]) = (3) * 4 + (0) * 3 + (1) * 2  + (2) * 6 ```\\n   - I reorder the terms from the example. It turned out that, each time we rotate the list, the new sum is subtracted by (n-1)*(last element), and added by sum of the rest. i.e. ```F(1)=F(0)-(3)*6+(1)*4+(1)*3+(1)*2```\\n  3. At this point, this question became pretty straightforward: we don\\'t really need to rotate the list, but keep track of the \\'right most element\\' and do the the calculation.\\n```\\ndef maxRotateFunction(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n\\t\\t# calculating F(0):\\n        curr_sum = sum([x*i for i, x in enumerate(nums)])\\n        curr_max = curr_sum\\n        n = len(nums)\\n\\t\\t# Index of right-most element\\n        r = n-1\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t# This stores the sum of left subset (entire list excluding right-most element)\\n        left_subset = sum(nums)-nums[r]\\n        \\n        \\n        for i in range(n):\\n\\t\\t\\t# F(i) = F(i) + 1*left_sum - (n-1)*right_element\\n            curr_sum += left_subset\\n            curr_sum -= nums[r]*(n-1)\\n            \\n\\t\\t\\t# After that, we \\'rotate\\' the list, right-most element go to front\\n\\t\\t\\t# and update the sum of left subset\\n            left_subset = left_subset + nums[r] - nums[r-1]\\n            r -= 1\\n            \\n            curr_max = max(curr_max, curr_sum)\\n            \\n        return curr_max\\n```",
