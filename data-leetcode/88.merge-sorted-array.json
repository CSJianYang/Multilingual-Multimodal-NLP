We need to merge these two arrays into a single sorted array, and the result should be stored inside nums1. Since nums1 is of size m+n, we can use this extra space to store the merged array. We can iterate through the arrays from the end and place the larger element in the end of nums1.\\n\\n---\\n# Approach : ***Using STL***\\n1.

We will also have another pointer k initialized to m+n-1, which will be used to keep track of the position in nums1 where we will be placing the larger element. Then we can start iterating from the end of the arrays i and j, and compare the elements at these positions. We will place the larger element in nums1 at position k, and decrement the corresponding pointer i or j accordingly. We will continue doing this until we have iterated through all the elements in nums2.

                "content": "### Logic\\nWe\\'d like to attempt this question in-place because all the space we need is already provided by our first array; there\\'s no need to create extra space. We\\'d like to use a two-pointer approach but it can get quite messy dealing with certain cases. Since our extra space starts at the end of the first array, let\\'s see if we can do this by iterating backwards! \\n\\n**Three Pointers:**\\nLet\\'s use three pointers for this operation:\\n* The main pointer, `i`, will be starting from the end of the first array and will work its way to index 0.\\n* The pointer for the first array, `a`, and;\\n* The pointer for the second array, `b`, will be used for comparing the two sorted arrays and deciding what value to place at `i` next.\\n\\nWe\\'ll decide which value at index `a` or `b` is larger, place that value at index `i`, and decrement either `a` or `b` depending on which was larger. This sounds a bit confusing so I\\'ve illustrated below how this would work with two example arrays:\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/c677fb0a-96f3-4738-bbfa-28f6b4e3e97e_1654564101.5492318.png)\\n\\nI hope the above illustration sufficiently details the three pointer approach. In summary, we compare two values, pick the larger one, and move to the next comparison. The reason we move the pointer of the larger value is because we already know that that number is larger than (or equal to) ANY number that comes before it. So we can confidently place it at `i` and move on.\\n___\\n### But won\\'t some values at array A be overridden by the main pointer?\\nGood question! Yes you\\'re right; our `i` pointer will eventually land at values of `A` that are non-zero. Is this a problem? Turns out it isn\\'t. This is because we\\'re guaranteed to have already used those values at `A` before they become overridden. Think about it like this:\\n\\n`A` is of length `m+n`. All our meaningful values are the first `m` values. This means that the last `n` values are empty. Therefore, our `i` pointer needs to process the `nth` largest numbers in both arrays before overriding values at `A`. It\\'s not possible for `i` to override any unused values of `A` by the time it reaches `A`. \\n\\nLet\\'s consider the two extremes:\\n* If the `nth` largest values are all at `A`, our pointer `a` pointer will be moving with `i` so there\\'s no issues there. \\n* If the `nth` largest values are all at `B`, then our `b` pointer will trigger our exit condition \"`b >= 0`\" since our `b` pointer would be negative eventually. Therefore, `i` won\\'t get a chance to override values at `A`. \\n \\nIf this all sounds a bit confusing, don\\'t worry about it! Took me a while to get this explanation in order and if your interviewer expects you to spit this out in an interview, they don\\'t want to hire you haha.  \\n___\\n### Code\\nJust for clarity, the for loop initialises all three pointers and it maintains the `b >= 0` condition that\\'s necessary for our algorithm as aforementioned.\\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or improvements, feel free to let me know.

I\\'ll continue this process until all elements from nums2 are merged into nums1.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(m + n)\\n  The algorithm iterates through both arrays once, where \\'m\\' is the length of nums1 and \\'n\\' is the length of nums2.\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1)\\n  The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables, so the space complexity is constant.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n   public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {\\n        int p1 = m - 1;\\n        int p2 = n - 1;\\n        int pMerge = m + n - 1;\\n        \\n        while (p2 >= 0) {\\n            if (p1 >= 0 && nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]) {\\n                nums1[pMerge--] = nums1[p1--];\\n            } else {\\n                nums1[pMerge--] = nums2[p2--];\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n![c0504eaf-5fb8-4a1d-a769-833262d1b86e_1674433591.3836212.webp](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/8a3b41d1-f0ca-472f-a9f7-8346b34a824e_1693297402.2918687.webp)",

And at last check if  some emlement is left in second array then push that also.\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nTwo pointer can used here by keeping pointers from back and keep decrementing our pointers and keep adding the larger elements in back.\\nNOTE: Since arr1 can accomadate all the elemnts but m is given without zeroes counting so take care of that i.e take `k=m+n-1`\\n**Some confusion that can occur: Why we check if arr2 is empty why not arr1**\\nSince we have to fill the  first array so we only need to cover the second array because if second will be empty we can directly return our first one as its but if first one is empty we have to move second array in first and then return. Since first can\\'t be actually empty but m is given without zeroes counting so when m=0 we might take that as empty so just traverse second wholely. And check the pointer of first array if it has gone to end still there might be some elemnts in arr2.But when pointer of arr2 has gone to end we don\\'t need any comparsion then juut keep the remnaing elemnts as it is .\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:O(N+M)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n**Biginer Friendly Code but SPACE is $$O(N)$$**\\n```\\nvoid merge(vector<int>& arr, int m, vector<int>& arr2, int n) {\\n        int i=0,j=0;\\n        vector<int>v(m+n);\\n        int k=0;\\n        while(i<m and j<n){\\n            \\n           if(arr[i]<arr2[j])v[k++]=arr[i],i++;\\n           else {\\n               v[k++]=arr2[j],j++;\\n           }\\n        }\\n        while(i<m)v[k++]=arr[i++];\\n          while(j<n)v[k++]=arr2[j++];\\n        \\n        for(int i=0;i<m+n;i++)arr[i]=v[i];\\n    }\\n```\\n**Actual Code with O(1) SPACE**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void merge(vector<int>& arr, int m, vector<int>& arr2, int n) {\\n      int i=m-1,j=n-1;\\n      int k=m+n-1;\\n      while(j>=0 and i>=0){\\n          if(arr[i]<arr2[j])arr[k--]=arr2[j--];\\n          else arr[k--]=arr[i--];\\n      }\\n      while(j>=0)arr[k--]=arr2[j--];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n****ONE LINER with same logic only simpler implementation****\\n```\\n void merge(vector<int>& arr, int m, vector<int>& arr2, int n) {\\n      int i=m-1,j=n-1,k=m+n-1;\\n      while(j>=0 ){\\n         arr[k--]=(i<0 || arr[i]<arr2[j])?arr2[j--]:arr[i--];\\n      }\\n    }\\n```",

Also, we need to start from **end** of our lists, and this is essential, if you start from the beginning of lists, you can accidentely rewrite you data, so you need to think where to put it first and it will be extra space.\\n\\nSo, all we do is:\\n1. define `p1 = m - 1` and `p2 = n - 1`: pointers for `nums1` and `nums2`.\\n2. We start from `i = m + n - 1` and move in backward direction: we compare `nums1[p1]` and `nums2[p2]`, write biggest number to `nums1[i]` and move one of the pointers: `p1` or `p2`.\\n3. This is not all: it can happen, that when we reached `p1 = 0`, there are still some numbers we need to copy from `nums2` to `nums1`, and in next step we do this.\\n\\n**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n + m)`, space complexity is `O(1)`: we did everything inplace.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):\\n        p1, p2 = m - 1, n - 1\\n        for i in range(m+n-1, -1, -1):\\n            if p1 < 0 or p2 < 0: break\\n            if nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:\\n                nums1[i] = nums1[p1]\\n                p1 -= 1\\n            else:\\n                nums1[i] = nums2[p2]\\n                p2 -= 1\\n              \\n        while p2 >= 0:\\n            nums1[i] = nums2[p2]\\n            i -= 1\\n            p2 -= 1\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Make a copy of nums1, and then step through the nums1 copy and nums2, from the front, adding whichever is smallest back into nums1.\\n\\nThis obviously will increase memory use, but produces 52ms runtime (i.e 100%).\\n\\n```\\nvar merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {\\n    \\n    if (n == 0) return;\\n    \\n    let nums1copy = [...nums1], mm = 0, nn = 0;\\n    \\n    for (let i = 0; i < (m+n); i++) {\\n        //Is it smaller, or have we run out of the second list?\\n        if ( (nums1copy[mm] < nums2[nn] && mm < m) || nn >= n ) {\\n            nums1[i] = nums1copy[mm];\\n            mm++;\\n        } else {\\n            nums1[i] = nums2[nn];\\n            nn++;\\n        }   \\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Method 3**\\n\\nThis method uses no additional memory and retains the 52ms (100%) runtime.\\n\\nThe biggest problem with starting from the front, is that you run into trouble with overwriting values etc. and it likely won\\'t work.\\n\\nThis method starts from the back - where our \"empty\" spaces are. Similar to method 2, we are basically keeping two pointers, but starting at the back and looking for the bigger of the two numbers instead of the smaller.\\n\\nThe code would be a lot more legible if we simply \"let i = m + n\" but I quite liked the zero memory consumption of this approach.\\n\\n```\\nvar merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {\\n    //we don\\'t want the length, we want the start position of the final elements\\n    m--;\\n    n--;\\n    \\n    while (m + n >= -1) {\\n        //If bigger, or nothing left in nums2, copy it over\\n        if ( (nums1[m] > nums2[n] ) || n < 0) {\\n            nums1[m + n + 1] = nums1[m];\\n            m--;\\n        } else {\\n            nums1[m + n + 1] = nums2[n];\\n            n--;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n",

Is that a good idea? The only way to know for sure is to profile on the hardware of interest, but short of that, we can take a look at the assembly generated by the compiler. Here\\'s that loop again:\\n\\n```c++\\nwhile(n >= 0 && m >= 0){\\n\\tconst int num1 = nums1[m];\\n\\tconst int num2 = nums2[n];\\n\\tnums1[write] = std::max(num1, num2);\\n\\tif(num1 > num2){\\n\\t\\t--m;\\n\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t--n;\\n\\t}\\n\\t--write;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis was an attempt to keep the code inside the branch as short as possible. Let\\'s use Godbolt to see what a compiler (clang trunk in this case) does with that:\\n\\n```\\n.LBB0_2: # =>This Inner Loop Header: Depth=1\\n  movsxd rsi, esi\\n  mov ebp, dword ptr [r9 + 4*rsi]\\n  movsxd rcx, ecx\\n  mov ebx, dword ptr [r8 + 4*rcx]\\n  xor r10d, r10d\\n  xor eax, eax\\n  cmp ebp, ebx\\n  cmovl ebp, ebx\\n  mov ebx, r15d\\n  mov dword ptr [r9 + 4*rbx], ebp\\n  setle r10b\\n  setg al\\n  sub esi, eax\\n  sub ecx, r10d\\n  dec r15d\\n  mov eax, ecx\\n  or eax, esi\\n  jns .LBB0_2\\n```\\n\\nCool, the `std::max` becomes a conditional move:\\n\\n```\\n  cmp ebp, ebx\\n  cmovl ebp, ebx\\n  mov ebx, r15d\\n  mov dword ptr [r9 + 4*rbx], ebp\\n  ```\\n  Going into this, register ebp contains `nums1[m]` and ebx `nums2[n]`. The two registers are compared, one is conditionally moved on top of the other, and then that is written out to memory, all without a branch.\\n\\nNow we have a very simple branch at the source level to update either `m` or `n`:\\n\\n```c++\\nif(num1 > num2){\\n\\t--m;\\n} else {\\n\\t--n;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet\\'s look at what code that generates:\\n\\n```\\n  setle r10b\\n  setg al\\n  sub esi, eax\\n  sub ecx, r10d\\n```\\nAs we go into this, the processor condition codes still reflect the earlier `cmp ebp, ebx` which we used to find the ordering betwen the elements of the two arrays. Now we use the codes again for the two conditional set instructions, `setle` (_set if less than or equal_) and `setg` (_set if greater than_). This gives us either a 0 in register 10 and a 1 in register al, or a 1 in register 10 and a 0 register al. The next two lines then subtract either a 0 or a 1 from the registers holding the values of m and n without any branches being used. \\n\\nNow we can consider what code is generated with the more straightforward formulation of the same loop, not using `std::max` and instead having just a single extra line on each side of the `if` statement. \\n\\n```c++\\nwhile(n >= 0 && m >= 0){\\n\\tconst int num1 = nums1[m];\\n\\tconst int num2 = nums2[n];\\n\\tif(num1 > num2){\\n\\t\\tnums1[write] = num1;\\n\\t\\t--m;\\n\\t} else {\\n\\t\\tnums1[write] = num2;\\n\\t\\t--n;\\n\\t}\\n\\t--write;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the dissassembly below, we jump into it at label `.LBB1_2`. The body of the loop then features a branch `jle` for our `if` statement and a control flow which bounces around a lot more.\\n\\n```\\n.LBB1_22: # in Loop: Header=BB1_2 Depth=1\\n  mov dword ptr [r9 + 4*rax], ecx\\n  dec r10d\\n.LBB1_23: # in Loop: Header=BB1_2 Depth=1\\n  dec eax\\n  mov ecx, esi\\n  or ecx, r10d\\n  js .LBB1_4\\n.LBB1_2: # =>This Inner Loop Header: Depth=1 <----- We enter here from a jump not shown.\\n  movsxd rcx, esi\\n  mov ebx, dword ptr [r9 + 4*rcx]\\n  movsxd rcx, r10d\\n  mov ecx, dword ptr [r8 + 4*rcx]\\n  mov eax, eax\\n  cmp ebx, ecx\\n  jle .LBB1_22\\n  mov dword ptr [r9 + 4*rax], ebx\\n  dec esi\\n  jmp .LBB1_23\\n.LBB1_4:    # Go on to the cleanup loop ...\\n```\\n\\nThis is just the result of one compiler with a particular set of flags. Which of these two is actually faster is still not certain. \\n\\nFull assembly listing on Godbolt [here](https://godbolt.org/z/XqEH9-).\\n",

                "content": "This is not my solution.  It\\'s a tweak of the solution in _Cracking the Code Interview_. But I wanted to share it, since it\\'s clever and I didn\\'t see it mentioned in the top discussions. Everything I saw had more than 2 conditionals or loops, or ternaries that made the solution harder to read.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works.  Instead of starting at the beginning, then having to shift the array over when you\\'ve inserted into the first array, work backwards.  Start at the end of both arrays, you know that the biggest of these two must be the last one in the merged array, so replace the (empty) spot at the end of the merged array, then move your indexes to the left and repeat. Also, keep an index on the current spot to insert at.  Eventually you\\'ll run out of empty spots, and start overwriting spots in `nums1`.  This is OK though, because at the point this happens, all the elements that are bigger than the index at which you\\'re inserting area already present in the array where there used to be empty space!\\n\\nHere\\'s what it looks like at the point we start overwriting values in the first array\\na = 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6\\nb = 1, 2, 6\\naPointer = 3 (index 0)\\nbPointer = 2 (index 1)\\ninsertAt = the first 5 (index 2)\\n\\nThen, we start replacing, and the first replacement will actually be from `a` itself, since it\\'s the next biggest\\na = 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6\\nb = 1, 2, 6\\naPointer = null (index -1)\\nbPointer = 2 (index 1)\\ninsertAt = the first 4 (index 1)\\n\\nThen all that\\'s left is the last 2 (`1` and `2`) from `b`, which replace the first `3` and `4`, giving us the final result.\\na = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\nb = 1, 2, 6\\naPointer = null (index -1)\\nbPointer = null (index -1)\\ninsertAt = null (index -1)\\n\\n```\\npublic void merge(int[] a, int aLength, int[] b, int bLength) {\\n    int aIndex = aLength - 1;  // initialize to the end of a, not including empty space\\n    int bIndex = bLength - 1;  // initialize to end of b\\n    int insertAt = aLength + bLength - 1;  // initialize to end of a, including empty space\\n    while (bIndex >= 0)  // looping over b, because once we\\'re out of b\\'s, the a\\'s remaining are already sorted (since input is sorted)\\n        if (aIndex >= 0 && a[aIndex] >= b[bIndex])  // a >= b\\n            a[insertAt--] = a[aIndex--];  // insert value from a, then shift indexes for a and insert\\n        else  // b < a\\n            a[insertAt--] = b[bIndex--];  // insert value from b, then shift indexes for b and insert\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Analysis**\\n**Time:**\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Worst Case:** O(m + n), we iterate over each of m and n once.\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Best Case:** O(n), we insert b\\'s into a, and they all happen to fit exactly at the end.\\n**Memory:** O(1)\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We introduce 3 variables.

It converts it into an awesome question!\\n\\nThe key idea is to start from the end of the arrays rather than the start. The problem with starting at the start is that we\\'d need to use extra memory (or maintain a circular array in the start of nums2... that is an option I think!).\\n\\nThen, we just keep track of our current reading point in each array, and the current point we are writing into.

This is simple enough; at each index ```i```, we can check the values of ```nums1[m-1]``` and ```nums2[n-1]``` and store the larger one into ```nums[i]```.\\n\\nWhile performing this operation, we need to be aware of edge cases:\\n\\n- If ```n == 0```, we\\'ve successfully merged ```nums2``` into ```nums1```. Hence, we can return straightaway since there is nothing more to be done.\\n- If ```m == 0```, we are only left with ```nums2``` elements to fix. Since we started with largest elements first, we can guarantee that the remaining ```k``` elements in ```nums2``` (where ```k <= n```) are smaller than the rest of the elements we\\'ve previously fixed. Then, since these ```k``` elements are already sorted, **we can insert ```nums2``` at the front of ```nums1``` instantly and be done with the merging**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Code\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:\\n        while m > 0 and n > 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t# Index to append to: len(nums1)-1 = m+n-1\\n            if nums1[m-1] > nums2[n-1]:\\n                nums1[m+n-1] = nums1[m-1]\\n                m -= 1  # Check the next element in nums1\\n            else:\\n                nums1[m+n-1] = nums2[n-1]\\n                n -= 1  # Check the next element in nums2\\n\\t\\t# The remaining k elements in nums2 can just be inserted into the front\\n\\t\\t# If k == 0, nums2 has already been merged, so this for loop is also skipped\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            nums1[i] = nums2[i]\\n\\t\\t# nums1[:n] = nums2[:n]  # one-liner\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Final Result\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/67c4722c-04f8-431f-bfed-74308e153b00_1635134680.1653547.png)\\n\\nPlease upvote if this has helped you!

                "content": "# Intuition:\\nThe problem requires merging two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, into `nums1`. To solve this, we can start from the end of the two arrays and compare the elements. We place the larger element at the end of `nums1` and continue this process until we reach the beginning of either array.\\n\\n# Approach 1:\\n1. Initialize a variable `n2` to store the value of `n`.\\n2. Iterate `i` from 0 to `n` (exclusive).\\n    a. Assign `nums2[n2-1]` to `nums1[m+i]` to merge the elements from `nums2` to `nums1`.\\n    b. Check if `n2` is less than or equal to 0. If true, return from the function.\\n    c. Decrement `n2` by 1.\\n3. Sort `nums1` using the `sort` function to ensure the merged array is sorted.\\n\\n# Complexity Analysis:\\n- Time Complexity: The time complexity of this approach is O((m+n)log(m+n)), where m and n are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. This is because we perform a sort operation on `nums1` after merging.\\n- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional space that grows with the input size. We are performing the merge operation in-place.\\n# Code: \\n\\n### C++\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {\\n        int n2 = n;\\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\\n            nums1[(m+i)]=nums2[n2-1];\\n            while(n2<0){\\n            return;\\n            }\\n            n2--;\\n        }\\n        sort(nums1.begin(),nums1.end());\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n### Java\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {\\n        int n2 = n;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            nums1[m + i] = nums2[n2 - 1];\\n            while (n2 < 0) {\\n                return;\\n            }\\n            n2--;\\n        }\\n        Arrays.sort(nums1);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n### Python\\n```py\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):\\n        n2 = n\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            nums1[m + i] = nums2[n2 - 1]\\n            while n2 < 0:\\n                return\\n            n2 -= 1\\n        nums1.sort()\\n\\n```\\n### JavaScript\\n```js\\nvar merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {\\n    let n2 = n;\\n    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n        nums1[m + i] = nums2[n2 - 1];\\n        while (n2 < 0) {\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        n2--;\\n    }\\n    nums1.sort((a, b) => a - b);\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Optimized Approach:\\n1. We start from the end of both `nums1` and `nums2` arrays and compare the elements.\\n2. We have three pointers: `i`, `j`, and `k`. `i` points to the last element in `nums1`, `j` points to the last element in `nums2`, and `k` points to the last position in the merged array.\\n3. While `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to 0, we compare `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`. We place the larger element at `nums1[k]` and decrement the corresponding pointers (`i`, `j`, and `k`).\\n4. After the above loop, if there are any remaining elements in `nums2`, they should be copied to `nums1` starting from position `k` downwards.\\n5. The merged array in `nums1` is now sorted and contains all the elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.\\n\\n# Optimized Complexity:\\n- Time Complexity: The optimized approach has a time complexity of O(m + n) since we perform a linear scan through both `nums1` and `nums2`.\\n- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as we are performing the merge in-place without using any additional data structures.\\n\\n# Code:\\n\\n### C++\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {\\n        int i = m - 1;  // Index of last element in nums1\\n        int j = n - 1;  // Index of last element in nums2\\n        int k = m + n - 1;  // Index of last element in the merged array\\n\\n        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {\\n            if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {\\n                nums1[k] = nums1[i];\\n                i--;\\n            } else {\\n                nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n                j--;\\n            }\\n            k--;\\n        }\\n\\n        // If there are any remaining elements in nums2, they should be copied to nums1\\n        while (j >= 0) {\\n            nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n            j--;\\n            k--;\\n        }\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n### Java\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {\\n        int i = m - 1;  // Index of last element in nums1\\n        int j = n - 1;  // Index of last element in nums2\\n        int k = m + n - 1;  // Index of last element in the merged array\\n\\n        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {\\n            if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {\\n                nums1[k] = nums1[i];\\n                i--;\\n            } else {\\n                nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n                j--;\\n            }\\n            k--;\\n        }\\n\\n        // If there are any remaining elements in nums2, they should be copied to nums1\\n        while (j >= 0) {\\n            nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n            j--;\\n            k--;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n### Python\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):\\n        i = m - 1  # Index of last element in nums1\\n        j = n - 1  # Index of last element in nums2\\n        k = m + n - 1  # Index of last element in the merged array\\n\\n        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\\n            if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:\\n                nums1[k] = nums1[i]\\n                i -= 1\\n            else:\\n                nums1[k] = nums2[j]\\n                j -= 1\\n            k -= 1\\n\\n        # If there are any remaining elements in nums2, they should be copied to nums1\\n        while j >= 0:\\n            nums1[k] = nums2[j]\\n            j -= 1\\n            k -= 1\\n\\n```\\n### JavaScript\\n```\\nvar merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {\\n    let i = m - 1;  // Index of last element in nums1\\n    let j = n - 1;  // Index of last element in nums2\\n    let k = m + n - 1;  // Index of last element in the merged array\\n\\n    while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {\\n        if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {\\n            nums1[k] = nums1[i];\\n            i--;\\n        } else {\\n            nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n            j--;\\n        }\\n        k--;\\n    }\\n\\n    // If there are any remaining elements in nums2, they should be copied to nums1\\n    while (j >= 0) {\\n        nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n        j--;\\n        k--;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```",

Starting from the end of both arrays, we compare the last elements of nums1 and nums2, and place the larger element at the end of nums1. We continue this process until we have merged all the elements of nums1 and nums2.**\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n\\n# Approach for this Problem :\\n1. Set indices i, j, and k to m - 1, n - 1, and nums1.size() - 1, respectively.\\n2. While j is greater than or equal to 0, do the following:\\n    - a. If i is greater than or equal to 0 and the element at index i in nums1 is less than or equal to the element at index j in nums2, set the element at index k in nums1 to the element at index j in nums2 and decrement j.\\n    - b.

If they let you, go ahead.\\n\\nThis is the implementation:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type nums1: List[int]\\n        :type m: int\\n        :type nums2: List[int]\\n        :type n: int\\n        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        nums1[:] = sorted(nums1[:m] + nums2[:n])\\n```\\n\\nWhat it does is that slices the array that you want to store it and it will sort both `nums1` and `nums2` with their sizes (`m` and `n`). Thus, will return you the elements from the sorted array and size of it into `nums1[:]`.\\n\\nHope this helps :)",

The larger element is placed at the end of `nums1`, and the respective counter (i or j) is decremented. The loop continues until either `nums1` or `nums2` has been completely merged into `nums1`.\\n\\nAfter this initial merge, if there are still elements left in `nums2`, they are added to the beginning of `nums1`.\\n\\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the approach:\\n\\n1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to the last valid index of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.\\n2. Initialize a counter `counter` to the last valid index of `nums1`.\\n3. While both `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to 0, compare `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`. \\n   - If `nums2[j]` is greater or equal to `nums1[i]`, set `nums1[counter]` to `nums2[j]`, decrement `j` and `counter`.\\n   - Otherwise, set `nums1[counter]` to `nums1[i]`, set `nums1[i]` to 0 (to mark the element as \"used\"), decrement `i` and `counter`.\\n4. If there are still elements left in `nums2`, copy them to the beginning of `nums1`.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n    O(m+n)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n    O(1)\\n\\nThe `time complexity` of the given code is `O(m + n)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. This is because the code iterates through both arrays only once, comparing and copying elements as needed.\\n\\nThe `space complexity` of the code is `O(1)`, as it uses constant extra space for the `i`, `j`, and `counter` variables. The original input array `nums1` is modified in place to hold the merged elements, and no additional data structures are used. Therefore, the space used by the algorithm does not depend on the size of the input arrays.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:\\n \\n        i , j = m-1 , n-1\\n        counter = (m+n)-1\\n        while j >= 0  and i >= 0 :\\n            if nums2[j] >= nums1[i]: \\n                nums1[counter] = nums2[j]\\n                counter -= 1\\n                j -= 1\\n            else:\\n                nums1[counter] = nums1[i]\\n                nums1[i] = 0\\n                counter -= 1\\n                i -=1\\n        \\n        if j >= 0:\\n            for k in range(j+1):\\n                nums1[k] = nums2[k]\\n\\n\\n```",

One pile has some red toys and the other pile has some blue toys. Now, you want to put all the toys together in a big pile, but you want to make sure that the toys are still sorted by their colors.\\n\\nTo do this, you take one toy from the red pile and one toy from the blue pile and put them in the big pile. If the red toy is bigger than the blue toy, you put the red toy in the big pile first. If the blue toy is bigger than the red toy, you put the blue toy in the big pile first.\\n\\nYou keep doing this until you have put all the toys in the big pile. If there are still some toys left in the blue pile, you just put them in the big pile without comparing them to any red toys.\\n\\nThis is kind of like what the code is doing. It takes two arrays of numbers that are already sorted, and puts them together into one big array that is also sorted. It does this by comparing the last number in each array, and putting the bigger number in the big array first. It keeps doing this until all the numbers are in the big array."
