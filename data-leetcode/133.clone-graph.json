I had to think of it intuitively for a long time before I got it and thought I\\'d write an explanation for dummies like me\\n**Explanation**\\nThink of the problem in this. We cannot do regular binary search because of the rotation.\\n* Example: ```nums```: [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n* Ideally this would have looked as [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, **12**, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]\\nBut it is rotated at a pivot number: 12. This is ```nums[0]```. Let\\'s call it  pivot number for this explanation.\\n\\nLet\\'s call the left increasing sub sequence as **left half** and right increasing subsequence as **right half**. \\n\\n**HERE\\'S THE GIST OF THE SOLUTION LOGIC: THE PROBLEM IN NOT BEING ABLE TO DO REGULAR BINARY SEARCH IS: WHEN YOUR MID POINT AND TARGET END UP BEING IN DIFFERENT HALVES (ONE IS IN LEFT AND OTHER IN RIGHT OR VICE VERSA). IF THEY ARE BOTH IN SAME HALF, IT\\'S JUST LIKE REGULAR BINARY SEARCH BECAUSE YOU WILL CONVERGE TOWARDS THE TARGET ON THAT STEP OF THE BINARY SEARCH. IF YOU ENDED UP IN SEPARATE HALVES, WE CAN CONVERGE TOWARDS THE TARGET BY MAKING IT -INF OR INF LIKE SHOWN BELOW.**\\nHere\\'s the trick:\\n* If ```target``` is say in the left half, then when searching we need to make the numbers as \\n\\t*  [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf] \\n*  if ```target``` is in right half then we need to make it as \\n\\t*  [-inf, -inf, -inf, -inf, -inf, -inf, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n\\nWe don\\'t need to edit the actual array like that, we just need to make the comparator number(in regular case, the mid point that we select) to INF or -INF based on which side the ```target``` is and which side the mid point number is.\\n\\nOkay, but we don\\'t need to always use the comparator as -inf or inf. Think of the case when that is possible?\\nThat\\'s when your ```target``` and ```nums[mid]``` are on the same half side (left or right half). THis means that your mid point and target are on the same half and you are converging towards the target. So then just keep doing regular binary for that step and let the comparator be ```nums[mid]```.\\n* How do we check if they both (```nums[mid]``` and ```target```) are on the same half? We have to check if they are both greater than the pivot number or both smaller than pivot number \\n\\t* ```if (((nums[mid] > nums[0]) && (target > nums[0])) || ((nums[mid] <= nums[0]) && (target <= nums[0])))```.\\n\\t* This can also be done as ```if ((target > nums[0]) == (nums[mid] > nums[0]))```.\\n\\t* Ok, so if they both are on the same half let our comparator be ```nums[mid]```, because we are converging towards the target and are on the same half at the moment of comparision.\\n\\t*  ```comparator = nums[mid]```\\n\\t*  proceed with comparing how you do regular binary search comparision.\\n\\nBut, what if ```nums[mid]``` and ```target``` are on different halves? Then we have to not use the ```nums[mid]``` as comparator. We have to use -INF or INF. How can we decide whether to make comparator as  -INF or INF instead of ```nums[mid]```?\\n* target and ```nums[mid]``` are on different halves. we have to change ```nums[mid]``` to -INF or INF.\\n* Let\\'s find out which side ```nums[mid]``` is. If we know which half (left or right) it is in, we know whether to select -INF or INF.\\n* Compare target to ```nums[0]```. (Why compare ```target``` and not ```nums[mid]``` because we want to make the numbers on ```nums[mid]``` \\'s side as -INF or INF when comparing, not on ```target```\\'s side, so we use target as the reference)\\n* if ```target``` is greater than ```nums[0]```, target is on the **left half**. Look at the example above and you can see this.\\n\\t* For example: ```target``` is 14, it is greater than 12 so it belongs in **left half**\\n\\t* This means that ```nums[mid]``` is on the other half: **right half**. Make comparator as INF.\\n* if ```target``` is less than nums[0], target is on the **right half**. Look at the example above:\\n\\t* For example if ```target``` is 5, it is less than 12 so it belongs in **right half**\\n\\t* This means that ```nums[mid]``` is on the other half. **left half**. make comparator as -INF.\\n\\nNow you can go ahead and do binary search\\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n**CODE:**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) \\n    {\\n            int l = 0, r = nums.size()-1;\\n            while(l <= r)\\n            {\\n                int mid = (r - l)/2 + l;\\n                int comparator = nums[mid];\\n                // Checking if both target and nums[mid] are on same side.\\n                if((target < nums[0]) && (nums[mid] < nums[0]) || (target >= nums[0]) && (nums[mid] >= nums[0]))\\n                    comparator = nums[mid];\\n                else\\n                {\\n                    // Trying to figure out where nums[mid] is and making comparator as -INF or INF\\n                    if(target <nums[0])\\n                        comparator = -INFINITY;\\n                    else \\n                        comparator = INFINITY;\\n\\n                }\\n                if(target == comparator) return mid;\\n                if(target > comparator)            \\n                    l = mid+1;            \\n                else\\n                    r = mid-1;\\n\\n            }\\n            return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n",

                "content": "# Problem Understanding\\n\\nThe task is to search for a target integer in a sorted array that has been rotated at an unknown pivot. \\n\\nFor instance, the array $$[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]$$ could be rotated at the 4th position to give $$[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]$$. The challenge is to find the position of the target integer in this rotated array. \\n\\n![example.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/368df713-a386-4fd6-92eb-72d7606ac16f_1691456157.2050898.png)\\n\\n- The top section shows the `nums` array with a red rectangle highlighting the current \"mid\" value being considered in each step.\\n- The bottom section displays a table that presents the steps of the binary search. Each row corresponds to a step, detailing:\\n  - The step number.\\n  - The indices of the low (L), mid (M), and high (R) pointers.\\n  - The values at the low (L), mid (M), and high (R) positions.\\n\\n# Live Coding & Explenation\\nhttps://youtu.be/hywGbVJldj0\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\nGiven the properties of the array, it\\'s tempting to perform a linear search. However, that would result in a time complexity of $$O(n)$$. Instead, we can use the properties of the array to our advantage and apply a binary search to find the target with time complexity of $$ O(\\\\log n) $$ only.\\n\\n## Treating the Rotated Array\\n\\nAlthough the array is rotated, it retains some properties of sorted arrays that we can leverage. Specifically, one half of the array (either the left or the right) will always be sorted. This means we can still apply binary search by determining which half of our array is sorted and whether the target lies within it.\\n\\n## Binary Search\\n\\nBinary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.\\n\\n## Initialization\\n\\nWe start with two pointers:\\n\\n- $$ \\\\text{left} $$ - This represents the beginning of the array. We initialize it to 0, the index of the first element.\\n- $$ \\\\text{right} $$ - This represents the end of the array. It\\'s set to $$ n - 1 $$, the index of the last element, where $$ n $$ is the length of the array.\\n\\n## Iterative Binary Search\\n\\nWe perform the binary search within a while loop until $$ \\\\text{left} $$ exceeds $$ \\\\text{right} $$. In each iteration, we calculate the midpoint between $$ \\\\text{left} $$ and $$ \\\\text{right} $$.\\n\\n### Deciding the Sorted Half:\\n\\nAt any point during the search in the rotated array, one half (either the left or the right) will always be sorted. Determining which half is sorted is crucial for our modified binary search. \\n\\n- **If left half $$[low...mid]$$ is sorted**: We know this if the element at $$ \\\\text{low} $$ is less than or equal to the element at $$ \\\\text{mid} $$. In a normally sorted array, if the start is less than or equal to the midpoint, it means all elements till the midpoint are in the correct increasing order.\\n\\n  - **If the target lies within this sorted left half**: We know this if the target is greater than or equal to the element at $$ \\\\text{low} $$ and less than the element at $$ \\\\text{mid} $$. If this is the case, we then move our search to this half, meaning, we update $$ \\\\text{high} $$ to $$ \\\\text{mid} - 1 $$.\\n\\n  - **Otherwise**: The target must be in the right half. So, we update $$ \\\\text{low} $$ to $$ \\\\text{mid} + 1 $$.\\n\\n- **If right half $$[mid...high]$$ is sorted**: This is the else part. If the left half isn\\'t sorted, the right half must be!\\n\\n  - **If the target lies within this sorted right half**: We know this if the target is greater than the element at $$ \\\\text{mid} $$ and less than or equal to the element at $$ \\\\text{high} $$. If so, we move our search to this half by updating $$ \\\\text{low} $$ to $$ \\\\text{mid} + 1 $$.\\n\\n  - **Otherwise**: The target must be in the left half. So, we update $$ \\\\text{high} $$ to $$ \\\\text{mid} - 1 $$.\\n\\n### Rationale:\\n\\nThe beauty of this approach lies in its ability to determine with certainty which half of the array to look in, even though the array is rotated. By checking which half of the array is sorted and then using the sorted property to determine if the target lies in that half, we can effectively eliminate half of the array from consideration at each step, maintaining the $$ O(\\\\log n) $$ time complexity of the binary search.\\n\\n## Complexity\\n\\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity is $$ O(\\\\log n) $$ since we\\'re performing a binary search over the elements of the array.\\n\\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is $$ O(1) $$ because we only use a constant amount of space to store our variables ($$ \\\\text{left} $$, $$\\\\text{right} $$, $$ \\\\text{mid} $$), regardless of the size of the input array.\\n\\n# Performance\\n\\n![33-per.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/1306fe69-ec15-427c-90e0-c641ed275b2f_1691455472.463153.png)\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n\\n``` Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\\n        left, right = 0, len(nums) -

And values from IP + 1 until end are also ascending (`binary search`, wink, wink).\\nAlso the values from [0, IP] are always bigger than [IP + 1, n].\\n\\n#### intuition:\\nWe can perform a Binary Search.\\nIf **A[mid] is bigger than A[left]** we know the inflection point will be to the right of us, meaning values from a[left]...a[mid] **are ascending**.\\n\\nSo if `target` is between that range we just `cut our search space to the left`.\\nOtherwise go right.\\n\\n**The other condition is that A[mid] is not bigger than A[left]** meaning **a[mid]...a[right] is ascending**.\\nIn the same manner we can check if target is in that range and cut the search space correspondingly.\\n\\n##### Time complexity: O(logn)\\n##### Space complexity: O(1)\\n<hr/>\\n\\n### Algorithm:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def search(self, A: List[int], target: int) -> int:\\n        n = len(A)\\n        left, right = 0, n - 1\\n        if n == 0: return -1\\n        \\n        while left <= right:\\n            mid = left + (right - left) // 2\\n            if A[mid] == target: return mid\\n            \\n            # inflection point to the right.

So we should keep searching in nums[0..i] if the target lies in this sorted range, i.e., if `nums[0] <= target <= nums[i]`.\\n\\n- **If nums[i] < nums[0]**, then nums[0..i] contains a drop, and thus nums[i+1..end] is sorted and lies strictly between nums[i] and nums[0]. So we should keep searching in nums[0..i] if the target *doesn't* lie strictly between them, i.e., if `target <= nums[i] < nums[0]` or `nums[i] < nums[0] <= target`\\n\\nThose three cases look cyclic:\\n\\n        nums[0] <= target <= nums[i]\\n                   target <= nums[i] < nums[0]\\n                             nums[i] < nums[0] <= target\\n\\nSo I have the three checks `(nums[0] <= target)`, `(target <= nums[i])` and `(nums[i] < nums[0])`, and I want to know whether exactly two of them are true. They can't all be true or all be false (check it), so I just need to distinguish between \"two true\" and \"one true\". Parity is enough for that, so instead of adding them I xor them, which is a bit shorter and particularly helpful in Java and Ruby, because those don't let me add booleans but do let me xor them.\\n\\n(Actually while developing this I thought of permutations of nums[0], target and nums[i] and the permutation parity and saw those three checks as representing inversions, but I had trouble putting that into words and now find the above explanation much better. But it helped me get there, so I wanted to mention it here.)",

This ensures that the search space is not empty.\\nInside the while loop, we check if the middle element nums[mid] is equal to the target. If it is, we return the index mid.\\nIf the middle element is greater than or equal to the left element, it means the left part of the array is non-rotated.\\nWe then check if the target is within the range of the left non-rotated part. If it is, we update the right pointer to mid - 1 to search in the left part.\\nIf the target is not within the range, we update the left pointer to mid + 1 to search in the right part.\\nIf the middle element is less than the left element, it means the right part of the array is rotated.\\nWe then check if the target is within the range of the right rotated part. If it is, we update the left pointer to mid + 1 to search in the right part.\\nIf the target is not within the range, we update the right pointer to mid - 1 to search in the left part.\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(log n)\\n\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->O(1)\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n     int n = nums.size();\\n      int left = 0;\\n      int right = n-1;\\n      int mid= left + (right - left) / 2;\\n      while(left <= right){\\n        if(nums[mid] == target)\\n         return mid;\\n        if(nums[mid] >= nums[left]) {\\n          if(target >= nums[left] && target <= nums[mid])\\n            {\\n                right = mid - 1;\\n            }\\n           else left = mid + 1;\\n        } \\n        else {\\n          if(target >= nums[mid] && target <= nums[right]) \\n            left = mid + 1;\\n          else right = mid - 1;\\n        }\\n          mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\\n      }\\n      return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n![upvote 1.jpeg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/c8840309-29a1-4863-bf1b-90c2f8bd1387_1678528531.5008342.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

                "content": "# Intuition:\\nThe given problem asks us to find the index of the target element in the given rotated sorted array.\\n\\n# Approach:\\n- The solution provided in the code implements two approaches, Brute force and Binary search.\\n\\n    - The Brute force approach: \\n        1. Iterates through the array and checks if the current element is equal to the target. If it is, then it returns the index of that element, otherwise, it returns -1. This approach has a time complexity of O(n).\\n\\n    - The Binary search approach is based on the fact that a rotated sorted array can be divided into two sorted arrays.\\n        1. The approach starts with finding the mid element and compares it with the target element. \\n        2. If they are equal, it returns the mid index. If the left half of the array is sorted, then it checks if the target lies between the start and the mid, and updates the end pointer accordingly. \\n        3. Otherwise, it checks if the target lies between mid and end, and updates the start pointer accordingly. \\n        4. If the right half of the array is sorted, then it checks if the target lies between mid and end, and updates the start pointer accordingly. \\n        5. Otherwise, it checks if the target lies between start and mid, and updates the end pointer accordingly. \\n        6. This process continues until the target element is found, or the start pointer becomes greater than the end pointer, in which case it returns -1. \\n        7. This approach has a time complexity of O(log n).\\n\\n# Complexity:\\n\\n- Time Complexity:\\n    1. The time complexity of the Brute force approach is O(n), where n is the size of the input array.\\n    2. The time complexity of the Binary search approach is O(log n), where n is the size of the input array.\\n\\n- Space Complexity:\\nThe space complexity of both approaches is O(1) as we are not using any extra space to store any intermediate results.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n# Code:  C++\\n## Brute Force:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){\\n            if(target==nums[i]){\\n                return i;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n## Binary Search:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int start=0,end=nums.size()-1;\\n        int mid= (start+end)/2;\\n        while(start<=end){\\n            mid=(start+end)/2;\\n            if(target==nums[mid]){\\n                return mid;\\n            }\\n            if(nums[start]<=nums[mid]){\\n                if(nums[start]<=target && nums[mid]>=target){\\n                    end=mid-1;\\n                }\\n                else{\\n                    start=mid+1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            else{\\n                if(nums[end]>=target && nums[mid]<=target){\\n                    start=mid+1;\\n                }\\n                else{\\n                    end=mid-1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Code: Java\\n## Binary Search:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {\\n        int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;\\n        int mid = (start + end) / 2;\\n        while (start <= end) {\\n            mid = (start + end) / 2;\\n            if (target == nums[mid]) {\\n                return mid;\\n            }\\n            if (nums[start] <= nums[mid]) {\\n                if (nums[start] <= target && nums[mid] >= target) {\\n                    end = mid - 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    start = mid + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (nums[end] >= target && nums[mid] <= target) {\\n                    start = mid + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    end = mid - 1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Code: Python\\n## Binary Search:\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def search(self, nums, target):\\n        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1\\n        mid = (start + end) / 2\\n        while start <= end:\\n            mid = (start + end) / 2\\n            if target == nums[mid]:\\n                return mid\\n            if nums[start] <= nums[mid]:\\n                if nums[start] <= target and nums[mid] >= target:\\n                    end = mid - 1\\n                else:\\n                    start = mid + 1\\n            else:\\n                if nums[end] >= target and nums[mid] <= target:\\n                    start = mid + 1\\n                else:\\n                    end = mid - 1\\n        return -1\\n\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Code: JavaScript\\n## Binary Search:\\n```\\nvar search = function(nums, target) {\\n    let start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;\\n    let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);\\n    while (start <= end) {\\n        mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);\\n        if (target === nums[mid]) {\\n            return mid;\\n        }\\n        if (nums[start] <= nums[mid]) {\\n            if (nums[start] <= target && nums[mid] >= target) {\\n                end = mid - 1;\\n            } else {\\n                start = mid + 1;\\n            }\\n        } else {\\n            if (nums[end] >= target && nums[mid] <= target) {\\n                start = mid + 1;\\n            } else {\\n                end = mid - 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n\\n```\\n> # ***Thanks For Voting***\\n",

Enter a loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`.\\n\\n3. Calculate the middle index `mid` as `i + (j - i) / 2`.\\n\\n4. Check if the element at index `mid` is equal to the target. If it is, return `mid` as the index where the target is found.\\n\\n5. Check if the left part of the interval (from `i` to `mid`) is sorted:\\n\\n   a. If `nums[mid] >= nums[i]`, then the left part is sorted.\\n\\n   b. Check if the target is within the range of values in the left sorted part (`nums[i]` to `nums[mid]`).

The approach to solving this problem is to modify the regular Binary Search algorithm to handle the rotated sorted array.\\n\\nThe intuition behind this approach is that the rotated sorted array can be divided into two parts, one part is still sorted, and the other part is also sorted, but the minimum element of the array is somewhere in the middle of the array. We can identify which part of the array is still sorted by comparing the middle element of the array with the first element of the array. If the middle element is greater than or equal to the first element, then the left part of the array is sorted, and if the middle element is less than the first element, then the right part of the array is sorted.\\n\\nOnce we have identified which part of the array is sorted, we can check if the target element is present in the sorted part of the array using the regular Binary Search algorithm. If the target element is not present in the sorted part of the array, we can search for it in the other part of the array by recursively calling the same Binary Search algorithm on that part.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(log n)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(1)\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n\\n        \\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int size=nums.size();\\n       int s=0,e=size-1,m=0;\\n        while(s<=e){\\n                m=s+(e-s)/2;\\n                if(nums[m]==target) return m;\\n                if(nums[m]>=nums[s]){\\n                if(nums[m]>=target && nums[s]<=target) e=m-1;\\n                else s=m+1;}\\n                else{\\n                    if(nums[m]<=target && nums[e]>=target) s=m+1;\\n                    else e=m-1;\\n                }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n        \\n\\n        \\n    }\\n};\\n```",

It should be either numbers greater than nums[mid] or less than or equal to nums[r]. So check if target is in this range, if yes, we pick the right side by updating index l to mid + 1, otherwise, we pick the left side. Giving an example here, \\n4 5 6 7 **8 1 2 3**.

                "content": "Ayo, here\\'s another solution! Pretty simple if you get the idea.\\n\\nHere\\'s what\\'s important:\\n- We do regular binary search on the array. We need to find a target but the array is rotated. What do we do?\\n- Did you see how there are 2 parts in the array that are sorted?\\n- For array [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]\\n\\t- Part 1: [4,5,6,7]\\n\\t- Part 2: [0,1,2]\\n- This is the only thing that\\'s going to help us solve the problem.\\n\\nApply regular binary search on the array, but here\\'s what we\\'re going to change:\\n1. Calculate mid as usual.\\n2. First, check if the array has been rotated by checking if you\\'re in the 1st or 2nd part of the array.\\n3. If you\\'re in first part, your arr[low] will be smaller than arr[mid] because remember, the 1st part of the array is sorted.\\n\\n4. If the number at low is indeed smaller than mid, then we search for the target in this low->mid range. \\n\\t**A.** So, check if target is greater/equal to low and target is smaller than mid (but not smaller or equal because if it were equal to mid, we would have returned the answer). If it does lie between low and mid, let\\'s narrow search down to low to mid by making our high equal to mid.\\n\\t**B.** If the target doesn\\'t lie between low and mid, then surely it must lie beyond mid. So we narrow search down to `mid+1` to `high` by setting `low = mid + 1`.\\n\\n7. Similarly, check again for array rotation. If mid is not greater than low, then it must be smaller than low. Which means we\\'re in the 2nd sorted part of the array.\\n\\t**A.** So, check if target is greater than mid and target is smaller/equal to high. If it does lie between mid and high, let\\'s narrow search down to mid to mid by making our low equal to mid+1.\\n\\t**B.** If the target doesn\\'t lie between mid and high, then it\\'s probably because it\\'s greater than both mid and high, meaning that it belongs in the 1st part of rotated sorted array. So we narrow search down to `low` to `mid` by setting `low = mid`.\\n\\nSo basically, binary search stuff comes later, we just first check what part of the rotation we\\'re in before making any moves.\\n\\t\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int low = 0;\\n        int high = nums.size() - 1;\\n        \\n        while(low <= high){\\n            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n            \\n            if(nums[mid] == target){\\n                return mid;\\n            }\\n            \\n            // if low is less than mid (not less or equal because equal is handled by the previous if statement), then low to mid is sorted\\n            if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]){\\n                // if target is between low to mid,\\n                // narrow search down to low to mid\\n                if(target >= nums[low] and target <= nums[mid]){\\n                    high = mid;\\n                } else {\\n                    // if target is beyond mid\\n                    // narrow search down to mid + 1 to high\\n                    low = mid + 1;\\n                }\\n                // if low is greater than mid,\\n                // then we\\'re in the rotated part\\n            } else if (nums[low] > nums[mid]){\\n                // if target is between mid to high\\n                // narrow search down to mid to high\\n                if(target >= nums[mid] and target <= nums[high]){\\n                    low = mid + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    // if target is greater than high and mid both\\n                    // narrow search down to the second part before\\n                    // mid.

                "content": "Nice one to practice a bit binary searches, since with my approach we will need it not once, but twice - one to find the rotational pivot, one to find the actual element.\\n\\nWe will need first of all a few support variables:\\n* `len` will store the lenght of `nums`;\\n* `l`, `r` and `mid` will be the cogs of our binary search, witht the first 2 initialised to be `0` and `len`, respectively.\\n\\nOne peculiar case is when `l == len`, which means the array is fully sorted, so we have to check inside all of it, resetting `l` to `0`.\\n\\nWe proceed then with the first binary search to find the pivot around which the vector/array was rotated, looping as long as `l < r`:\\n* at each step we compute first of all `mid` as the average of `l` and `r`;\\n* if `nums[mid]` is greater than or equal to the first element, it means we need to keep looking to the right to find a pivot, so we update the value of `l`;\\n* conversely, it means we need to search to the left, so we update `r` before iterating again.\\n\\nOnce we move out of the first search, we have the index of what would be the first element in a fully sorted vector - and that is also the smallest one, so at this point we can decide if we want to search either in the `[0 - l)` or in the `[l - len)` range.\\n\\nWe proceed rather trivially with a similar approach to the previous to look for `target` in the interval we just decided, with an extra step:\\n* we check if `mid` is by any chance already pointing at the value of `target` - this might not be ideal in terms of performance, but I noticed that it avoided me a few annoying edge cases. If so, we just return `mid`;\\n* depending on the value of `nums[mid]` compared to `target`, we either move right (updating `l`) or left (updating `r`).\\n\\nProvided we did not encounter it already as a value of `mid`, once we exit the loop we return `l` if it points to `target`, `-1` othewise.\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        // support variables\\n        int len = nums.size(), l = 0, r = len, mid;\\n        // finding the pivot\\n        while (l < r) {\\n            mid = (l + r) / 2;\\n            // current element > first elemen: we move the window right\\n            if (nums[mid] >= nums[0]) l = mid + 1;\\n            // otherwise we move it left\\n            else r = mid;\\n        }\\n        // checking for edge case - pivot at the end = sorted vector\\n        if (l == len) l = 0;\\n        // preparing for the next BS: target is between pivot and the last element\\n        if (target >= nums[l] && target <= nums.back()) r = len;\\n        // target is between the first element and the one before pivot\\n        else r = l, l = 0;\\n        // all other cases\\n        // finding the element\\n        while (l < r) {\\n            mid = (l + r) / 2;\\n            // mid matches the target element: we return it\\n            if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;\\n            // mid matches an element smaller than target: we move the window right\\n            else if (nums[mid] < target) l = mid + 1;\\n            // otherwise we move it left\\n            else r = mid;\\n        }\\n        return nums[l] == target ? l : -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "The difficulty of applying binary search to this problem lies in how to determine the correct half for `target`. \\n\\nWhen we do binary search, we start wtih a `l` pointer and a `r` pointer. Then we compute the `m` pointer, if `nums[m]` happens to be `target`, then we are of luck. Otherwise, `nums[m]` can be either to the left or right of `target`. If `nums[m]` is to the left of `target`, we search for the right half; otherwise the left half. So we need to figure out how to check whether `nums[m]` is to the left or right of `target`.\\n\\nWhen `nums[m]` is to the left of `target`: `nums[l] nums[m] target nums[r]`, we will have three cases:\\n\\n1. `nums[l] > nums[m] < target`;\\n2. `nums[l] <= nums[m] > target`;\\n3. `nums[l] <= nums[m] < target`.\\n\\nNote that `m` may be just `l` since the division to compute `m` is a floor division.\\n\\nSimilarly, when `nums[m]` is to the right of `target`: `nums[l] target nums[m] nums[r]`, we will have other three cases:\\n\\n4. `nums[l] > target < nums[m]`;\\n5. `nums[l] <= target > nums[m]`;\\n6. `nums[l] <= target < nums[m]`.\\n\\nYou may just code either cases 1, 2, 3 or cases 4, 5, 6 to determine whether to check the left or right half. The code is as follows.\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int n = nums.size(), l = 0, r = n - 1;\\n        while (l <= r) {\\n            int m = (l + r) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            }\\n            if (left(nums[l], nums[m], target)) {\\n                l = m + 1;\\n            } else {\\n                r = m - 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\nprivate:\\n    bool left(int l, int m, int t) {\\n        return (l > m && l > t && m < t) || (l <= m && l > t && m > t) || (l <= m && l < t && m < t);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn general binary search, we will compare `nums[m]` with `target` to determine the half.\\n\\nWhen `nums[m] > target`, it corresponds to cases 2, 4, and 6. In case 2, we need to check for the right half while in cases 4 and 6 the left. And cases 4 and 6 can be compressed into `nums[l] <= target || nums[l] > nums[m]`.\\n\\nSimilarly, when `nums[m] < target`, it corresponds to cases 1, 3, and 5. In case 5, we need to check the left while in cases 1 and 3 the right. And cases 1 and 3 can be compressed into `nums[l] > target || nums[l] <= nums[m]`.\\n\\nUsing the above compressed checks, we will come to the following code.\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1;\\n        while (l <= r) {\\n            int m = (l + r) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            }\\n            if (nums[m] > target) {\\n                if (nums[l] <= target || nums[l] > nums[m]) {\\n                    r = m - 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    l = m + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (nums[l] > target || nums[l] <= nums[m]) {\\n                    l = m + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    r = m - 1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nYou may wonder, for example, when `nums[m] > target`, why don\\'t we need a check for case 2 before entering `l = m + 1`? Actually, when `nums[l] <= target || nums[l] > nums[m]` does not hold, it is just case 2. Similarly you can explain why we don\\'t need to check for case 5 before entering `r = m - 1` below.\\n\\nAnother simple approach is to use the sorted version of the array by applying some tricks to the indices. It is not easy to search in `4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2`, but it is very easy to search in `0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7`. Suppose you would like to visit the `3`-rd element in the sorted array, in this case, it is just the `(3 + 4) % 7 = 0`-th element in the rotated array. The `4` is just the index of the minimum. You can find it out using the same idea of [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/).\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1, idx = findMinIdx(nums);\\n        while (l <= r) {\\n            int m = l + (r - l) / 2, mid = (m + idx) % nums.size();\\n            if (nums[mid] == target) {\\n                return mid;\\n            }\\n            if (nums[mid] < target) {\\n                l = m + 1;\\n            } else {\\n                r = m - 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\nprivate:\\n    int findMinIdx(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1;\\n        while (l < r && nums[l] > nums[r]) {\\n            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] > nums[r]) {\\n                l = m + 1;\\n            } else {\\n                r = m;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return l;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

For convenience, here we only talk about cases where the array was originally sorted in ascending order.

In a rotated sorted array, we call a point inflection point (red line shown as below) such that all the elements in its left interval are greater than the first element, and all the elements in its right interval are less than the first element.\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/e4a78dcb-2be8-4f17-88cf-9f6e7698c2e3_1595998500.6699812.png)\\n\\n\\n### Alogrithm\\n\\nSame as the regular binary search, the idea of solving this problem is keep narrowing down the search range until the target is found. However, we can\\'t eliminate half of the elements every time by just comparing target and nums[mid] since the entire array is neither in ascending order nor in descending order after the rotation. But we can still find a monotone interval and use it to narrow down the search range. \\n\\n   - If nums[mid] >= nums[left], then [left, mid] is a monotone interval in which all the elements are sorted in ascending order. In this case, if target is within range [left, mid), then we narrow down the search range to [left, mid-1], therwise we narrow down search range to [mid+1, right]. \\n   - If nums[mid] < nums[left], then [mid, right] is a monotone interval in which all the elements are sorted in ascending order.

                "content": "To solve this problem with O(log n) time complexity, we can use a modified binary search algorithm.\\n\\n1. First, we find the pivot point where the array is rotated. This can be done using binary search. We start with the middle element and check if it is greater than the last element. If it is, then the pivot must be in the right half of the array. If it is not, then the pivot must be in the left half of the array. We continue this process until we find the pivot element.\\n\\n2. Once we know the pivot point, we can perform binary search on the appropriate half of the array. If the target is less than or equal to the last element in the left half, then we search the left half. Otherwise, we search the right half.\\n\\n3. In each iteration of the binary search, we check the middle element of the current range. If it is equal to the target, we return its index. If it is greater than the target, we search the left half. Otherwise, we search the right half. If we reach the end of the range without finding the target, we return -1.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: The algorithm uses binary search twice, once to find the pivot and once to find the target. Both binary searches take $$O(log n)$$ time. Therefore, the total time complexity is $$O(log n)$$.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables such as left, right, mid, and pivot.

However, Binary search algorithm only works if all the element in the array is sorted, when we have a `pivot` or `rotate` point in our array, we will find that the array is splited in to two parts, 1 to the left of the `rotate` point where everything is sorterd, and 1 to the right(included the `rotate` point) where everything is sorted. In order to apply binary search to find our `target`, we need to figure our which part of the sorted array does the `target` belong to, and from there everything is just standard binary search. \\n\\n*How can we find which part is it in?*\\nwe can make sure a part of the array is all sorted, if the beginning number is smaller than the end number, other wise, there must be a `rotate` point in between\\n\\n``` javascript\\nvar search1pass = function(nums, target) {\\n    if (nums.length == 0) {\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n    if (nums.length == 1) {\\n        return nums[0] == target?0:-1;\\n    }\\n    let low = 0, high = nums.length - 1;\\n    while (low <= high) {\\n        mid = parseInt((low + (high - low)/2))\\n        if (target == nums[mid]) {\\n            return mid\\n        } else if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) { // this means everything in between `low` & `mid` is in correct order\\n            // if target is bigger than nums[low] (the smallest # in this partial array) and smaller than nums[mid](the biggest # in this partial array)\\n            if (target >= nums[low] && target < nums[mid]) { \\n                high = mid - 1; // shift the right boundary to left of mid\\n            } else {\\n                // otherwise, our target is in the other end, shift the left boundary to right of mid\\n                low = mid + 1;\\n            }\\n        } else { // there must be a rotate point in between `low` and `mid`, and in between `mid` and `high`, the numbers should be in correct order\\n            // if the target is in between `mid` and `high`\\n            if (target <= nums[high] && target > nums[mid]) {\\n                low = mid + 1; // shift the left boundary to the right of mid\\n            } else {\\n                high = mid - 1 // shift the right boudary to the left of mid, \\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```\\n**I think this version is better since it\\'s more consistent and easier to understand**\\n```\\nvar search = function(nums, target) {\\n    let left=0, right=nums.length-1;\\n    while(left < right) {\\n        let mid = left + Math.floor((right - left)/2);\\n        if (nums[mid] < nums[right]) {\\n            if (target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[right]) {\\n                left = mid + 1;\\n            } else {\\n                right = mid;\\n            }\\n        } else {\\n            if (target > nums[mid] || target < nums[left]) {\\n                left = mid + 1;\\n            } else {\\n                right = mid;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return nums[left]==target?left:-1;\\n};\\n```\\nIf you wan to read more on how to write consisntent binary search code, check out my tutorial [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/discuss/423162/Binary-Search-101-The-Ultimate-Binary-Search-Handbook)",

We divide the array into two parts: one that is sorted and the other that isn\\'t. By comparing the target with the elements at the middle and adjusting the pointers based on whether the left or right side is sorted, we can efficiently narrow down the search range.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n- Initialize two pointers, left and right, to the start and end indices of the array.\\n- Enter a binary search loop while left is less than or equal to right.\\n- Calculate the middle index, mid, using the formula (left + right) / 2.\\n- Check if the element at mid is the target. If so, return mid.\\n- Determine which side of the array is sorted: the left side (from left to mid) or the right side (from mid to right).\\n- Depending on which side is sorted, check if the target falls within the range of that side. If it does, adjust the pointers to narrow down the search range accordingly.\\n- If the target is not found in the current search range, update the pointers and repeat the process.\\n- If the loop ends and the target is not found, return -1.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: **O(log n)** - The algorithm halves the search range in each step, resulting in a logarithmic number of steps.\\n\\n\\n- Space complexity: **O(1)** - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables regardless of the input size.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int left = 0;\\n        int right = nums.size() - 1;\\n        \\n        while (left <= right) {\\n            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\\n            \\n            if (nums[mid] == target) {\\n                return mid; // Found the target\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Check which side is sorted\\n            if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {\\n                // Left side is sorted\\n                if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {\\n                    // Target is in the left sorted side\\n                    right = mid - 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    // Target is in the right unsorted side\\n                    left = mid + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                // Right side is sorted\\n                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {\\n                    // Target is in the right sorted side\\n                    left = mid + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    // Target is in the left unsorted side\\n                    right = mid - 1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return -1; // Target not found\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```\\n![upvote img.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b55c25eb-7c93-4665-82c4-29df36f019d8_1691474602.022517.jpeg)\\n",

                "content": "# Intuition\\n\\nWhen faced with the challenge of searching for an element in a rotated sorted array, our instinct might initially direct us towards a linear search. However, since the array is initially sorted before rotation, we realize that at any given point, at least one half of the array must still be in sorted order. This observation is the key. We can utilize a binary search approach but with a few modifications to account for the rotation. Both Go and Rust, as systems programming languages, are particularly adept at handling such low-level manipulations efficiently.\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n1. **Initialization**: We start with two pointers, `low` and `high`, indicating the start and the end of the array.\\n2. **Calculate Midpoint**: In every iteration of our loop, we find the midpoint of our current segment.\\n3. **Check for Target**: If the number at the midpoint is our target, we\\'ve found our number.\\n4. **Identify the Sorted Half**: We then determine which half of our current segment is sorted.\\n   - If the left half is sorted, we check if our target lies in this half by comparing it against the lowest and midpoint values. If it does, we adjust our `high` pointer to search in this segment. If not, it must be in the right half, so we adjust our `low` pointer accordingly.\\n   - Similarly, if the right half is sorted and the target lies within this half, we adjust our `low` pointer, else we adjust our `high` pointer.\\n5. **Repeat**: We then repeat the process in the identified half until we find our target or exhaust our search space.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n\\n- **Time complexity**: \\\\(O(\\\\log n)\\\\). The essence of this algorithm is still binary search. With each iteration, we halve our search space, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.\\n  \\n- **Space complexity**: \\\\(O(1)\\\\). We only use a constant amount of space for our variables (`low`, `high`, `mid`), irrespective of the size of the input array.\\n\\n# Code\\n```Go []\\nfunc search(nums []int, target int) int {\\n    low, high := 0, len(nums) - 1\\n\\n    for low <= high {\\n        mid := (low + high) / 2\\n\\n        if nums[mid] == target {\\n            return mid\\n        }\\n\\n        if nums[low] <= nums[mid] {\\n            if nums[low] <= target && target < nums[mid] {\\n                high = mid - 1\\n            } else {\\n                low = mid + 1\\n            }\\n        } else {\\n            if nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[high] {\\n                low = mid + 1\\n            } else {\\n                high = mid - 1\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    return -1\\n}\\n```\\n```Rust []\\nimpl Solution {\\n    pub fn search(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> i32 {\\n        let mut low = 0;\\n        let mut high = nums.len() as i32 - 1;\\n\\n        while low <= high {\\n            let mid = (low + high) / 2;\\n\\n            if nums[mid as usize] == target {\\n                return mid;\\n            }\\n\\n            if nums[low as usize] <= nums[mid as usize] {\\n                if nums[low as usize] <= target && target < nums[mid as usize] {\\n                    high = mid - 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    low = mid + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if nums[mid as usize] < target && target <= nums[high as usize] {\\n                    low = mid + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    high = mid - 1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        -1\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n``` Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\\n        low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1 \\n\\n        while low <= high: \\n            mid = (low + high) // 2 \\n\\n            if nums[mid] == target: \\n                return mid \\n\\n            if nums[low] <= nums[mid]: \\n                if nums[low] <= target < nums[mid]: \\n                    high = mid - 1 \\n                else: \\n                    low = mid + 1 \\n            else: \\n                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[high]: \\n                    low = mid + 1 \\n                else: \\n                    high = mid - 1 \\n\\n        return -1 \\n```\\n\\nThe coding style in both Go and Rust is quite expressive.

By comparing the target with the mid element, the code determines which half of the array to continue the search in.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n1. The code initializes the left and right pointers, representing the indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements in the search range.\\n. It enters a while loop where the search range is not empty (left <= right).\\n3. In each iteration, the code calculates the middle index mid as the average of the left and right indices.\\n4. If the target is equal to the element at the mid index, the function returns mid as the index of the target element.\\n5. If the element at the left index is less than or equal to the element at the mid index, it means the left half of the array is sorted in ascending order.\\n- If the target is within the range of the left half (between left and mid), the right pointer is updated to mid - 1 to continue the search in the left half.\\n- Otherwise, the left pointer is updated to mid + 1 to search in the right half.\\n6. If the element at the left index is greater than the element at the mid index, it means the right half of the array is sorted in ascending order.\\n- If the target is within the range of the right half (between mid and right), the left pointer is updated to mid + 1 to continue the search in the right half.\\n- Otherwise, the right pointer is updated to mid - 1 to search in the left half.\\n7.

As you do so, you will notice that it just consists of a few if-statements and is not difficult too difficult to code up at all. This is the first approach which is still an optimal approach.\\n\\nHowever, as you can see from other posts or if you ponder on the problem long enough, the code (shown below) can surely be condensed as there\\'s repetitive logic somewhere in there.

We can compeltely remove case 2 and simply always run case 1. \\n\\nWhy is this?\\n\\nLook at Case 1.1. Our code logic for case 1.1 is: `if(nums[mid] >= nums[L])`. In a regular sorted array like [0,1,2,3,4,5], this if statement is always true. Now if we look at Cases 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 that fall under Case 1.1, this is just the same as a regular binary search. \\n* Case 1.1.1 says: \"If target is between (MID, LEFT] --> Look at LEFT of MID -> R = mid-1, ELSE look at RIGHT of mid ->L = mid+1\\n\\nThis is just another way to write the if statements in a regular binary search!\\nAs a result, we can remove Case 2 entirely and always run Case 1 only. You would\\'ve gotten to this solution if you realized that Case 1.1 is not just checking if MID is in the left subarray, but it is actually also checking if MID is in the SORTED portion of the array which is always the input in a regular binary search. \\n\\n**Code**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int L = 0;\\n        int R = nums.size()-1;\\n        int mid;\\n        // L   R\\n        while(L <= R){\\n            mid = (L+R)/2;\\n            \\n            // found target\\n            if(nums[mid] == target)\\n                return mid;\\n\\n            // case 1.1: mid is in left subarray aka the SORTED subarray\\n            if(nums[mid] >= nums[L]){\\n                if(target >= nums[L] && target < nums[mid])\\n                    R = mid-1;\\n                else\\n                    L = mid+1;\\n\\n            // case 1.2: mid is in right subarray\\n            } else {\\n                if(target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[R])\\n                    L = mid+1;\\n                else\\n                    R = mid-1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n",

So, I thought to share a small story with you. In one of my interviews, the interviewer asked me a similiar question. I solved that in O(n) time complexicity but he asked me to optimize. I got the idea that it will be solve using binary search but I was confusing how to shift pointers. He gave me a hint how to shift pointers. At that time, it hit my mind and I solved it. Basically, if we have given these type of array, we check which side we are getting increasing sequence. It means in which half the array is sorted.\\n\\n**PS:** During interviews, if you are not getting anything, try to be interactive with the interviewer. Ask as much as hints you want. \\n\\n**Main code starts from here:**\\nThis is my easy and simple binary seach code. Here what we are doing basically, first we use simple binary search as we do. Like first we found the mid of the array. Now, we will see this in three steps:\\n\\n* First , we check mid element with the target element. If it is the target element then we will return its index.\\n* Either  we will check that the sorted array is in left half or in right half by comparing with mid-indexed element.\\n* If it is in left half, we will reduced our high pointer **high=mid-1** or it is in a right half we will increased our low pointer **low=mid+1**.\\n\\nHere is my code:\\n\\n```\\nint search(vector<int>& nums, int tar) {\\n        int low=0,high=nums.size()-1;\\n        \\n        while(low<=high)\\n        {\\n            long long mid=((high+low)/2);\\n            \\n\\t\\t\\t// Check whether mid element is target element or not\\n            if(nums[mid]==tar)\\n            return mid;\\n            \\n            // To check that first half is sorted or not\\n            if(nums[low]<=nums[mid])\\n            {\\n                if(tar>=nums[low] and tar<nums[mid])\\n                high=mid-1;\\n                else\\n                low=mid+1;\\n            }\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n            // To check that second half is sorted or not\\n            else\\n            {\\n                if(tar>nums[mid] and tar<=nums[high])\\n                low=mid+1;\\n                else\\n                high=mid-1;\\n            }     \\n        }\\n        \\n        return -1;        \\n    }\\n```\\n\\n**PS: Keep Coding...Keep Learning.**\\n",

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

In case of duplicate values, comparing with the rightmost element might lead to scenarios where we\\'re unable to decide which half of the array to proceed with, thus degrading the performance to O(n) in the worst-case scenario.

                        "content": "The main idea is to use binary search to find the target in the array. Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

                        "content": "The main idea is to use binary search to find the target in the array. Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

                        "content": "The main idea is to use binary search to find the target in the array. Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

In case of duplicate values, comparing with the rightmost element might lead to scenarios where we\\'re unable to decide which half of the array to proceed with, thus degrading the performance to O(n) in the worst-case scenario.

                        "content": "The main idea is to use binary search to find the target in the array. Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

In case of duplicate values, comparing with the rightmost element might lead to scenarios where we\\'re unable to decide which half of the array to proceed with, thus degrading the performance to O(n) in the worst-case scenario.

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

                        "content": "The main idea is to use binary search to find the target in the array. Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

In case of duplicate values, comparing with the rightmost element might lead to scenarios where we\\'re unable to decide which half of the array to proceed with, thus degrading the performance to O(n) in the worst-case scenario.

                        "content": "The main idea is to use binary search to find the target in the array. Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

In case of duplicate values, comparing with the rightmost element might lead to scenarios where we\\'re unable to decide which half of the array to proceed with, thus degrading the performance to O(n) in the worst-case scenario.

                        "content": "The main idea is to use binary search to find the target in the array. Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

Binary search is a technique that divides the search space into two halves and compares the target with the middle element. If the target is equal to the middle element, we have found the index. If the target is smaller than the middle element, we search in the left half. If the target is larger than the middle element, we search in the right half. This way, we can reduce the search space by half in each iteration and achieve O(log n) runtime complexity.\\n\\nHowever, since the array is possibly rotated at some unknown pivot, we cannot directly apply binary search. We need to modify it slightly to handle the rotation. The key observation is that one of the two halves must be sorted, and the other half must contain the pivot. For example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], then the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot. If the array is [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], then the right half [2,4,5,6] is sorted and the left half [7,0,1] contains the pivot.\\n\\nSo, in each iteration of binary search, we first check which half is sorted by comparing the left and middle elements. Then we check if the target is in that sorted half by comparing it with the left and middle elements. If it is in that sorted half, we search in that half as usual. If it is not in that sorted half, we search in the other half that contains the pivot.\\n\\nFor example, if the array is [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the target is 0:\\n\\n- We start with left = 0 and right = 6. The middle index is 3 and the middle element is 7.\\n- We see that the left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted and the right half [0,1,2] contains the pivot.\\n- We check if the target 0 is in the left half by comparing it with 4 and 7. It is not in that half because 0 < 4 < 7.\\n- So we search in the right half that contains the pivot by setting left = mid + 1 = 4.\\n- We repeat this process until we find the target or exhaust the search space."

If `nums[s] <= nums[m]` is true and `target` is not in the range of `nums[s]` to `nums[m]`, `s` will be updated to `m`. However, if `m` is equal to `s` (which is possible when `s` and `l` are consecutive), `s` will not move. This will cause an infinite loop, as `s` and `l` will not change. The same problem can occur with `l`.\\n\\nA standard binary search implementation makes sure that `s` or `l` always changes:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int s = 0;\\n        int l = nums.size();\\n        while (s < l) {\\n            int m = s + (l - s) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            } else if (nums[s] <= nums[m]) {\\n                if (target >= nums[s] && target < nums[m]) {\\n                    l = m;\\n                } else {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (target > nums[m] && target <= nums[l-1]) {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    l = m;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this code, if the target is not found, `s` or `l` will be updated such that it either increments or decrements. This way, the function is guaranteed to exit."

The same problem can occur with `l`.\\n\\nA standard binary search implementation makes sure that `s` or `l` always changes:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int s = 0;\\n        int l = nums.size();\\n        while (s < l) {\\n            int m = s + (l - s) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            } else if (nums[s] <= nums[m]) {\\n                if (target >= nums[s] && target < nums[m]) {\\n                    l = m;\\n                } else {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (target > nums[m] && target <= nums[l-1]) {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    l = m;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this code, if the target is not found, `s` or `l` will be updated such that it either increments or decrements. This way, the function is guaranteed to exit."

The same problem can occur with `l`.\\n\\nA standard binary search implementation makes sure that `s` or `l` always changes:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int s = 0;\\n        int l = nums.size();\\n        while (s < l) {\\n            int m = s + (l - s) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            } else if (nums[s] <= nums[m]) {\\n                if (target >= nums[s] && target < nums[m]) {\\n                    l = m;\\n                } else {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (target > nums[m] && target <= nums[l-1]) {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    l = m;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this code, if the target is not found, `s` or `l` will be updated such that it either increments or decrements. This way, the function is guaranteed to exit."

The same problem can occur with `l`.\\n\\nA standard binary search implementation makes sure that `s` or `l` always changes:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int s = 0;\\n        int l = nums.size();\\n        while (s < l) {\\n            int m = s + (l - s) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            } else if (nums[s] <= nums[m]) {\\n                if (target >= nums[s] && target < nums[m]) {\\n                    l = m;\\n                } else {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (target > nums[m] && target <= nums[l-1]) {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    l = m;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this code, if the target is not found, `s` or `l` will be updated such that it either increments or decrements. This way, the function is guaranteed to exit."

The same problem can occur with `l`.\\n\\nA standard binary search implementation makes sure that `s` or `l` always changes:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int s = 0;\\n        int l = nums.size();\\n        while (s < l) {\\n            int m = s + (l - s) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            } else if (nums[s] <= nums[m]) {\\n                if (target >= nums[s] && target < nums[m]) {\\n                    l = m;\\n                } else {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (target > nums[m] && target <= nums[l-1]) {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    l = m;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this code, if the target is not found, `s` or `l` will be updated such that it either increments or decrements. This way, the function is guaranteed to exit."

The same problem can occur with `l`.\\n\\nA standard binary search implementation makes sure that `s` or `l` always changes:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int s = 0;\\n        int l = nums.size();\\n        while (s < l) {\\n            int m = s + (l - s) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            } else if (nums[s] <= nums[m]) {\\n                if (target >= nums[s] && target < nums[m]) {\\n                    l = m;\\n                } else {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (target > nums[m] && target <= nums[l-1]) {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    l = m;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this code, if the target is not found, `s` or `l` will be updated such that it either increments or decrements. This way, the function is guaranteed to exit."

The same problem can occur with `l`.\\n\\nA standard binary search implementation makes sure that `s` or `l` always changes:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int s = 0;\\n        int l = nums.size();\\n        while (s < l) {\\n            int m = s + (l - s) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            } else if (nums[s] <= nums[m]) {\\n                if (target >= nums[s] && target < nums[m]) {\\n                    l = m;\\n                } else {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (target > nums[m] && target <= nums[l-1]) {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    l = m;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this code, if the target is not found, `s` or `l` will be updated such that it either increments or decrements. This way, the function is guaranteed to exit."

The same problem can occur with `l`.\\n\\nA standard binary search implementation makes sure that `s` or `l` always changes:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int s = 0;\\n        int l = nums.size();\\n        while (s < l) {\\n            int m = s + (l - s) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            } else if (nums[s] <= nums[m]) {\\n                if (target >= nums[s] && target < nums[m]) {\\n                    l = m;\\n                } else {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (target > nums[m] && target <= nums[l-1]) {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    l = m;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this code, if the target is not found, `s` or `l` will be updated such that it either increments or decrements. This way, the function is guaranteed to exit."

The same problem can occur with `l`.\\n\\nA standard binary search implementation makes sure that `s` or `l` always changes:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int s = 0;\\n        int l = nums.size();\\n        while (s < l) {\\n            int m = s + (l - s) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            } else if (nums[s] <= nums[m]) {\\n                if (target >= nums[s] && target < nums[m]) {\\n                    l = m;\\n                } else {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (target > nums[m] && target <= nums[l-1]) {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    l = m;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this code, if the target is not found, `s` or `l` will be updated such that it either increments or decrements. This way, the function is guaranteed to exit."

The same problem can occur with `l`.\\n\\nA standard binary search implementation makes sure that `s` or `l` always changes:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n        int s = 0;\\n        int l = nums.size();\\n        while (s < l) {\\n            int m = s + (l - s) / 2;\\n            if (nums[m] == target) {\\n                return m;\\n            } else if (nums[s] <= nums[m]) {\\n                if (target >= nums[s] && target < nums[m]) {\\n                    l = m;\\n                } else {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                }\\n            } else {\\n                if (target > nums[m] && target <= nums[l-1]) {\\n                    s = m + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    l = m;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIn this code, if the target is not found, `s` or `l` will be updated such that it either increments or decrements. This way, the function is guaranteed to exit."

However, in both cases, you are not adjusting the mid value correctly in the while loop.\\n\\nHere is a revised version of your code:\\n\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {\\n        int low = 0;\\n        int high = nums.length - 1;\\n        int pivot = 0;\\n        \\n        while (low <= high) {\\n            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n            if (mid > 0 && mid < nums.length - 1 && nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid] && nums[mid + 1] > nums[mid]) {\\n                pivot = mid;\\n                break;\\n            }\\n            else if (nums[mid] > nums[low]) {\\n                low = mid + 1;\\n            }\\n            else {\\n                high = mid - 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        if (nums[pivot] == target) return pivot;\\n\\n        low = 0;\\n        high = nums.length - 1;\\n        \\n        while (low <= high) {\\n            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n            if (nums[mid] == target) {\\n                return mid;\\n            }\\n            else if (nums[mid] < target) {\\n                low = mid + 1;\\n            }\\n            else {\\n                high = mid - 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis revised code firstly tries to find the pivot using a modified binary search. Then, it does a binary search on the entire array to find the target. This is not the most efficient solution, as the pivot is not utilized, but it corrects the issues in your original code. \\n\\nIn an optimal solution, once the pivot is found, we should do two binary searches: one from 0 to pivot, and another from pivot+1 to nums.length - 1, depending on the value of the target."

This would happen if the array is already sorted (i.e., not rotated at all), in which case the pivot function would return 0.

The while loop `while (low <= high)` can result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, as you are not checking if \\'mid\\' is at the ends of the array before accessing `nums[mid - 1]` and `nums[mid + 1]`.\\n\\n3. `if (target > pivot)` and `if (target < pivot)`: Here you\\'re comparing the target with the index \\'pivot\\', not with the value of \\'nums[pivot]\\'.\\n\\n4.

However, in both cases, you are not adjusting the mid value correctly in the while loop.\\n\\nHere is a revised version of your code:\\n\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {\\n        int low = 0;\\n        int high = nums.length - 1;\\n        int pivot = 0;\\n        \\n        while (low <= high) {\\n            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n            if (mid > 0 && mid < nums.length - 1 && nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid] && nums[mid + 1] > nums[mid]) {\\n                pivot = mid;\\n                break;\\n            }\\n            else if (nums[mid] > nums[low]) {\\n                low = mid + 1;\\n            }\\n            else {\\n                high = mid - 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        if (nums[pivot] == target) return pivot;\\n\\n        low = 0;\\n        high = nums.length - 1;\\n        \\n        while (low <= high) {\\n            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n            if (nums[mid] == target) {\\n                return mid;\\n            }\\n            else if (nums[mid] < target) {\\n                low = mid + 1;\\n            }\\n            else {\\n                high = mid - 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis revised code firstly tries to find the pivot using a modified binary search. Then, it does a binary search on the entire array to find the target. This is not the most efficient solution, as the pivot is not utilized, but it corrects the issues in your original code. \\n\\nIn an optimal solution, once the pivot is found, we should do two binary searches: one from 0 to pivot, and another from pivot+1 to nums.length - 1, depending on the value of the target."

This would happen if the array is already sorted (i.e., not rotated at all), in which case the pivot function would return 0. Accessing `nums[-1]` would result in a heap-buffer-overflow error because it tries to access memory outside the bounds of the array.\\n\\nTo fix this issue, you should add a check for the case when the array is not rotated:\\n\\n```c\\nint search(int* nums, int numsSize, int target){\\n    int pi = pivot(nums, numsSize);\\n    if (pi > 0 && target >= nums[0] && target <= nums[pi - 1]) {\\n        return binary(nums, target, 0, pi - 1);\\n    } else {\\n        return binary(nums, target, pi, numsSize - 1);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\nAlso, if the target element is not in the array, it\\'s good to handle that case.

It should be `nums.length - 1`.\\n\\n2. The while loop `while (low <= high)` can result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, as you are not checking if \\'mid\\' is at the ends of the array before accessing `nums[mid - 1]` and `nums[mid + 1]`.\\n\\n3. `if (target > pivot)` and `if (target < pivot)`: Here you\\'re comparing the target with the index \\'pivot\\', not with the value of \\'nums[pivot]\\'.\\n\\n4. In the second part of your code, you\\'re doing two binary searches, one for the case where the target is greater than the pivot value and one where it is smaller. However, in both cases, you are not adjusting the mid value correctly in the while loop.\\n\\nHere is a revised version of your code:\\n\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {\\n        int low = 0;\\n        int high = nums.length - 1;\\n        int pivot = 0;\\n        \\n        while (low <= high) {\\n            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n            if (mid > 0 && mid < nums.length - 1 && nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid] && nums[mid + 1] > nums[mid]) {\\n                pivot = mid;\\n                break;\\n            }\\n            else if (nums[mid] > nums[low]) {\\n                low = mid + 1;\\n            }\\n            else {\\n                high = mid - 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        if (nums[pivot] == target) return pivot;\\n\\n        low = 0;\\n        high = nums.length - 1;\\n        \\n        while (low <= high) {\\n            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n            if (nums[mid] == target) {\\n                return mid;\\n            }\\n            else if (nums[mid] < target) {\\n                low = mid + 1;\\n            }\\n            else {\\n                high = mid - 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis revised code firstly tries to find the pivot using a modified binary search. Then, it does a binary search on the entire array to find the target. This is not the most efficient solution, as the pivot is not utilized, but it corrects the issues in your original code. \\n\\nIn an optimal solution, once the pivot is found, we should do two binary searches: one from 0 to pivot, and another from pivot+1 to nums.length - 1, depending on the value of the target."

This would happen if the array is already sorted (i.e., not rotated at all), in which case the pivot function would return 0. Accessing `nums[-1]` would result in a heap-buffer-overflow error because it tries to access memory outside the bounds of the array.\\n\\nTo fix this issue, you should add a check for the case when the array is not rotated:\\n\\n```c\\nint search(int* nums, int numsSize, int target){\\n    int pi = pivot(nums, numsSize);\\n    if (pi > 0 && target >= nums[0] && target <= nums[pi - 1]) {\\n        return binary(nums, target, 0, pi - 1);\\n    } else {\\n        return binary(nums, target, pi, numsSize - 1);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\nAlso, if the target element is not in the array, it\\'s good to handle that case. But this is more related to the problem constraints.\\n\\nPlease try this adjustment and see if it resolves the heap-buffer-overflow error."

This not only makes the code hard to read and understand, but also prone to errors. It would be better to break these conditions down into separate if else blocks with clear comments explaining the logic.\\n\\n2. **Use of found flag:** The boolean flag \"found\" is not necessary. You can just return `mid` from within the loop when you find the target.\\n\\n3. **Variable Naming:** It would be better to name your variables according to what they represent. For example, `left` and `right` could be `low` and `high`, which might more clearly represent the lower and upper bounds of the search range.\\n\\n4. **Code Comments:** Your code lacks comments, which would be useful in explaining the logic, especially when the condition checks are complex.\\n\\nHere\\'s a simpler version of a binary search algorithm on a rotated sorted array:\\n\\n```java\\npublic int search(int[] nums, int target) {\\n    int low = 0, high = nums.length - 1;\\n    while (low <= high) {\\n        int mid = (low + high) / 2;\\n        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;\\n\\n        if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) { // left half is sorted\\n            if (nums[low] <= target && target < nums[mid]) high = mid - 1; // target is in left half\\n            else low = mid + 1; // target is in right half\\n        } \\n        else { // right half is sorted\\n            if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[high]) low = mid + 1; // target is in right half\\n            else high = mid - 1; // target is in left half\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```\\nThis code is more readable, shorter, and it accomplishes the same goal.

This means that the ideal solution is not only correct but also easy to understand.\\n\\nLet\\'s critique your solution:\\n\\n1. **Complex conditions:** The conditions inside your if and else if blocks are quite complex. This not only makes the code hard to read and understand, but also prone to errors. It would be better to break these conditions down into separate if else blocks with clear comments explaining the logic.\\n\\n2. **Use of found flag:** The boolean flag \"found\" is not necessary. You can just return `mid` from within the loop when you find the target.\\n\\n3. **Variable Naming:** It would be better to name your variables according to what they represent. For example, `left` and `right` could be `low` and `high`, which might more clearly represent the lower and upper bounds of the search range.\\n\\n4. **Code Comments:** Your code lacks comments, which would be useful in explaining the logic, especially when the condition checks are complex.\\n\\nHere\\'s a simpler version of a binary search algorithm on a rotated sorted array:\\n\\n```java\\npublic int search(int[] nums, int target) {\\n    int low = 0, high = nums.length - 1;\\n    while (low <= high) {\\n        int mid = (low + high) / 2;\\n        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;\\n\\n        if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) { // left half is sorted\\n            if (nums[low] <= target && target < nums[mid]) high = mid - 1; // target is in left half\\n            else low = mid + 1; // target is in right half\\n        } \\n        else { // right half is sorted\\n            if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[high]) low = mid + 1; // target is in right half\\n            else high = mid - 1; // target is in left half\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```\\nThis code is more readable, shorter, and it accomplishes the same goal. It divides the array into two halves, checks which half is sorted, and determines which half the target could be in. Then, it repeats the process for that half."

This means that the ideal solution is not only correct but also easy to understand.\\n\\nLet\\'s critique your solution:\\n\\n1. **Complex conditions:** The conditions inside your if and else if blocks are quite complex. This not only makes the code hard to read and understand, but also prone to errors. It would be better to break these conditions down into separate if else blocks with clear comments explaining the logic.\\n\\n2. **Use of found flag:** The boolean flag \"found\" is not necessary. You can just return `mid` from within the loop when you find the target.\\n\\n3. **Variable Naming:** It would be better to name your variables according to what they represent. For example, `left` and `right` could be `low` and `high`, which might more clearly represent the lower and upper bounds of the search range.\\n\\n4. **Code Comments:** Your code lacks comments, which would be useful in explaining the logic, especially when the condition checks are complex.\\n\\nHere\\'s a simpler version of a binary search algorithm on a rotated sorted array:\\n\\n```java\\npublic int search(int[] nums, int target) {\\n    int low = 0, high = nums.length - 1;\\n    while (low <= high) {\\n        int mid = (low + high) / 2;\\n        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;\\n\\n        if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) { // left half is sorted\\n            if (nums[low] <= target && target < nums[mid]) high = mid - 1; // target is in left half\\n            else low = mid + 1; // target is in right half\\n        } \\n        else { // right half is sorted\\n            if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[high]) low = mid + 1; // target is in right half\\n            else high = mid - 1; // target is in left half\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```\\nThis code is more readable, shorter, and it accomplishes the same goal. It divides the array into two halves, checks which half is sorted, and determines which half the target could be in. Then, it repeats the process for that half."

This means that the ideal solution is not only correct but also easy to understand.\\n\\nLet\\'s critique your solution:\\n\\n1. **Complex conditions:** The conditions inside your if and else if blocks are quite complex. This not only makes the code hard to read and understand, but also prone to errors. It would be better to break these conditions down into separate if else blocks with clear comments explaining the logic.\\n\\n2. **Use of found flag:** The boolean flag \"found\" is not necessary. You can just return `mid` from within the loop when you find the target.\\n\\n3. **Variable Naming:** It would be better to name your variables according to what they represent. For example, `left` and `right` could be `low` and `high`, which might more clearly represent the lower and upper bounds of the search range.\\n\\n4. **Code Comments:** Your code lacks comments, which would be useful in explaining the logic, especially when the condition checks are complex.\\n\\nHere\\'s a simpler version of a binary search algorithm on a rotated sorted array:\\n\\n```java\\npublic int search(int[] nums, int target) {\\n    int low = 0, high = nums.length - 1;\\n    while (low <= high) {\\n        int mid = (low + high) / 2;\\n        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;\\n\\n        if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) { // left half is sorted\\n            if (nums[low] <= target && target < nums[mid]) high = mid - 1; // target is in left half\\n            else low = mid + 1; // target is in right half\\n        } \\n        else { // right half is sorted\\n            if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[high]) low = mid + 1; // target is in right half\\n            else high = mid - 1; // target is in left half\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```\\nThis code is more readable, shorter, and it accomplishes the same goal. It divides the array into two halves, checks which half is sorted, and determines which half the target could be in. Then, it repeats the process for that half."

If it is, and the target is in the range of the left half, we continue searching in the left half; otherwise, we search in the right half.

In the array [3, 1], the pivot point is at index 0, thus making the condition `nums[start] < nums[mid]` fail when `start` and `mid` are both 0.\\n\\nThis occurs because the array is only of length 2, and the element at the `start` and `mid` index is larger than the element at the `end` index. Your code, however, expects that for the first part of the array (`nums[start]` to `nums[mid]`), it will be in sorted order. But due to the pivot at index 0, this is not the case.\\n\\nTo fix this, you can include a check for when `start` and `mid` are equal:\\n\\n```cpp\\nint search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n    int start=0;\\n    int end=nums.size()-1;\\n    while(start <= end)\\n    {\\n        int mid=(start + end)/2;\\n        if(target == nums[mid])\\n        {\\n            return mid;\\n        }\\n        if(nums[start] <= nums[mid]) // change < to <=\\n        {\\n            if(target >= nums[start] && target<nums[mid])\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        else\\n        {\\n            if(target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[end])\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```\\nThis modification handles the case where the pivot is at the start index. Now, if `start` equals `mid` and `nums[start]` is not less than `nums[mid]`, it will still check if the target is within the first half of the array. This is suitable for arrays like [3,1] where the pivot is at the start of the array."

In the worst-case scenario, this function will iterate through roughly half of the elements in the array, which gives a time complexity of O(n).\\n\\nFor example, consider a case where the target value is at the end of the unsorted half of the array. The `indexOfTarget` function will need to iterate over all elements in the unsorted half, which can be up to n/2 elements. Because we drop constants in Big O notation, the time complexity of this function is O(n), not O(n/2).\\n\\nRemember, O(log n) complexity typically implies that you\\'re dividing the problem in half (or any constant fraction) with each step, such as in a binary search. O(n) complexity implies that you have to potentially check every element, which is what the `indexOfTarget` function is doing. Despite the initial checks and divisions of the array, the linear search performed by `indexOfTarget` dominates the time complexity of your solution. \\n\\nTo achieve O(log n) complexity for this problem, you would typically perform a modified binary search, adjusting the high and low points of your search based on the target and the median value, without scanning the array linearly."

The `indexOfTarget` function will need to iterate over all elements in the unsorted half, which can be up to n/2 elements. Because we drop constants in Big O notation, the time complexity of this function is O(n), not O(n/2).\\n\\nRemember, O(log n) complexity typically implies that you\\'re dividing the problem in half (or any constant fraction) with each step, such as in a binary search. O(n) complexity implies that you have to potentially check every element, which is what the `indexOfTarget` function is doing. Despite the initial checks and divisions of the array, the linear search performed by `indexOfTarget` dominates the time complexity of your solution. \\n\\nTo achieve O(log n) complexity for this problem, you would typically perform a modified binary search, adjusting the high and low points of your search based on the target and the median value, without scanning the array linearly."

Preserving original order: Many problems require you to preserve the original order of elements in the array. Sorting the array would destroy this original order.\\n\\n2. Time complexity: As you mentioned, sorting an array has a time complexity of at least O(n log n) for most standard sorting algorithms. This could make your solution too slow if the input array is large.\\n\\n3. Space complexity: Sorting algorithms often require additional space. For example, the commonly used quicksort and mergesort algorithms are not in-place and need O(n) extra space.\\n\\n4. Problem Constraints: Sometimes, the problem statement specifically asks you not to sort the array or assumes that you\\'re working with an unsorted array.\\n\\n5. Changing the nature of the problem: Sometimes sorting an array could fundamentally change the nature of the problem you\\'re trying to solve.\\n\\nIn the context of the problem of searching in a rotated sorted array, sorting the array first would defeat the purpose of the problem. The challenge is to leverage the fact that the array is rotated and sorted to achieve a faster search time, ideally O(log n) which is possible with binary search. If you sort the array first, you would destroy the rotation and any information it might provide. Furthermore, you would still have to search through the sorted array, which would take O(log n) time with binary search, and when combined with the sorting step, would increase the overall time complexity of the solution."

Preserving original order: Many problems require you to preserve the original order of elements in the array. Sorting the array would destroy this original order.\\n\\n2. Time complexity: As you mentioned, sorting an array has a time complexity of at least O(n log n) for most standard sorting algorithms. This could make your solution too slow if the input array is large.\\n\\n3. Space complexity: Sorting algorithms often require additional space. For example, the commonly used quicksort and mergesort algorithms are not in-place and need O(n) extra space.\\n\\n4. Problem Constraints: Sometimes, the problem statement specifically asks you not to sort the array or assumes that you\\'re working with an unsorted array.\\n\\n5. Changing the nature of the problem: Sometimes sorting an array could fundamentally change the nature of the problem you\\'re trying to solve.\\n\\nIn the context of the problem of searching in a rotated sorted array, sorting the array first would defeat the purpose of the problem. The challenge is to leverage the fact that the array is rotated and sorted to achieve a faster search time, ideally O(log n) which is possible with binary search. If you sort the array first, you would destroy the rotation and any information it might provide. Furthermore, you would still have to search through the sorted array, which would take O(log n) time with binary search, and when combined with the sorting step, would increase the overall time complexity of the solution."

In the array [3, 1], the pivot point is at index 0, thus making the condition `nums[start] < nums[mid]` fail when `start` and `mid` are both 0.\\n\\nThis occurs because the array is only of length 2, and the element at the `start` and `mid` index is larger than the element at the `end` index. Your code, however, expects that for the first part of the array (`nums[start]` to `nums[mid]`), it will be in sorted order. But due to the pivot at index 0, this is not the case.\\n\\nTo fix this, you can include a check for when `start` and `mid` are equal:\\n\\n```cpp\\nint search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n    int start=0;\\n    int end=nums.size()-1;\\n    while(start <= end)\\n    {\\n        int mid=(start + end)/2;\\n        if(target == nums[mid])\\n        {\\n            return mid;\\n        }\\n        if(nums[start] <= nums[mid]) // change < to <=\\n        {\\n            if(target >= nums[start] && target<nums[mid])\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        else\\n        {\\n            if(target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[end])\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```\\nThis modification handles the case where the pivot is at the start index. Now, if `start` equals `mid` and `nums[start]` is not less than `nums[mid]`, it will still check if the target is within the first half of the array. This is suitable for arrays like [3,1] where the pivot is at the start of the array."

In the array [3, 1], the pivot point is at index 0, thus making the condition `nums[start] < nums[mid]` fail when `start` and `mid` are both 0.\\n\\nThis occurs because the array is only of length 2, and the element at the `start` and `mid` index is larger than the element at the `end` index. Your code, however, expects that for the first part of the array (`nums[start]` to `nums[mid]`), it will be in sorted order. But due to the pivot at index 0, this is not the case.\\n\\nTo fix this, you can include a check for when `start` and `mid` are equal:\\n\\n```cpp\\nint search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n    int start=0;\\n    int end=nums.size()-1;\\n    while(start <= end)\\n    {\\n        int mid=(start + end)/2;\\n        if(target == nums[mid])\\n        {\\n            return mid;\\n        }\\n        if(nums[start] <= nums[mid]) // change < to <=\\n        {\\n            if(target >= nums[start] && target<nums[mid])\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        else\\n        {\\n            if(target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[end])\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```\\nThis modification handles the case where the pivot is at the start index. Now, if `start` equals `mid` and `nums[start]` is not less than `nums[mid]`, it will still check if the target is within the first half of the array. This is suitable for arrays like [3,1] where the pivot is at the start of the array."

In the worst-case scenario, this function will iterate through roughly half of the elements in the array, which gives a time complexity of O(n).\\n\\nFor example, consider a case where the target value is at the end of the unsorted half of the array. The `indexOfTarget` function will need to iterate over all elements in the unsorted half, which can be up to n/2 elements. Because we drop constants in Big O notation, the time complexity of this function is O(n), not O(n/2).\\n\\nRemember, O(log n) complexity typically implies that you\\'re dividing the problem in half (or any constant fraction) with each step, such as in a binary search. O(n) complexity implies that you have to potentially check every element, which is what the `indexOfTarget` function is doing. Despite the initial checks and divisions of the array, the linear search performed by `indexOfTarget` dominates the time complexity of your solution. \\n\\nTo achieve O(log n) complexity for this problem, you would typically perform a modified binary search, adjusting the high and low points of your search based on the target and the median value, without scanning the array linearly."

The `indexOfTarget` function will need to iterate over all elements in the unsorted half, which can be up to n/2 elements. Because we drop constants in Big O notation, the time complexity of this function is O(n), not O(n/2).\\n\\nRemember, O(log n) complexity typically implies that you\\'re dividing the problem in half (or any constant fraction) with each step, such as in a binary search. O(n) complexity implies that you have to potentially check every element, which is what the `indexOfTarget` function is doing. Despite the initial checks and divisions of the array, the linear search performed by `indexOfTarget` dominates the time complexity of your solution. \\n\\nTo achieve O(log n) complexity for this problem, you would typically perform a modified binary search, adjusting the high and low points of your search based on the target and the median value, without scanning the array linearly."

Preserving original order: Many problems require you to preserve the original order of elements in the array. Sorting the array would destroy this original order.\\n\\n2. Time complexity: As you mentioned, sorting an array has a time complexity of at least O(n log n) for most standard sorting algorithms. This could make your solution too slow if the input array is large.\\n\\n3. Space complexity: Sorting algorithms often require additional space. For example, the commonly used quicksort and mergesort algorithms are not in-place and need O(n) extra space.\\n\\n4. Problem Constraints: Sometimes, the problem statement specifically asks you not to sort the array or assumes that you\\'re working with an unsorted array.\\n\\n5. Changing the nature of the problem: Sometimes sorting an array could fundamentally change the nature of the problem you\\'re trying to solve.\\n\\nIn the context of the problem of searching in a rotated sorted array, sorting the array first would defeat the purpose of the problem. The challenge is to leverage the fact that the array is rotated and sorted to achieve a faster search time, ideally O(log n) which is possible with binary search. If you sort the array first, you would destroy the rotation and any information it might provide. Furthermore, you would still have to search through the sorted array, which would take O(log n) time with binary search, and when combined with the sorting step, would increase the overall time complexity of the solution."

Preserving original order: Many problems require you to preserve the original order of elements in the array. Sorting the array would destroy this original order.\\n\\n2. Time complexity: As you mentioned, sorting an array has a time complexity of at least O(n log n) for most standard sorting algorithms. This could make your solution too slow if the input array is large.\\n\\n3. Space complexity: Sorting algorithms often require additional space. For example, the commonly used quicksort and mergesort algorithms are not in-place and need O(n) extra space.\\n\\n4. Problem Constraints: Sometimes, the problem statement specifically asks you not to sort the array or assumes that you\\'re working with an unsorted array.\\n\\n5. Changing the nature of the problem: Sometimes sorting an array could fundamentally change the nature of the problem you\\'re trying to solve.\\n\\nIn the context of the problem of searching in a rotated sorted array, sorting the array first would defeat the purpose of the problem. The challenge is to leverage the fact that the array is rotated and sorted to achieve a faster search time, ideally O(log n) which is possible with binary search. If you sort the array first, you would destroy the rotation and any information it might provide. Furthermore, you would still have to search through the sorted array, which would take O(log n) time with binary search, and when combined with the sorting step, would increase the overall time complexity of the solution."

In the array [3, 1], the pivot point is at index 0, thus making the condition `nums[start] < nums[mid]` fail when `start` and `mid` are both 0.\\n\\nThis occurs because the array is only of length 2, and the element at the `start` and `mid` index is larger than the element at the `end` index. Your code, however, expects that for the first part of the array (`nums[start]` to `nums[mid]`), it will be in sorted order. But due to the pivot at index 0, this is not the case.\\n\\nTo fix this, you can include a check for when `start` and `mid` are equal:\\n\\n```cpp\\nint search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n    int start=0;\\n    int end=nums.size()-1;\\n    while(start <= end)\\n    {\\n        int mid=(start + end)/2;\\n        if(target == nums[mid])\\n        {\\n            return mid;\\n        }\\n        if(nums[start] <= nums[mid]) // change < to <=\\n        {\\n            if(target >= nums[start] && target<nums[mid])\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        else\\n        {\\n            if(target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[end])\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```\\nThis modification handles the case where the pivot is at the start index. Now, if `start` equals `mid` and `nums[start]` is not less than `nums[mid]`, it will still check if the target is within the first half of the array. This is suitable for arrays like [3,1] where the pivot is at the start of the array."

In the array [3, 1], the pivot point is at index 0, thus making the condition `nums[start] < nums[mid]` fail when `start` and `mid` are both 0.\\n\\nThis occurs because the array is only of length 2, and the element at the `start` and `mid` index is larger than the element at the `end` index. Your code, however, expects that for the first part of the array (`nums[start]` to `nums[mid]`), it will be in sorted order. But due to the pivot at index 0, this is not the case.\\n\\nTo fix this, you can include a check for when `start` and `mid` are equal:\\n\\n```cpp\\nint search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n    int start=0;\\n    int end=nums.size()-1;\\n    while(start <= end)\\n    {\\n        int mid=(start + end)/2;\\n        if(target == nums[mid])\\n        {\\n            return mid;\\n        }\\n        if(nums[start] <= nums[mid]) // change < to <=\\n        {\\n            if(target >= nums[start] && target<nums[mid])\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        else\\n        {\\n            if(target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[end])\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```\\nThis modification handles the case where the pivot is at the start index. Now, if `start` equals `mid` and `nums[start]` is not less than `nums[mid]`, it will still check if the target is within the first half of the array. This is suitable for arrays like [3,1] where the pivot is at the start of the array."

In the worst-case scenario, this function will iterate through roughly half of the elements in the array, which gives a time complexity of O(n).\\n\\nFor example, consider a case where the target value is at the end of the unsorted half of the array. The `indexOfTarget` function will need to iterate over all elements in the unsorted half, which can be up to n/2 elements. Because we drop constants in Big O notation, the time complexity of this function is O(n), not O(n/2).\\n\\nRemember, O(log n) complexity typically implies that you\\'re dividing the problem in half (or any constant fraction) with each step, such as in a binary search. O(n) complexity implies that you have to potentially check every element, which is what the `indexOfTarget` function is doing. Despite the initial checks and divisions of the array, the linear search performed by `indexOfTarget` dominates the time complexity of your solution. \\n\\nTo achieve O(log n) complexity for this problem, you would typically perform a modified binary search, adjusting the high and low points of your search based on the target and the median value, without scanning the array linearly."

In the array [3, 1], the pivot point is at index 0, thus making the condition `nums[start] < nums[mid]` fail when `start` and `mid` are both 0.\\n\\nThis occurs because the array is only of length 2, and the element at the `start` and `mid` index is larger than the element at the `end` index. Your code, however, expects that for the first part of the array (`nums[start]` to `nums[mid]`), it will be in sorted order. But due to the pivot at index 0, this is not the case.\\n\\nTo fix this, you can include a check for when `start` and `mid` are equal:\\n\\n```cpp\\nint search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\\n    int start=0;\\n    int end=nums.size()-1;\\n    while(start <= end)\\n    {\\n        int mid=(start + end)/2;\\n        if(target == nums[mid])\\n        {\\n            return mid;\\n        }\\n        if(nums[start] <= nums[mid]) // change < to <=\\n        {\\n            if(target >= nums[start] && target<nums[mid])\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        else\\n        {\\n            if(target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[end])\\n            {\\n                start=mid+1;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                end=mid-1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```\\nThis modification handles the case where the pivot is at the start index. Now, if `start` equals `mid` and `nums[start]` is not less than `nums[mid]`, it will still check if the target is within the first half of the array. This is suitable for arrays like [3,1] where the pivot is at the start of the array."

In the worst-case scenario, this function will iterate through roughly half of the elements in the array, which gives a time complexity of O(n).\\n\\nFor example, consider a case where the target value is at the end of the unsorted half of the array. The `indexOfTarget` function will need to iterate over all elements in the unsorted half, which can be up to n/2 elements. Because we drop constants in Big O notation, the time complexity of this function is O(n), not O(n/2).\\n\\nRemember, O(log n) complexity typically implies that you\\'re dividing the problem in half (or any constant fraction) with each step, such as in a binary search. O(n) complexity implies that you have to potentially check every element, which is what the `indexOfTarget` function is doing. Despite the initial checks and divisions of the array, the linear search performed by `indexOfTarget` dominates the time complexity of your solution. \\n\\nTo achieve O(log n) complexity for this problem, you would typically perform a modified binary search, adjusting the high and low points of your search based on the target and the median value, without scanning the array linearly."

After finding the smallest element, you need to check whether the target is in the first half or the second half of the rotated array and search in the correct half.

You should compare the target with `nums[0]` instead of `nums[high]` because `nums[0]` would be the starting point of either of the sorted halves of the array.\\n\\n2. In the second while loop, you\\'re using `while(i<j)`. But you should use `while(i<=j)` to ensure the loop runs when `i` and `j` point to the same element.\\n\\n3.

After finding the smallest element, you need to check whether the target is in the first half or the second half of the rotated array and search in the correct half. However, in your code, you\\'re defining the boundaries `i` and `j` incorrectly. You should compare the target with `nums[0]` instead of `nums[high]` because `nums[0]` would be the starting point of either of the sorted halves of the array.\\n\\n2. In the second while loop, you\\'re using `while(i<j)`. But you should use `while(i<=j)` to ensure the loop runs when `i` and `j` point to the same element.\\n\\n3. In the return statement, you\\'re returning `j`, which is not correct.

After finding the smallest element, you need to check whether the target is in the first half or the second half of the rotated array and search in the correct half.

Recursive dfs, which is a bit simpler to code, but be careful if you have very deep graphs.\\n3. bfs - only iterative, there is no recursion version, because we use queue, not stack here.\\n\\nHere I choose method number 2 (because it is easy to code of course)\\n\\nLet us create global dictionary `mapping`, which will connect nodes from old graph with nodes from new graph and use recursive `dfs` function to construct these connections:\\n1. First, add connection `mapping[node] = Node(node.val)`\\n2. Traverse all neighbors of node and if node is not traversed, that is it is not in our `mapping`, then we run `dfs` for this neighbor. Also we add connection in new graph (we add it even if node is visited!)\\n\\n**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(E)`: this number of iterations we need for full dfs traversal.

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe problem requires us to perform a deep copy (clone) of the given graph. In a deep copy, we need to create a new instance of the graph that is independent of the original graph, and each of its nodes should have their copy.\\n\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nTo create a deep copy of a graph, we need to perform a traversal of the original graph and create a copy of each node we visit. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach for traversal of the graph. To ensure that we do not visit the same node twice, we can use a visited set.\\n\\nWe will start by creating an empty dictionary, where the keys will be the nodes of the original graph, and the values will be the corresponding nodes of the new graph. We can then use DFS to traverse the original graph and create the new graph. For each node, we create a copy of it and add it to the dictionary. We then recursively create the copies of all the neighbors of the node and add them to the neighbors list of the copy.\\n\\nTo ensure that we do not visit the same node twice, we can use a visited set to keep track of the nodes we have already visited.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe time complexity of this approach is O(N+E), where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges in the graph. We traverse each node and edge once, and each operation takes O(1) time.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe space complexity of this approach is also O(N+E). We use a dictionary to store the copies of the nodes, which takes O(N) space. We also use a visited set, which takes O(N) space in the worst case. Additionally, we need to store the neighbors of each node, which takes O(E) space.\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b427e686-2e5d-469a-8e7a-db5140022a6b_1677715904.0948765.png)\\n\\n\\n# Please Upvote\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\n```\\nThanks for visiting my solution.\\uD83D\\uDE0A Keep Learning\\nPlease give my solution an upvote! \\uD83D\\uDC4D\\nIt\\'s a simple way to show your appreciation and\\nkeep me motivated.

For each neighbor of the current node, we check if we have already visited it or not.\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {\\n        map<Node*,Node*>m;\\n        \\n        if(node == NULL)\\n        {\\n            return NULL;\\n        }\\n\\n        // make clone of root node\\n        Node* root = new Node(node->val);\\n        m[node] = root;\\n\\n        queue<Node*>q;\\n        q.push(node);\\n\\n        while(!q.empty())\\n        {\\n            Node* curr = q.front();\\n            q.pop();\\n\\n            // we traverse through neighbors of original node\\n            for(Node* it : c->neighbors)\\n            {\\n                // if duplicate node of current node is present then we make a new one \\n                // and also add it in map and queue as it is not visited previously\\n                if(m.find(it) == m.end())\\n                {\\n                    Node* k = new Node(it->val);\\n                    m[it] = k;\\n                    q.push(it);\\n                }\\n                // connect duplicate node with its duplicate neighbors.\\n                m[c] -> neighbors.push_back(m[it]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return m[node];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n![e2515d84-99cf-4499-80fb-fe458e1bbae2_1678932606.8004954.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/36bf0cb9-9dc3-4377-9ae3-233a71916dad_1680912111.7851627.png)\\n",

                "content": "This is a pretty straightforward solution, if you have some familiarity with a DFS approach; but I enjoyed how elegantly it all came together - and I think that is important to write code you like to read and use, as it helps you boost your confidence and makes other people more willingly read and use it as well :)\\n\\nFirst of all, in order to proceed, we can create `nodes`, an array of `Node` pointers, all with `NULL` value (I used `0` here just to make things more concise); noticee that we created `101` elements since the we know we will have up to `100` different nodes, each with a value matching its order; I might have created one less cell in the array, but this small memory consumption saves us the hassle of converting all the 1-indexed values into 0-indexed positions.\\n\\nThen in our core function we just check if `node` is not `NULL`:\\n* if it is, we move on and just return `nodes[1]`, which would similarly be `NULL`;\\n* if it is not, we call `createNode` passing `node` as a sole parameter - this will populate `nodes` and, then again, we can return `nodes[1]`.\\n\\nBut how does `createNode` behaves?\\n\\nFirst of all checks if we already had that node that we want to create - ie: the value of `nodes` at position `originalNode->val` is not `NULL`. If it is not there yet, we create it.\\n\\nThen, knowing that now we have it for sure, we proceed to populate it with neighbours (and I had my code falling again, since I keep using the UK spelling for it: I will never learn to unlearn it <_<) for every neighbour of `originalNode`, we first of all check if we already have it, otherwise we will create it.\\n\\nNotice that we are not using the `new` constructor here: we are creating it with recursive calls to `createNode`, so that the missing node will be not just created, but also recursively populated with all its neighbours, same for the neighbours of its neighbours and so on.\\n\\nNow that again we are sure the neighbouring node exist, we just push it in the `->neighbors` property of the node we just created at the previous step and we are done :)\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    // our initial blank slate\\n    Node* nodes[101] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};\\n    void createNode(Node *originalNode) {\\n        // checking if we already created that node\\n\\t\\tif (!nodes[originalNode->val]) {\\n            nodes[originalNode->val] = new Node(originalNode->val);\\n        }\\n\\t\\t// adding neighbours\\n        for (auto n: originalNode->neighbors) {\\n            // checking if the neighbour exist, otherwise we create it\\n            if (!nodes[n->val]) createNode(n);\\n            // adding the neighbour\\n            nodes[originalNode->val]->neighbors.push_back(nodes[n->val]);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {\\n        if (node) createNode(node);\\n        return nodes[1];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAlternative version that has `createNode` actually returning new nodes - for some reason that eludes me at the moment (the compiler properly optimising tail recursion, maybe?) this performed a bit better than the previous:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    // our initial blank slate\\n    Node* nodes[101] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};\\n    Node* createNode(Node *originalNode) {\\n        // checking if we already created that node\\n\\t\\tif (!nodes[originalNode->val]) {\\n            nodes[originalNode->val] = new Node(originalNode->val);\\n        }\\n\\t\\t// adding neighbours\\n        for (auto n: originalNode->neighbors) {\\n            // checking if the neighbour exist, otherwise we create it\\n            if (!nodes[n->val]) nodes[n->val] = createNode(n);\\n            // adding the neighbour\\n            nodes[originalNode->val]->neighbors.push_back(nodes[n->val]);\\n        }\\n        return nodes[originalNode->val];\\n    }\\n    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {\\n        if (node) nodes[1] = createNode(node);\\n        return nodes[1];\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

If not, we create a copy of it and add it to the hashmap and the queue.\\n- Finally, we connect the copy nodes of each neighbor to the copy node of the current node.\\n- Once we have visited all nodes and created their copies, we return the copy of the original node.\\n\\n# Intuition:\\n\\n- The problem requires us to create a deep copy of the given graph, where each node in the new graph has the same value as the corresponding node in the original graph, but is a separate instance.\\n- We can achieve this by traversing the graph in a BFS manner and creating a copy of each node we visit.\\n- To ensure that we don\\'t create duplicate copies of the same node, we can use a hashmap to keep track of visited nodes and their copies.\\n- Since the graph can have cycles, we need to use a hashmap to ensure that we don\\'t get stuck in an infinite loop while traversing the graph.\\n- Once we have created the copies of all nodes and connected them in the same way as the original graph, we return the copy of the original node.\\n\\n\\n```Python []\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    \\n\\n  def cloneGraph(self, node):\\n      if not node:\\n          return None\\n\\n      visited = {}\\n      queue = deque([node])\\n\\n      # Create a copy of the starting node and add it to visited\\n      visited[node] = Node(node.val)\\n\\n      while queue:\\n          # Get the next node from the queue\\n          curr_node = queue.popleft()\\n\\n          # Loop through the current node\\'s neighbors\\n          for neighbor in curr_node.neighbors:\\n              if neighbor not in visited:\\n                  # Create a copy of the neighbor and add it to visited\\n                  visited[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val)\\n                  queue.append(neighbor)\\n\\n              # Add the copy of the neighbor to the copy of the current node\\'s neighbors\\n              visited[curr_node].neighbors.append(visited[neighbor])\\n\\n      return visited[node]\\n\\n```\\n```Java []\\n\\nclass Solution {\\n    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {\\n        if (node == null) {\\n            return null;\\n        }\\n\\n        HashMap<Node, Node> visited = new HashMap<>();\\n        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();\\n\\n        // Create a copy of the starting node and add it to visited\\n        visited.put(node, new Node(node.val));\\n\\n        queue.offer(node);\\n\\n        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {\\n            // Get the next node from the queue\\n            Node currNode = queue.poll();\\n\\n            // Loop through the current node\\'s neighbors\\n            for (Node neighbor : currNode.neighbors) {\\n                if (!visited.containsKey(neighbor)) {\\n                    // Create a copy of the neighbor and add it to visited\\n                    visited.put(neighbor, new Node(neighbor.val));\\n                    queue.offer(neighbor);\\n                }\\n\\n                // Add the copy of the neighbor to the copy of the current node\\'s neighbors\\n                visited.get(currNode).neighbors.add(visited.get(neighbor));\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return visited.get(node);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n```C++ []\\n/**\\n * Definition for a Node.\\n * struct Node {\\n *     int val;\\n *     vector<Node*> neighbors;\\n *     Node(int val) {\\n *         this->val = val;\\n *         neighbors = vector<Node*>();\\n *     }\\n * };\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {\\n        if (!node) {\\n            return nullptr;\\n        }\\n\\n        unordered_map<Node*, Node*> visited;\\n        queue<Node*> q;\\n\\n        // Create a copy of the starting node and add it to visited\\n        visited[node] = new Node(node->val);\\n\\n        q.push(node);\\n\\n        while (!q.empty()) {\\n            // Get the next node from the queue\\n            Node* currNode = q.front();\\n            q.pop();\\n\\n            // Loop through the current node\\'s neighbors\\n            for (Node* neighbor : currNode->neighbors) {\\n                if (!visited.count(neighbor)) {\\n                    // Create a copy of the neighbor and add it to visited\\n                    visited[neighbor] = new Node(neighbor->val);\\n                    q.push(neighbor);\\n                }\\n\\n                // Add the copy of the neighbor to the copy of the current node\\'s neighbors\\n                visited[currNode]->neighbors.push_back(visited[neighbor]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return visited[node];\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/e2515d84-99cf-4499-80fb-fe458e1bbae2_1678932606.8004954.png)\\n\\n# Please UPVOTE \\uD83D\\uDC4D",

                "content": "Here are two algorithms, BFS and DFS, for solving the deep copy (clone) of a graph in JavaScript and PHP.\\n\\n#### DFS Approach for Cloning a Graph\\n\\nThis approach uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to clone a graph. \\nIt first creates a new node and adds it to a visited map. \\nThen it iterates over the node\\'s neighbors, creating a new node for each one if it is not already in the visited map. \\nFinally, it adds the new node to the neighbors of the new node. \\n\\n- *Time complexity* is $$O(V+E)$$ where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph, as the algorithm iterates over all the vertices and edges once. \\n- *Space complexity* is $$O(V)$$, as the visited map contains at most V amount of nodes.\\n\\n\\n```javascript []\\n// DFS approach\\nvar cloneGraph = function (node) {\\n    // DFS approach\\n    // 1. create a new node\\n    // 2. add the new node to the visited map\\n    // 3. for each neighbor of the node\\n    // 4.    if the neighbor is not in the visited map\\n    // 5.        create a new node\\n    // 6.        add the new node to the visited map\\n    // 7.    add the new node to the neighbors of the new node\\n    if (!node) return null;\\n\\n    let dfs = (node, visited) => {\\n        if (visited.has(node)) return visited.get(node);\\n        let newNode = new Node(node.val);\\n        visited.set(node, newNode);\\n        for (let neighbor of node.neighbors) {\\n            newNode.neighbors.push(dfs(neighbor, visited));\\n        }\\n        return newNode;\\n    }\\n    return dfs(node, new Map());\\n}\\n```\\n```php []\\n// DFS Approach\\nclass Solution\\n{\\n    function cloneGraph(?Node $node): ?Node {\\n        if ($node === null) return null;\\n        $visited = [];\\n        return $this->cloneGraphHelper($node, $visited);\\n    }\\n\\n    function cloneGraphHelper(?Node $node, array &$visited): ?Node {\\n        if (isset($visited[$node->val])) {\\n            return $visited[$node->val];\\n        }\\n        $newNode = new Node($node->val);\\n        $visited[$node->val] = $newNode;\\n        foreach ($node->neighbors as $neighbor) {\\n            $newNode->neighbors[] = $this->cloneGraphHelper($neighbor, $visited);\\n        }\\n        return $newNode;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### BFS Approach to Cloning a Graph\\nThis approach uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to clone a graph. \\nThe algorithm begins by creating a new node with the same value as the original node. \\nIt then adds the original node to a queue, and adds a mapping of the node to the new node to a visited map. \\nIt then loops through the queue, shifting off the first node in the queue each time. For each of the shifted node\\'s neighbors, the algorithm checks to see if the neighbor has been visited. \\nIf it hasn\\'t been, then a new node is created and added to the queue, and the neighbor is added to the visited map. \\nLastly, the new node\\'s neighbors array is updated with the new mapped node. Once the queue is empty, the new node is returned.\\n\\n- *Time complexity*: $$O(V + E)$$, where V is the number of nodes in the graph and E is the number of edges in the graph.\\n- *Space complexity*: $$O(V)$$, where V is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because the visited map and queue are both of size V.\\n\\n\\n```javascript []\\n// BFS approach\\nvar cloneGraph = function (node) {\\n    // BFS approach\\n    // 1. create a new node\\n    // 2. add the new node to the queue\\n    // 3. add the new node to the visited map\\n    // 4. while the queue is not empty\\n    // 5.    get the first node from the queue\\n    // 6.    for each neighbor of the node\\n    // 7.        if the neighbor is not in the visited map\\n    // 8.            create a new node\\n    // 9.            add the new node to the queue\\n    // 10.           add the new node to the visited map\\n    // 11.       add the new node to the neighbors of the new node\\n    if (!node) return null;\\n\\n    let newNode = new Node(node.val);\\n    let queue = [node];\\n    let visited = new Map();\\n    visited.set(node, newNode);\\n\\n    while (queue.length > 0) {\\n        let currentNode = queue.shift();\\n        for (let neighbor of currentNode.neighbors) {\\n            if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {\\n                let newNeighbor = new Node(neighbor.val);\\n                queue.push(neighbor);\\n                visited.set(neighbor, newNeighbor);\\n            }\\n            visited.get(currentNode).neighbors.push(visited.get(neighbor));\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return newNode;\\n};\\n```\\n```php []\\nclass Solution\\n{\\n    function cloneGraph(?Node $node): ?Node {\\n        if ($node === null) return null;\\n        $visited = [];\\n        $queue = new SplQueue();\\n        $queue->enqueue($node);\\n        $visited[$node->val] = new Node($node->val);\\n        while (!$queue->isEmpty()) {\\n            $current = $queue->dequeue();\\n            foreach ($current->neighbors as $neighbor) {\\n                if (!isset($visited[$neighbor->val])) {\\n                    $visited[$neighbor->val] = new Node($neighbor->val);\\n                    $queue->enqueue($neighbor);\\n                }\\n                $visited[$current->val]->neighbors[] = $visited[$neighbor->val];\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return $visited[$node->val];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n##### Thanks for reading!

YOU WILL DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE CODE LINE BY LINE AFTER SEEING THE APPROACH.**\\n\\n# Intuition of this Problem :\\n*This problem is about cloning a given connected undirected graph. Given a reference to a node in the graph, we need to create a deep copy of the entire graph.*\\n\\n*To accomplish this, we can use DFS traversal of the input graph, starting from the given node, and create a new copy of each node and its neighbors. We can use a map to keep track of nodes that have already been cloned so that we don\\'t create duplicate nodes.*\\n\\n*During the DFS traversal, we create a new node for each node that we visit, and we add this node to our map. We then recursively visit all of the node\\'s neighbors and create a new node for each neighbor, adding them to the current node\\'s list of neighbors. If a neighbor has already been cloned, we simply add a reference to the cloned neighbor to the current node\\'s list of neighbors.*\\n\\n*Once we have finished traversing the entire graph, we will have created a deep copy of the input graph. Finally, we return a reference to the cloned node that was provided as input.*\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n\\n# Approach for this Problem :\\n1. Initialize an empty unordered map to keep track of nodes that have already been cloned.\\n2. Check if the input node is null. If it is, return null.\\n3. Check if the input node already exists in the map. If it does, return its corresponding clone.\\n4.

We can achieve this by using a HashMap to keep track of the nodes we have visited and their corresponding cloned nodes.\\n\\nWe start by cloning the first node (with value 1) and adding it to the HashMap. We then perform a Depth First Search (DFS) on the graph, starting at the first node. For each neighbor of a node that we encounter, we check if it has already been visited. If it has not, we create a new clone node and add it to the HashMap, and then add it to the neighbors list of the cloned node that we are currently visiting. We then recursively perform DFS on the neighbor. If the neighbor has already been visited, we simply add its corresponding cloned node to the neighbors list of the cloned node that we are currently visiting.\\n\\nAfter we have visited all the nodes in the graph, we return the cloned node with value 1.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N+E), where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges in the graph, because we visit each node and edge once during the DFS traversal.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity is also O(N+E), because we use a dictionary to store the cloned nodes and a recursion stack to perform the DFS traversal.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def cloneGraph(self, node: \\'Node\\') -> \\'Node\\':\\n        if not node:\\n            return node\\n        \\n        visited = {} # dictionary to store the cloned nodes\\n        \\n        def dfs(node):\\n            if node in visited:\\n                return visited[node] # if node already visited, return the corresponding cloned node\\n            \\n            clone_node = Node(node.val, []) # create a new clone node\\n            \\n            visited[node] = clone_node # add the original node and its clone to the dictionary\\n            \\n            for neighbor in node.neighbors: # visit all the neighbors of the node\\n                clone_node.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor)) # if neighbor not visited, create a new clone node and append to the neighbors list of the clone node we are currently visiting. Otherwise, append the corresponding cloned node to the neighbors list.\\n            \\n            return clone_node\\n        \\n        return dfs(node) # start DFS from the first node and return its clone\\n\\n```",

Recursive DFS solution using built-in stack\\n---\\nHere and below, V and E refer to the number of vertices and edges in a graph G = (V, E), respectively.\\n### Time complexity: O(V + E), because we need to visit all vertices and traverse all edges in the graph.\\n### Space complexity: O(V), because the worst case is when we have a complete graph (i.e. there\\'s an edge between every pair of vertices), in which the depth of the recursion stack would be the number of nodes in the graph.\\n\\nTo construct the clone graph, we need to traverse through the original graph and generate the copy nodes at the same time. To allow us to be able to form the edge connections properly, we need a mapping that lets us know what the original edge connections/relationships were in the original graph. Hence why we\\'re using a map to map nodes in the original graph to nodes in the copy graph. Since the graph is undirected, whenever there\\'s an edge from A -> B, there\\'s also one from B -> A. Thus, to not get caught in an infinite loop, the visited map serves the dual purpose of allowing us to keep track of which nodes we\\'ve already visited, so that we don\\'t visit them yet again.\\n\\n```python\\n\"\"\"\\nDefinition for a Node.\\nclass Node:\\n    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):\\n        self.val = val\\n        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []\\n\"\"\"\\nclass Solution:\\n    def cloneGraph(self, node: \\'Node\\') -> \\'Node\\':\\n        if node == None:\\n            return node\\n\\n        visited = {}\\n\\n        def dfs(node):\\n            if node in visited:\\n                return visited[node]\\n\\n            clone = Node(node.val)\\n            visited[node] = clone\\n\\n            for neighbor in node.neighbors:\\n                visited[node].neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))\\n\\n            return clone\\n\\n        return dfs(node)\\n\\n```\\n## 2. Iterative DFS solution with user-managed stack\\n---\\n### Time complexity: O(V + E)\\n### Space complexity: O(V)\\n\\nThe iterative version is essentially the same as the recursive version, with the only difference being that we have to manage the stack ourselves.\\n```python\\n\"\"\"\\nDefinition for a Node.\\nclass Node:\\n  def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):\\n    self.val = val\\n    self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []\\n\"\"\"\\nclass Solution:\\n    def cloneGraph(self, node: \\'Node\\') -> \\'Node\\':\\n        if node == None:\\n            return node\\n\\n        visited = {node: Node(node.val)}\\n        stack = [node]\\n\\n        while len(stack) > 0:\\n            curr = stack.pop()\\n\\n            for neighbor in curr.neighbors:\\n                if neighbor not in visited:\\n                    visited[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val)\\n                    stack.append(neighbor)\\n\\n                visited[curr].neighbors.append(visited[neighbor])\\n\\n        return visited[node]\\n\\n```\\n\\n## 3. Iterative BFS solution with queue\\n---\\n### Time complexity: O(V + E)\\n### Space complexity: O(V)\\n\\nSurprisingly, the iterative BFS version looks nearly identical to the iterative DFS version, with only two lines of difference. Since our graph is connected, it doesn\\'t matter whether we visit vertices in breadth-first or depth-first order; either is guaranteed to visit all the nodes and thus copy the original graph. That explains why the two solutions are so similar.\\n\\n```python\\n\"\"\"\\nDefinition for a Node.\\nclass Node:\\n  def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):\\n    self.val = val\\n    self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []\\n\"\"\"\\nclass Solution:\\n    def cloneGraph(self, node: \\'Node\\') -> \\'Node\\':\\n        if node == None:\\n            return node\\n\\n        visited = {node: Node(node.val)}\\n        queue = deque([node])\\n\\n        while len(queue) > 0:\\n            curr = queue.popleft()\\n\\n            for neighbor in curr.neighbors:\\n                if neighbor not in visited:\\n                    visited[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val)\\n                    queue.append(neighbor)\\n\\n                visited[curr].neighbors.append(visited[neighbor])\\n\\n        return visited[node]\\n\\n```\\n",

A map is used to keep track of the nodes that have already been cloned. This helps to avoid creating duplicate copies of nodes and ensures that the cloned graph is identical to the original.\\n\\n# Approach\\nThe dfs function takes a node pointer and the map as input and returns the cloned node pointer. It creates a new node with the same value as the input node and adds it to the map. Then, it iterates through the input node\\'s neighbors and recursively calls the dfs function for each neighbor. If a neighbor has already been cloned, it retrieves the cloned neighbor from the map; otherwise, it creates a new cloned neighbor using the dfs function. The cloned neighbors are added to a vector and assigned to the cloned node\\'s neighbors field. Finally, the cloned node pointer is returned.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:`O(V+E)`\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:`O(V)`\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def dfs(self, node, ump):\\n        neighbour = []\\n        clone = Node(node.val)\\n        ump[node] = clone\\n        for it in node.neighbors:\\n            if it not in ump:\\n                neighbour.append(self.dfs(it, ump))\\n            else:\\n                neighbour.append(ump[it])\\n        clone.neighbors = neighbour\\n        return clone\\n\\n    def cloneGraph(self, node: \\'Node\\') -> \\'Node\\':\\n        if not node:\\n            return node\\n        ump = {}\\n        if not node.neighbors:\\n            clone = Node(node.val)\\n            return clone\\n        return self.dfs(node, ump)\\n\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\nprivate:\\n    Node* dfs(Node* node,unordered_map<Node*,Node*>& ump){\\n        vector<Node*>neighbour;\\n        Node* clone = new Node(node->val);\\n        ump[node] = clone;\\n        for(auto it:node->neighbors){\\n            if(ump.find(it)==ump.end()){\\n                neighbour.push_back(dfs(it,ump));\\n            }\\n            else{\\n                neighbour.push_back(ump[it]);\\n            }\\n            \\n        }\\n        clone->neighbors = neighbour;\\n        return clone;\\n    }\\npublic:\\n    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {\\n        if(node == nullptr)\\n            return node;\\n        unordered_map<Node*, Node*>ump;\\n        //To find the neighbours present or not in constant time\\n        if(node->neighbors.size()==0){\\n            Node * clone = new Node(node->val);\\n            return clone;\\n        }\\n        return dfs(node,ump);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    private Node dfs(Node node, Map<Node, Node> ump) {\\n        List<Node> neighbour = new ArrayList<>();\\n        Node clone = new Node(node.val);\\n        ump.put(node, clone);\\n        for(Node it:node.neighbors){\\n            if(!ump.containsKey(it)) {\\n                neighbour.add(dfs(it, ump));\\n            } else {\\n                neighbour.add(ump.get(it));\\n            }\\n        }\\n        clone.neighbors = neighbour;\\n        return clone;\\n    }\\n    \\n    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {\\n        if(node == null) {\\n            return node;\\n        }\\n        Map<Node, Node> ump = new HashMap<>();\\n        if(node.neighbors.size() == 0) {\\n            Node clone = new Node(node.val);\\n            return clone;\\n        }\\n        return dfs(node, ump);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n# BFS APPROACH\\n# Intuition\\nThe algorithm uses a queue to traverse the graph in a breadth-first search manner. The algorithm first checks if the input node is null, in which case it returns null. Otherwise, it creates an unordered map (ump) to store the mapping between the original nodes and the corresponding cloned nodes.\\n\\n# Approach\\nThe algorithm starts by cloning the input node and adding it to the queue. Then, it starts a while loop that runs until the queue is empty. In each iteration of the loop, the algorithm dequeues a node from the front of the queue and for each neighbor of that node, it checks if it has already been cloned or not. If it hasn\\'t been cloned, the algorithm creates a new node with the same value as the neighbor, adds it to the queue, and creates an edge from the cloned node to the new node. Finally, it updates the ump map with the mapping between the original node and the new node.\\n\\nOnce the while loop has finished, the algorithm returns the cloned node corresponding to the input node.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:`O(V+E)`\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:`O(V+E)`\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def cloneGraph(self, node: \\'Node\\') -> \\'Node\\':\\n        if not node:\\n            return node\\n        ump = {}\\n        # To find the neighbours present or not in constant time\\n\\n        qu = collections.deque()\\n        # For bfs traversal\\n        ump[node] = Node(node.val, [])\\n        qu.append(node)\\n        while qu:\\n            curr = qu.popleft()\\n\\n            for it in curr.neighbors:\\n                if it not in ump:\\n                    ump[it] = Node(it.val, [])\\n                    qu.append(it)\\n                ump[it].neighbors.append(ump[curr])\\n        return ump[node]\\n\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {\\n        if(node == nullptr)\\n            return node;\\n        unordered_map<Node*, Node*>ump;\\n        //To find the neighbours present or not in constant time\\n\\n        queue<Node*>qu;\\n        //For bfs traversal\\n        ump[node] = new Node(node->val,{});\\n        qu.push(node);\\n        while(!qu.empty()){\\n            Node* curr = qu.front();\\n            qu.pop();\\n\\n            for(auto it:curr->neighbors){\\n                if(ump.find(it)==ump.end()){\\n                    ump[it] = new Node(it->val,{});\\n                    qu.push(it);\\n                }\\n                ump[it]->neighbors.push_back(ump[curr]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ump[node];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {\\n        if(node == null)\\n            return node;\\n        Map<Node, Node> ump = new HashMap<>();\\n        //To find the neighbours present or not in constant time\\n\\n        Queue<Node> qu = new LinkedList<>();\\n        //For bfs traversal\\n        ump.put(node, new Node(node.val, new ArrayList<>()));\\n        qu.offer(node);\\n        while(!qu.isEmpty()){\\n            Node curr = qu.poll();\\n\\n            for(Node it : curr.neighbors){\\n                if(!ump.containsKey(it)){\\n                    ump.put(it, new Node(it.val, new ArrayList<>()));\\n                    qu.offer(it);\\n                }\\n                ump.get(it).neighbors.add(ump.get(curr));\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ump.get(node);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\n```\\n# PLEASE UPVOTE\\n![upvote.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/062e4021-393a-472e-850d-41838d52280e_1680934291.9731808.jpeg)\\n\\n",

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe Clone Graph is a type of BFS & DFS problem. The purpose is to create a function that takes a node in the original graph as input and returns the corresponding node in the new graph as output. The new graph will have the same structure and values as the original, but it should be completely separate from the original.\\n\\n# DFS Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n1. We will call a `cloneDFS` method, passing in the `node` graph and a new Hashmap `visited`. The HashMap `visited` will keep track of the old nodes `cur` that have already been processed and their corresponding cloned nodes `newNode`. The key of the map is the node from the original graph, and the value of the map is the cloned node. The reason we do this is to ensure that there are no cycles in the cloned graph and that each node is cloned only once.\\n2. We need a base case to check if the current node `cur` is null. If it is, then we return null.\\n3. We need a special base case to check if the current node `cur` you are at is able to connect with another node in the hashmap. \\nEx) if current node is 2, and 1 is already in the hashmap `visited`, then you can connect 2 to 1. \\nIn the case of the starting node, this step will be skipped since the hashmap `visited` is empty. \\n4. We will create a clone node `newNode` to hold the current nodes `cur` value, then map the old node `cur` to the clone node `newNode`.\\n5. Now we loop through every neighbor of the current node `cur` and add the cloned version of each neighbor to the \"neighbors\" list of the cloned node `newNode`.\\n6. Finally, we return the cloned graph `newNode`.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(n) - where n is the number of edges + number of vertices.\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(n) - where n is the number of nodes in the graph. The Hashmap stores n entries. \\n\\n# DFS Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {\\n        //step 1\\n       return cloneDFS(node, new HashMap<>());\\n    }\\n    public Node cloneDFS(Node cur, Map<Node, Node> visited){\\n        //step 2 \\n        if(cur==null) return null;\\n        //step 3 \\n        if(visited.containsKey(cur)) return visited.get(cur);\\n        //step 4 \\n        Node newNode = new Node(cur.val);\\n        visited.put(cur, newNode);\\n        //step 5 \\n        for (Node n : cur.neighbors) {\\n            newNode.neighbors.add(cloneDFS(n, visited));\\n        }\\n        //step 6 \\n        return newNode;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n***Thank you for reading!

If not then create a newNode with the same value as the original node.

To do that, we need to traverse the entire graph while maintaining a copy of each node and its neighbors. We can use the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and create the deep copy.\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n1. First, we check if the given node exists or not. If it doesn\\'t exist, we return `None`.\\n1. We create an empty dictionary called `mapping` to keep track of the nodes and their copies. We also create a stack and add the given node to it.\\n1. We start a loop and pop a node from the stack. If the node is not already in the `mapping` dictionary, we create a new node with the same value and add it to the `mapping` dictionary. Then, we check the neighbors of the current node. If a neighbor is not already in the `mapping` dictionary, we create a new node with the same value and add it to the `mapping` dictionary. We also add the new neighbor node to the stack to process it later.\\n\\n1. After processing all the neighbors of the current node, we add them to the neighbors list of the new node in the `mapping` dictionary.\\n1. We continue the loop until the stack is empty.\\n1. Finally, we return the node with the same value as the given node from the `mapping` dictionary.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where n is the total number of nodes in the graph. We visit each node once, and for each node, we check its neighbors and add them to the stack if they haven\\'t been processed yet.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, where n is the total number of nodes in the graph. We use the `mapping` dictionary to store the copies of the nodes, and the stack to traverse the graph.

But in practice, we expect this overlap to be significant, so the space complexity is just O(N).\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n\"\"\"\\n# Definition for a Node.\\nclass Node:\\n    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):\\n        self.val = val\\n        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []\\n\"\"\"\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    def cloneGraph(self, node: \\'Node\\') -> \\'Node\\':\\n        if not node:\\n            return None\\n    \\n        visited = {}\\n        def dfs(original):\\n            if original in visited:\\n                return visited[original]\\n            copy = Node(original.val)\\n            visited[original] = copy\\n            for neighbor in original.neighbors:\\n                copy.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))\\n            return copy\\n    \\n        return dfs(node)\\n```",

Whereas OJ is explicitly checking that 1 only shows up as a neighbor in 0\\'s neighbor list.\\n\\nAlso, the expected order of processing the clone is explicitly to be done in order of label.  So if it\\'s possible to process 2 or 5, then 2 must always be processed first, rather than 5 (even in the following scenario, if one were doing BFS, and had a graph like say\\n`{0,1,5#1,2#2,5#5} `, in BFS, 5 would be processed before 2, and even though that would produce an EQUAL VALID tree description, the OJ rejects this.\\n\\nThere is absolutely zero way anyone could have determined this from the very sparse description.  Either OJ needs to be made to accept topographically similar trees, or the description needs to make it clear what the expected output is, because there is no way anyone can figure that out, unless I am mistaken. \\n\\nYes, one part of interviews are to be able to deal with ambiguity and \"ask\" more questions.  That would be a perfect place for \"hints\" to provide clarification of assumptions, but an upsetting part of LeetCode is nobody seems interested in helping find the thought process and just wants a solution.
