Here we can state the approach as -\\n* At each index `i`, we can either pick that element or not pick it.\\n* If we pick current element, then all future element must also be picked since our array needs to be contiguous.\\n* If we had picked any elements till now, we can either end further recursion at any time by returning sum formed till now or we can choose current element and recurse further. This denotes two choices of either choosing the subarray formed from 1st picked element till now or expanding the subarray by choosing current element respectively.\\n\\nIn the code below, we will use `mustPick` to denote whether we must compulsorily pick current element. When `mustPick` is true, we must either return `0` or pick current element and recurse further. If `pickCur` is false, we have both choices of not picking current element and moving on to next element, or picking the current one.\\n\\n**C++**\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {    \\n        return solve(nums, 0, false);\\n    }\\n    int solve(vector<int>& A, int i, bool mustPick) {\\n\\t\\t// our subarray must contain atleast 1 element.

Here, we use a `dp` array where `dp[mustPick][i]` denotes the maximum sum subarray starting from `i` and `mustPick` denotes wheter the current element must be picked compulsorily or not.\\n\\n**C++**\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {    \\n        vector<vector<int>> dp(2, vector<int>(size(nums), -1));\\n        return solve(nums, 0, false, dp);\\n    }\\n    int solve(vector<int>& A, int i, bool mustPick, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {\\n        if(i >= size(A)) return mustPick ? 0 : -1e5;\\n        if(dp[mustPick][i] != -1) return dp[mustPick][i];\\n        if(mustPick)\\n            return dp[mustPick][i] = max(0, A[i] + solve(A, i+1, true, dp));\\n        return dp[mustPick][i] = max(solve(A, i+1, false, dp), A[i] + solve(A, i+1, true, dp));\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Python**\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums):\\n        @cache\\n        def solve(i, must_pick):\\n            if i >= len(nums): return 0 if must_pick else -inf\\n            return max(nums[i] + solve(i+1, True), 0 if must_pick else solve(i+1, False))\\n        return solve(0, False)\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** <code>O(N)</code>, we are calculating each state of the `dp` just once and memoizing the result.

Here, we again use `dp` array and use bottom-up approach. Here `dp[1][i]` denotes maximum subarray sum ending at `i` (including `nums[i]`) and `dp[0][i]` denotes maximum subarray sum upto `i` (may or may not include `nums[i]`). \\n\\nAt each index, we update `dp[1][i]` as max between either only choosing current element - `nums[i]` or extending from previous subarray and choosing current element as well - `dp[1][i-1] + nums[i]`\\nSimilarly, `dp[0][1]` can be updated as max between maximum sum subarray found till last index - `dp[0][i-1]` or max subarray sum found ending at current index `dp[1][i]`.\\n\\n**C++**\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        vector<vector<int>> dp(2, vector<int>(size(nums)));\\n        dp[0][0] = dp[1][0] = nums[0];\\n        for(int i = 1; i < size(nums); i++) {\\n            dp[1][i] = max(nums[i], nums[i] + dp[1][i-1]);\\n            dp[0][i] = max(dp[0][i-1], dp[1][i]);\\n        }\\n        return dp[0].back();\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Python**\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums):\\n        dp = [[0]*len(nums) for i in range(2)]\\n        dp[0][0], dp[1][0] = nums[0], nums[0]\\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\\n            dp[1][i] = max(nums[i], nums[i] + dp[1][i-1])\\n            dp[0][i] = max(dp[0][i-1], dp[1][i])\\n        return dp[0][-1]\\n```\\n\\nWe can actually do away with just 1 row as well. We denoted `dp[1][i]` as the maximum subarray sum ending at `i`. We can just store that row and calculate the overall maximum subarray sum at the end by choosing the maximum of all max subarray sum ending at `i`.\\n\\n**C++**\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        vector<int> dp(nums);\\n        for(int i = 1; i < size(nums); i++) \\n            dp[i] = max(nums[i], nums[i] + dp[i-1]);        \\n        return *max_element(begin(dp), end(dp));\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Python**\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums):\\n        dp = [*nums]\\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\\n            dp[i] = max(nums[i], nums[i] + dp[i-1])\\n        return max(dp)\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** <code>O(N)</code>, we are just iterating over the `nums` array once to compute the `dp` array and once more over the `dp` at the end to find maximum subarray sum. Thus overall time complexity is `O(N) + O(N) = O(N)`\\n***Space Complexity :*** `O(N)`, for maintaining `dp`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u2714\\uFE0F ***Solution - V (Kadane\\'s Algorithm)***\\n\\nWe can observe that in the previous approach, `dp[i]` only depended on `dp[i-1]`. So do we really need to maintain the whole `dp` array of `N` elements? One might see the last line of previous solution and say that we needed all elements of `dp` at the end to find the maximum sum subarray. But we can simply optimize that by storing the max at each iteration instead of separately calculating it at the end.\\n\\nThus, we only need to maintain `curMax` which is the maximum subarray sum ending at `i` and `maxTillNow` which is the maximum sum we have seen till now. And this way of solving this problem is what we popularly know as **Kadane\\'s Algorithm**\\n\\n**C++**\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int curMax = 0, maxTillNow = INT_MIN;\\n        for(auto c : nums)\\n            curMax = max(c, curMax + c),\\n            maxTillNow = max(maxTillNow, curMax);\\n        return maxTillNow;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Python**\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums):\\n        cur_max, max_till_now = 0, -inf\\n        for c in nums:\\n            cur_max = max(c, cur_max + c)\\n            max_till_now = max(max_till_now, cur_max)\\n        return max_till_now\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** <code>O(N)</code>, for iterating over `nums` once\\n***Space Complexity :*** `O(1)`, only constant extra space is being used.\\n\\n*PS:* I have tried running `Solution - IV` and this solution multiple times and this solution, despite being `O(1)` shows higher memory usage(`28.8 MB` on average vs `28 MB` used by solution - IV) by LC consistently.

This is the follow-up question asked in this question. This involves modelling the problem by observing that the maximum subarray sum is such that it lies somewhere -\\n\\n* entirely in the left-half of array `[L, mid-1]`, OR\\n* entirely in the right-half of array `[mid+1, R]`, OR\\n* in array consisting of mid element along with some part of left-half and some part of right-half such that these form contiguous subarray - <code>[L\\', R\\'] = [L\\', mid-1] + [mid] + [mid+1,R\\']</code>, where `L\\' >= L` and `R\\' <= R`\\n\\nWith the above observation, we can recursively divide the array into sub-problems on the left and right halves and then combine these results on the way back up to find the maximum subarray sum.\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        return maxSubArray(nums, 0, size(nums)-1);\\n    }\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& A, int L, int R){\\n        if(L > R) return INT_MIN;\\n        int mid = (L + R) / 2, leftSum = 0, rightSum = 0;\\n        // leftSum = max subarray sum in [L, mid-1] and starting from mid-1\\n        for(int i = mid-1, curSum = 0; i >= L; i--)\\n            curSum += A[i],\\n            leftSum=max(leftSum, curSum);\\n        // rightSum = max subarray sum in [mid+1, R] and starting from mid+1\\n        for(int i = mid+1, curSum = 0; i <= R; i++)\\n            curSum += A[i],\\n            rightSum = max(rightSum, curSum);        \\n\\t\\t// return max of 3 cases \\n        return max({ maxSubArray(A, L, mid-1), maxSubArray(A, mid+1, R), leftSum + A[mid] + rightSum });\\n    }\\t\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Python**\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums):\\n        def maxSubArray(A, L, R):\\n            if L > R: return -inf\\n            mid, left_sum, right_sum, cur_sum = (L + R) // 2, 0, 0, 0\\n            for i in range(mid-1, L-1, -1):\\n                left_sum = max(left_sum, cur_sum := cur_sum + A[i])\\n            cur_sum = 0\\n            for i in range(mid+1, R+1):\\n                right_sum = max(right_sum, cur_sum := cur_sum + A[i])\\n            return max(maxSubArray(A, L, mid-1), maxSubArray(A, mid+1, R), left_sum + A[mid] + right_sum)\\n        return maxSubArray(nums, 0, len(nums)-1)\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** <code>O(NlogN)</code>, the recurrence relation can be written as `T(N) = 2T(N/2) + O(N)` since we are recurring for left and right half (`2T(N/2)`) and also calculating maximal subarray including mid element which takes `O(N)` to calculate. Solving this recurrence using master theorem, we can get the time complexity as `O(NlogN)`\\n***Space Complexity :*** `O(logN)`, required by recursive stack\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u2714\\uFE0F ***Solution - VII (Optimized Divide & Conquer)***\\n\\nWe can further optimize the previous solution. The `O(N)` term in the recurrence relation of previous solution was due to computation of max sum subarray involving `nums[mid]` in each recursion. \\n\\nBut we can reduce that term to `O(1)` if we precompute it. This can be done by precomputing two arrays `pre` and `suf` where `pre[i]` will denote maximum sum subarray ending at `i` and `suf[i]` denotes the maximum subarray starting at `i`. `pre` is similar to `dp` array that we computed in dynamic programming solutions and `suf` can be calculated in similar way, just by starting iteration from the end.\\n\\n**C++**\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<int> pre, suf;\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        pre = suf = nums;\\n        for(int i = 1; i < size(nums); i++)  pre[i] += max(0, pre[i-1]);\\n        for(int i = size(nums)-2; ~i; i--)   suf[i] += max(0, suf[i+1]);\\n        return maxSubArray(nums, 0, size(nums)-1);\\n    }\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& A, int L, int R){\\n        if(L == R) return A[L];\\n        int mid = (L + R) / 2;\\n        return max({ maxSubArray(A, L, mid), maxSubArray(A, mid+1, R), pre[mid] + suf[mid+1] });\\n    }\\t\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Python**\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums):\\n        pre, suf = [*nums], [*nums]\\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):       pre[i] += max(0, pre[i-1])\\n        for i in range(len(nums)-2,-1,-1):  suf[i] += max(0, suf[i+1])\\n        def maxSubArray(A, L, R):\\n            if L == R: return A[L]\\n            mid = (L + R) // 2\\n            return max(maxSubArray(A, L, mid), maxSubArray(A, mid+1, R), pre[mid] + suf[mid+1])\\n        return maxSubArray(nums, 0, len(nums)-1)\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** <code>O(N)</code>, the recurrence relation can be written as `T(N) = 2T(N/2) + O(1)` since we are recurring for left and right half (`2T(N/2)`) and calculating maximal subarray including mid element in `O(1)`. Solving this recurrence using master theorem, we can get the time complexity as `O(N)`\\n***Space Complexity :*** `O(N)`, required by `suf` and `pre`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\uD83D\\uDCA1  **Note:**\\n* The above divide and conquer solution works in `O(N)` but is **once you have calculated `pre` and `suf`, does it even make sense to go into divide and conquer approach?** I dont think divide and conquer approach after calculating `pre` & `suf`is useful, unless you Really want to solve it using **\\u275DDivde and Conquer\\u275E only**.

                "content": "**Dynamic Programming**\\n\\nThere is a nice introduction to the DP algorithm in this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem). The idea is to maintain a running maximum `smax` and a current summation `sum`. When we visit each `num` in `nums`, add `num` to `sum`, then update `smax` if necessary or reset `sum` to `0` if it becomes negative.\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int sum = 0, smax = INT_MIN;\\n        for (int num : nums) {\\n            sum += num;\\n            smax = max(smax, sum);\\n            if (sum < 0) {\\n                sum = 0;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return smax;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Divide and Conquer**\\n\\nThe Divide-and-Conquer algorithm breaks `nums` into two halves and find the maximum subarray sum in them recursively. Well, the most tricky part is to handle the case that the maximum subarray spans the two halves. For this case, we use a linear algorithm: starting from the middle element and move to both ends (left and right ends), record the maximum sum we have seen. In this case, the maximum sum is finally equal to the middle element plus the maximum sum of moving leftwards and the maximum sum of moving rightwards.\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        return maxSubArray(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1);\\n    }\\nprivate:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums, int l, int r) {\\n        if (l > r) {\\n            return INT_MIN;\\n        }\\n        int m = l + (r - l) / 2, ml = 0, mr = 0;\\n        int lmax = maxSubArray(nums, l, m - 1);\\n        int rmax = maxSubArray(nums, m + 1, r);\\n        for (int i = m - 1, sum = 0; i >= l; i--) {\\n            sum += nums[i];\\n            ml = max(sum, ml);\\n        }\\n        for (int i = m + 1, sum = 0; i <= r; i++) {\\n            sum += nums[i];\\n            mr = max(sum, mr);\\n        }\\n        return max(max(lmax, rmax), ml + mr + nums[m]);\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

It expands itself by including nums[i] (or ith index).\\n2. It discards itself and starts fresh from nums[i] (or ith index).\\n\\nAt each step, we choose **max** of above two choices for ith index and update our currMaxSum.\\nAt each step, we **update** globalMaxSum to store the global maxSum SubArray.\\n\\n##### Method1: Recursive [T(n) = O(n) and S(n) = O(n) [recursion stack space]]\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n\\tint globalMaxSum;\\n\\tint maxSubArray(vector<int> &nums, int n) {\\n\\t\\tif (n == 1) return nums[0];\\n\\t\\tint currMaxSum = max(nums[n - 1], maxSubArray(nums, n - 1) + nums[n - 1]);\\n\\t\\tglobalMaxSum = max(globalMaxSum, currMaxSum);\\n\\t\\treturn currMaxSum;\\n\\t}\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int> &nums) {\\n        globalMaxSum = nums[0];\\n\\t\\tmaxSubArray(nums, nums.size());\\n        return globalMaxSum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n##### Method2: Iterative [T(n) = O(n) and S(n) = O(1)]\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int> &nums) {\\n        int globalMaxSum = nums[0], currMaxSum = nums[0];\\n        for (int ind = 1; ind < nums.size(); ind++) {\\n            currMaxSum = max(currMaxSum + nums[ind], nums[ind]);\\n            globalMaxSum = max(globalMaxSum, currMaxSum);\\n        }\\n        return globalMaxSum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n#### Follow Up Question:\\n\\nWhat if we need to find the length OR print the maxSum SubArray? Note that there can be many such SubArrays, So, we want to print the subArray with maxLength. If more than 1 subArray exist with maxLength then we can print anyone of them.\\n\\n##### Idea:\\n\\nUse three variables: **currStart**, **globalStart** and **globalEnd** for storing starting index of **currMaxSum** SubArray, starting and ending index of **globalMaxSum** SubArray **respectively**. Note that there is no need to store ending index of **currMaxSum** SubArray as it can be maintained using current index.\\n\\nThe idea is to update currStart whenever we prefer choice 2 (detail mentioned above at starting of the post) and update globalStart and globalEnd whenver we update globalMaxSum. Doing this will give us starting and ending index of anyone of the possible subArrays with globalMaxSum.\\nNow, to find the maxLen maxSum (=globalMaxSum) SubArray, we can update globalStart and globalEnd whenever we find a potential candidate for the maxLen i.e whenver we have: `globalMaxSum = currMaxSum` such that this candidate have larger length than the current candidate i.e: `globalLen < currLen => globalEnd - globalStart + 1 < currEnd - currStart + 1 => globalEnd - globalStart < ind - currStart`\\nThis is a very useful trick that can be used/ applied in many such similar problems.\\n\\n```\\n// Use below utility function to print the subArray\\nvoid printSubArray(vector<int> &nums, int low, int high) {\\n\\tfor (int ind = low; ind <= high; ind++)\\n\\t\\tcout << nums[ind] << \" \";\\n\\tcout << \"\\\\n\";\\n}\\n```\\n\\n##### Method1: Recursive [T(n) = O(n) and S(n) = O(n) [recursion stack space]]\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n\\tint globalMaxSum, globalStart = 0, globalEnd = 0, currStart = 0;\\n\\tint maxSubArray(vector<int> &nums, int n) {\\n\\t\\tif (n == 1) return nums[0];\\n\\t\\tint currMaxSum = maxSubArray(nums, n - 1);\\n\\t\\tif (currMaxSum < 0)    // same as: currMaxSum + nums[n - 1] < nums[n - 1]\\n\\t\\t\\tcurrMaxSum = nums[n - 1], currStart = n - 1;\\n\\t\\telse currMaxSum += nums[n - 1];\\n\\t\\t// use only below if cond. to find anyone of all subArrays with globalMaxSum\\n\\t\\tif (globalMaxSum < currMaxSum)\\n\\t\\t\\tglobalMaxSum = currMaxSum, globalStart = currStart, globalEnd = n - 1;\\n\\t\\t// use below to find anyone of all maxLen subArrays with globalMaxSum\\n\\t\\telse if (globalMaxSum == currMaxSum and globalEnd - globalStart < (n - 1) - currStart)\\n\\t\\t\\tglobalStart = currStart, globalEnd = n - 1;\\n\\t\\treturn currMaxSum;\\n\\t}\\n    void printMaxSubArray(vector<int> &nums) {\\n        globalMaxSum = nums[0];\\n\\t\\tmaxSubArray(nums, nums.size());\\n\\t\\tcout << \"Following SubArray has maxSum: \" << globalMaxSum;\\n\\t\\tcout << \" and has length: \" << globalEnd - globalStart + 1 << \" :\\\\n\";\\n\\t\\tprintSubArray(nums, globalStart, globalEnd);\\n\\t\\t\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n##### Method2: Iterative [T(n) = O(n) and S(n) = O(1)]\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void maxSubArray(vector<int> &nums) {\\n        int globalMaxSum = nums[0], currMaxSum = nums[0];\\n\\t\\tint globalStart = 0, globalEnd = 0, currStart = 0;\\n        for (int ind = 1; ind < nums.size(); ind++) {\\n            if (currMaxSum < 0)    // same as: currMaxSum + nums[ind] < nums[ind]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcurrMaxSum = nums[ind], currStart = ind;\\n\\t\\t\\telse currMaxSum += nums[ind];\\n\\t\\t\\t// use only below if cond. to find anyone of all subArrays with globalMaxSum\\n\\t\\t\\tif (globalMaxSum < currMaxSum)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tglobalMaxSum = currMaxSum, globalStart = currStart, globalEnd = ind;\\n\\t\\t\\t// use below to find anyone of all maxLen subArrays with globalMaxSum\\n\\t\\t\\telse if (globalMaxSum == currMaxSum and globalEnd - globalStart < ind - currStart)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tglobalStart = currStart, globalEnd = ind;\\n        }\\n\\t\\tcout << \"Following SubArray has maxSum: \" << globalMaxSum;\\n\\t\\tcout << \" and has length: \" << globalEnd - globalStart + 1 << \" :\\\\n\";\\n\\t\\tprintSubArray(nums, globalStart, globalEnd);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n#### Important Points:\\n\\nThis solution is inspired by Kadane\\'s Algorithm (Google for more info).

                "content": "# Intuition\\nThe Intuition behind the code is to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the given array `nums`. It does this by scanning through the array and keeping track of the current sum of the subarray. Whenever the current sum becomes greater than the maximum sum encountered so far, it updates the maximum sum. If the current sum becomes negative, it resets the sum to 0 and starts a new subarray. By the end of the loop, the code returns the maximum sum found.\\n\\n# Approach:\\n\\n1. We start by initializing two variables: `maxSum` and `currentSum`.\\n   - `maxSum` represents the maximum sum encountered so far and is initially set to the minimum possible integer value to ensure that any valid subarray sum will be greater than it.\\n   - `currentSum` represents the current sum of the subarray being considered and is initially set to 0.\\n2. We iterate through the `nums` array using a for loop, starting from the first element and going up to the last element.\\n3. For each element in the array, we add it to the current sum `currentSum`. This calculates the sum of the subarray ending at the current element.\\n4. Next, we check if the current sum `currentSum` is greater than the current maximum sum `maxSum`.\\n   - If it is, we update `maxSum` with the new value of `currentSum`. This means we have found a new maximum subarray sum.\\n5. If the current sum `currentSum` becomes negative, it indicates that including the current element in the subarray would reduce the overall sum. In such cases, we reset `currentSum` to 0. This effectively discards the current subarray and allows us to start a fresh subarray from the next element.\\n6. We repeat steps 3 to 5 for each element in the array.\\n7. After iterating through the entire array, the variable `maxSum` will contain the maximum subarray sum encountered.\\n8. Finally, we return the value of `maxSum` as the result, representing the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the given array `nums`.\\n\\n# Code\\n\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int maxSum = INT_MIN;\\n        int currentSum = 0;\\n        \\n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {\\n            currentSum += nums[i];\\n            \\n            if (currentSum > maxSum) {\\n                maxSum = currentSum;\\n            }\\n            \\n            if (currentSum < 0) {\\n                currentSum = 0;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return maxSum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\\n        int currentSum = 0;\\n        \\n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\\n            currentSum += nums[i];\\n            \\n            if (currentSum > maxSum) {\\n                maxSum = currentSum;\\n            }\\n            \\n            if (currentSum < 0) {\\n                currentSum = 0;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return maxSum;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```Python3 []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        maxSum = float(\\'-inf\\')\\n        currentSum = 0\\n        \\n        for num in nums:\\n            currentSum += num\\n            \\n            if currentSum > maxSum:\\n                maxSum = currentSum\\n            \\n            if currentSum < 0:\\n                currentSum = 0\\n        \\n        return maxSum\\n```\\n\\n# clean code\\n\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int maxSum = nums[0];\\n        int currentSum = nums[0];\\n\\n        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {\\n            currentSum = max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i]);\\n            maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum);\\n        }\\n\\n        return maxSum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n        int maxSum = nums[0];\\n        int currentSum = nums[0];\\n\\n        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {\\n            currentSum = Math.max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i]);\\n            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);\\n        }\\n\\n        return maxSum;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```Python3 []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        maxSum = nums[0]\\n        currentSum = nums[0]\\n\\n        for num in nums[1:]:\\n            currentSum = max(num, currentSum + num)\\n            maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum)\\n\\n        return maxSum\\n```\\n\\n![CUTE_CAT.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/188f09ad-b402-49a2-88cc-daae4c8acbf2_1687364129.8941426.png)\\n\\n**If you are a beginner solve these problems which makes concepts clear for future coding:**\\n1.

Approach 2**: Let\\'s create another list that can store the maximum of total or nums[i].

Approach 3:** In above approach, we stored maximum total until nums[i] and then found the maximum subarray total in the end. We aren\\'t doing anything good with the new list because in the end we are traversing the list to find the maximum total.

YOU WILL DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE CODE LINE BY LINE AFTER SEEING THE APPROACH.**\\n\\n# Intuition of this Problem:\\nWe can solve this problem using **Kadane\\'s Algorithm**\\n\\n**LETS DRY RUN THIS CODE WITH ONE EXAPMPLE :**\\n\\nSuppose we have the following input vector: **[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4].**\\n\\nWe initialize the maximumSum = INT_MIN (-2147483648) and currSumSubarray = 0.\\n\\nWe loop through the input vector and perform the following operations:\\n\\nAt the first iteration, currSumSubarray becomes -2 and since it is less than 0, we set it to 0. maximumSum remains at INT_MIN.\\n\\nAt the second iteration, currSumSubarray becomes 1, which is greater than 0, so we keep it as it is. We update maximumSum to 1.\\n\\nAt the third iteration, currSumSubarray becomes -2, which is less than 0, so we set it to 0. maximumSum remains at 1.\\n\\nAt the fourth iteration, currSumSubarray becomes 4, which is greater than 0, so we keep it as it is. We update maximumSum to 4.\\n\\nAt the fifth iteration, currSumSubarray becomes 3, which is greater than 0, so we keep it as it is. maximumSum remains at 4.\\n\\nAt the sixth iteration, currSumSubarray becomes 5, which is greater than 0, so we keep it as it is. We update maximumSum to 5.\\n\\nAt the seventh iteration, currSumSubarray becomes 6, which is greater than 0, so we keep it as it is. We update maximumSum to 6.\\n\\nAt the eighth iteration, currSumSubarray becomes 1, which is greater than 0, so we keep it as it is. maximumSum remains at 6.\\n\\nAt the ninth iteration, currSumSubarray becomes 5, which is greater than 0, so we keep it as it is. maximumSum remains at 6.\\n\\nAfter iterating through the input vector, we return maximumSum which is equal to 6. Therefore, the maximum sum subarray of the given input vector is [4, -1, 2, 1], and the sum of this subarray is 6.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n\\n# Approach for this Problem:\\n1. Initialize two variables, maximumSum and currSumSubarray to the minimum integer value (INT_MIN) and 0, respectively.\\n2. Loop through the array from index 0 to n-1, where n is the size of the array.\\n3. In each iteration, add the current element of the array to the currSumSubarray variable.\\n4. Take the maximum between maximumSum and currSumSubarray and store it in the maximumSum variable.\\n5. Take the maximum between currSumSubarray and 0 and store it in currSumSubarray. This is done because if the currSumSubarray becomes negative, it means that we should start a new subarray, so we reset currSumSubarray to 0.\\n6. After the loop ends, return the maximumSum variable, which contains the maximum sum of a subarray.\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n\\n# Code:\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n        //maximumSum will calculate our ans and currSumSubarray will calculate maximum sum subarray till ith position \\n        int maximumSum = INT_MIN, currSumSubarray = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            currSumSubarray += nums[i]; \\n            maximumSum = max(maximumSum, currSumSubarray);\\n            //here we are taking max with 0 bcz if currSumSubarray = -1 or any negative value then it again starts with currSumSubarray = 0\\n            currSumSubarray = max(currSumSubarray, 0);\\n        } \\n        return maximumSum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n        int n = nums.length;\\n        int maximumSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE, currSumSubarray = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            currSumSubarray += nums[i]; \\n            maximumSum = Math.max(maximumSum, currSumSubarray);\\n            currSumSubarray = Math.max(currSumSubarray, 0);\\n        } \\n        return maximumSum;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n```Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        n = len(nums)\\n        maximumSum, currSumSubarray = float(\\'-inf\\'), 0\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            currSumSubarray += nums[i]\\n            maximumSum = max(maximumSum, currSumSubarray)\\n            currSumSubarray = max(currSumSubarray, 0)\\n        return maximumSum\\n\\n```\\n\\n# Time Complexity and Space Complexity:\\n- Time complexity: **O(n)**, where n is the size of the input array.

Totally there are at most `N^2` subarrays.

By constructing the `crossSum`, we propagate from the right-end of the left subarray `[lo, mid]` and from the left-end of the right subarray `[mid + 1, hi]`. In each direction, we are continuously updating the maximum sum.\\n\\n```java\\n// Example\\nindex: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6\\n      -5  7  3 -1  1  2  3\\n               mid\\nFor the left half, we go through from -1 to -5. The maximum sum is (-1) + 3 + 7 = 9.\\nIt can\\'t be 3 + 7 = 10, because -1 must be included (crossing).\\n```\\n\\n**BTW, Index lo/hi/mid Caveat:** (skip it. Just my person notes~)\\n\\nWrite the condition as `if (lo == hi)` (stops at one element) or `if (lo >= hi)` (stops at `0` element). Why?\\n\\nWrite the subproblem as `[lo, mid]` and `[mid + 1, hi]`, which is not like binary search (`hi = mid - 1` and `lo = mid + 1`).\\n\\n![](https://bloggg-1254259681.cos.na-siliconvalley.myqcloud.com/vtoj4.jpg)\\n\\n```java\\npublic int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n  int n = nums.length;\\n  return maxSubArray(nums, 0, n - 1);\\n}\\n\\nprivate int maxSubArray(int[] nums, int lo, int hi) {\\n  if (lo == hi) { // base case: one number\\n    return nums[lo];\\n  }\\n  // divide\\n  int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;\\n  // conquer\\n  int leftSum = maxSubArray(nums, lo, mid);\\n  int rightSum = maxSubArray(nums, mid + 1, hi);\\n  // combine\\n  int crossSum = crossSum(nums, lo, hi);\\n  return Math.max(crossSum, Math.max(leftSum, rightSum));\\n}\\n\\n// invariant: lo < hi (left part and right part both have at least 1 element\\nprivate int crossSum(int[] nums, int lo, int hi) {\\n  int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;\\n  // left\\n  int leftSum = 0, leftMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // the invariant means that leftMax and rightMax will be updated\\n  for (int i = mid; i >= lo; --i) {\\n    leftSum += nums[i];\\n    leftMax = Math.max(leftMax, leftSum);\\n  }\\n  // right\\n  int rightSum = 0, rightMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\\n  for (int i = mid + 1; i <= hi; ++i) {\\n    rightSum += nums[i];\\n    rightMax = Math.max(rightMax, rightSum);\\n  }\\n  return leftMax + rightMax;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnother version, initialize sums and max values as the first element.\\n\\n```java\\nprivate int crossSum(int[] nums, int lo, int hi, int mid) {\\n  // left\\n  int leftSum = nums[mid]; // okay because 0 <= lo <= mid < hi <= n - 1\\n  int leftMax = leftSum;\\n  for (int i = mid - 1; i >= lo; --i) {\\n    leftSum += nums[i];\\n    leftMax = Math.max(leftMax, leftSum);\\n  }\\n  // right\\n  int rightSum = nums[mid + 1]; // lo < hi is guaranteed\\n  int rightMax = rightSum;\\n  for (int i = mid + 2; i <= hi; ++i) {\\n    rightSum += nums[i];\\n    rightMax = Math.max(rightMax, rightSum);\\n  }\\n  return leftMax + rightMax;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Time:** `O(N\\\\log{N})` since `T(N) = 2T(N/2) + O(N)`.\\n**Space:** `O(\\\\log{N})`\\n\\n\\n\\n### DP\\n\\nSuppose we know the maximum subarray ending at `i` (inclusive). We denote `SUM(i)` as the maximum sum of a subarray ending at index `i` and denote `OPT(i)` as the maximum sum in the subarray `[0, i]`. Our final result is `OPT(n - 1)`. (notice the difference since it is very trivial)\\n\\nFor an element `nums[i]`, we have two choices: Appending it to a previous subarray `SUM(i - 1)` or start a new subarray from itself. Then we can write the recurrence for `SUM(i)` and `OPT(i)` as follows:\\n\\n`SUM(i)` = max(`SUM(i - 1) + nums[i]`, `nums[i]`)\\n`OPT(i)` = max(`OPT(i - 1)`, `SUM(i)`).\\n\\nNote: `OPT` is updated when a larger `SUM[i]` is discovered.\\n\\nThe initial values are `SUM(0) = nums[0]` and `OPT(0) = nums[0]`. We can do it in one pass. So here is the code:\\n\\n```java\\npublic int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n  int n = nums.length;\\n  int[] SUM = new int[n];\\n  int[] OPT = new int[n];\\n  SUM[0] = nums[0]; // init\\n  OPT[0] = nums[0];\\n  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\\n    SUM[i] = Math.max(SUM[i - 1] + nums[i], nums[i]);\\n    OPT[i] = Math.max(OPT[i - 1], SUM[i]);\\n  }\\n  return OPT[n - 1];\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSince `SUM(i)` and `OPT(i)` could be calculated by the previous values, we don\\'t need arrays of size `n` to store all information. Here is the code that reduces the space complexity:\\n\\n```java\\npublic int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n  int n = nums.length;\\n  int SUM = nums[0];\\n  int OPT = nums[0];\\n  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\\n    SUM = Math.max(SUM + nums[i], nums[i]);\\n    OPT = Math.max(OPT, SUM);\\n  }\\n  return OPT;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Time:** `O(N)`\\n**Space:** `O(1)`\\n\\n\\n\\n",

                "content": "So I was implementing a dynamic appraoch, and I though it would be good practice to implement a the different solutions that I could think of and analyze the Big O of each of them.\\n\\n### O(n\\xB2) Time - O(1) Space - Naive approach\\n##### 320ms on my connection\\n```Javascript\\nvar maxSubArray = function(nums) {\\n  let max = nums[0];\\n\\n  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 1) {\\n    let currentMax = nums[i];\\n    for (let j = i + 1; j <nums.length; j += 1) {\\n      currentMax = Math.max(currentMax + nums[j], nums[j]);\\n      max = Math.max(currentMax, max);\\n    }\\n  }\\n  \\n  return max;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nWhat is going on here is that we check from the start of number at i, and then add each sequential number at j. Each iteration will check to see what the ```currentMax``` is, either ```nums[j]``` or ```nums[j] + currentMax```, and them compare the ```max``` to the ```currentMax```. This will run for every number and thus we have a time quadratic time complexity with a constant space complexity. This is passing, however, there should be more tests that should get filter out this solution. O(n\\xB2) should be avoided if there is a better solution.\\n\\n### O(n) Time - O(n) Space - Dynamic Hashing\\n##### 88ms on my connection\\n```Javascript\\nvar maxSubArray = function(nums) {\\n  const hash = { 0: nums[0]}\\n  let max = nums[0];\\n\\n  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i += 1) {\\n    hash[i] = Math.max(hash[i - 1] + nums[i], nums[i]);\\n    max = Math.max(hash[i], max);\\n  }\\n  \\n  return max;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nFor this solution we are utilizing a hash to keep track of the max for the previous number. What we calculate the maximum based on the previous maximum and the current value. The **KEY** point here is that we are looking for the largest **SEQUENTIAL** max.\\n\\nExample, take this array of four numbers:\\n```Javascript\\nconst nums = [1, -10, 5, 6];\\n```\\nThe maximum value that you can get from a subarray from index 0 to 0 (```nums[0]```) is the value itself. When we look at the next value, the maximum value you can get would either be the previous value plus the current value or the current value itself. So what we do is create a hash to keep track of the maxes at each index:\\n```Javascript\\n// Key : Value => index : max at that index\\nconst hash = {\\n  0: 1 // nums[0] since there was no previous max\\n  1: -9 // hash[0] + nums[1] > nums[1] => 1 + -10 > -10\\n  2: 5 // hash[1] + nums[2] < nums[2] => -9 + 5 < 5\\n  3: 11 // hash[2] + nums[3] > nums[3] => 5 + 6 > 6\\n}\\n```\\nThis may seem strange since we are not technically checking at every single possibility, but the pattern allows us to come to this solution. Whe have a O(n) time solution with a O(n) space complexity. However, it is far faster than the previous solution. We can, however, improve this even more to utilize constant space.\\n\\n### O(n) Time - O(1) Space - No Hashing!\\n##### 60ms on my connection\\n```Javascript\\nvar maxSubArray = function(nums) {\\n  let currentMax = nums[0];\\n  let max = nums[0];\\n\\n  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i += 1) {\\n    currentMax = Math.max(currentMax + nums[i], nums[i]);\\n    max = Math.max(currentMax, max);\\n  }\\n  \\n  return max;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIf you\\'ve noticed, we only needed to worry about the previous max value at each index of the array, so we don\\'t need to keep track of every max at each instance for this function. By just storing the previous maximum for each element, we can check the ```currentMax``` like we have been in the previous examples and set the ```max``` accordingly. This solution retain the O(n) time complexity, but removes the necessity for keeping track of every element we come across.",

Sure, there are many other ways to solve this problem, but I find DP to be a lot more straight forward to come up with answers and optimize from there.\\n\\n**Step 1**. Figure out recurrence relation\\nWith each index denoted by ``i``, you have two options to determine the maximum sum:\\na) stop counting the running sum and start over with current index\\nb) keep on counting the running sum\\nThose two options ^ are determined based on the current running sum. Thus, we can denote the recurrence relation as:\\n``maxSum(i) = Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] + maxSum(nums, i + 1))``\\nUsing the formula above, we can now move on to next step.\\n\\n**Step 2**. Top-down approach (Recursive)\\nNow that we found out the recurrence relations, we just need to find out the base case (a place to stop recursing). This case, it would return 0 when the index gets out of index.\\n```java\\nint max;\\npublic int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n\\tif (nums.length == 0) {\\n\\t\\treturn 0;\\n\\t}\\n\\tmax = nums[0];\\n\\tmaxSum(nums, 0);\\n\\treturn max;\\n}\\npublic int maxSum(int[] nums, int i) {\\n\\tif (i == nums.length) {\\n\\t\\treturn 0;\\n\\t}\\n\\tint res = Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] + maxSum(nums, i + 1));\\n\\tmax = Math.max(max, res);\\n\\treturn res;\\n}\\n```\\nWhile this would work for most cases, it could be done better.\\n\\n**Step 3**. Top-down approach with memoization (Still recursive)\\nThis step should be pretty trivial. Now we add some memory so that we do not try to compute subproblems that has already been solved.\\n```java\\nint max;\\nInteger[] memo;\\n\\npublic int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n\\tif (nums.length == 0) {\\n\\t\\treturn 0;\\n\\t}\\n\\tmax = nums[0];\\n\\tmemo = new Integer[nums.length];\\n\\tmaxSum(nums, 0);\\n\\treturn max;\\n}\\n\\npublic int maxSum(int[] nums, int i) {\\n\\tif (i == nums.length) {\\n\\t\\treturn 0;\\n\\t}\\n\\tif (memo[i] != null) {\\n\\t\\treturn memo[i];\\n\\t}\\n\\tint res = Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] + maxSum(nums, i + 1));\\n\\tmax = Math.max(max, res);\\n\\tmemo[i] = res;\\n\\treturn res;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Step 4**. Bottom-up approach (Iteration)\\nLooking at pattern above, now we can try to convert it into iteration. Time and space complexity should still be the same as step 3, but now we do not have to rely on recursion stack to solve the problem. (Also gets rid of pesky global variables)\\n```java\\npublic int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n\\tif (nums.length == 0) {\\n\\t\\treturn 0;\\n\\t}\\n\\tint[] dp = new int[nums.length];\\n\\tdp[0] = nums[0];\\n\\tint max = nums[0];\\n\\tfor (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {\\n\\t\\tdp[i] = Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] + dp[i - 1]);\\n\\t\\tmax = Math.max(max, dp[i]);\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn max;\\n}\\n```\\n**Step 5**. Bottom-up approach with space optimized (Iteration)\\nWhile converting it into bottom up, we notice that we are only concerned with the previous maximum element. Thus, we can simply replace an array with one variable to make the space constant!\\n```java\\npublic int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n\\tif (nums.length == 0) {\\n\\t\\treturn 0;\\n\\t}\\n\\tint prev = nums[0];\\n\\tint max = nums[0];\\n\\tfor (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {\\n\\t\\tint localMax = Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] + prev);\\n\\t\\tmax = Math.max(max, localMax);\\n\\t\\tprev = localMax;\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn max;\\n}\\n```\\n",

If it is, it\\'s better to discard whatever we have so far, and start fresh from 0.

This allows you to both assign a value AND use the value immediately. \\nFor example:\\n`(i=1)==1` -> always true because `1 == 1`\\n`(sum = sum + nums[i]) > nums[i]` is true only if `sum` was non-negative beforehand. \\nThe += operation is shorthand for something like the line directly above where something is added to a variable and then stored back in that same variable.",

The recursive relation solves max subarray starting at i but the max subarray can be computed along the way. f(i)=max(nums[i], nums[i] + f(i+1))\\n* java\\n```\\n\\tpublic int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n        int max=Integer.MIN_VALUE, pre=0;\\n        for(int num:nums) {\\n            pre = pre>0?pre+num:num;\\n            max = Math.max(max, pre);\\n        }\\n        return max;\\n    }\\n```\\n* c++\\n```\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int pre =0, ma=INT_MIN;\\n        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++) {\\n            pre = pre>0? pre+nums[i]:nums[i];\\n            ma= max(ma,pre);\\n        }\\n        return ma;\\n    }\\n```\\n5. O(n) divide and conquer, the max subarray starting and ending at the boundary can be computed at the leaves and passed up.

However, that will give us O(n^2) which is not what we are looking for in this case. We want to do this in one pass which leads us to the current solution. The goal is to iterate the list and, for every element, we want to see if it is more advantageous to keep the current contiguous line going, or if it is better to start a new contiguous line at the current element. Finally, by keeping track of the largest sum thus far, we will reach our final answer.\\n**Code Breakdown**\\n\\tWe can initialize both the currSum and maxSum to the first element because that will be the first contiguous line. Then, as we are iterating, we will update the currSum to be the maximum between currVal and currVal + currSum. This tells us if it is more adventagous to start a new line at the current element or continue with the previous line. As an example, with [4,-5,10] as nums and 10 as currVal, we want to start a new line starting at 10 rather than continuing the previous subarray [4,-5]. This is because the subarray [4,-5,10] is smaller than the subarray [10].\\n\\tFinally, we can track the maxSum which is the max of the currSum and maxSum so far.\\n**Big O Breakdown**\\nThis is O(n) because we are only looking at each element in the list one time, and every calculation in the list is O(1).\\n\\nLeave a like if it helped!

                "content": "\\nIn computer science, maximum subarray problem is the task to find a contiguous subarray with the largest sum. This problem was proposed by Uif Grenander in 1977. In 1984, Jay Kadane designed an O(n) algorithm to solve the problem. We call the algorithm \"Kadane\\'s algorithm\".\\n\\n## Brute-force approach\\nWe can use brute-force to calculate sum of all possible subarray, and then get the maximum sum. Time complexity of brute-force solution will be O(n^3).\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public int MaxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n        \\n        if(nums == null || nums.Length == 0)\\n            return 0;\\n        \\n        int maxSum = nums[0];\\n        \\n        for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)\\n        {\\n            for(int j = i; j < nums.Length; j++)\\n            {\\n                int currSum = 0;\\n                \\n                for(int k = i; k <= j; k++)\\n                {\\n                    currSum += nums[k];\\n                }\\n                \\n                maxSum = Math.Max(maxSum, currSum);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return maxSum;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe brute-force solution can be improved to O(n^2) time complexity by using a variable to store the running sum at all possible positions.\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public int MaxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n        \\n        if(nums == null || nums.Length == 0)\\n            return 0;\\n        \\n        int maxSum = nums[0];\\n        \\n        for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++)\\n        {\\n            int currSum = 0;\\n                \\n            for(int j = i; j < nums.Length; j++)\\n            {\\n                currSum += nums[j];\\n                maxSum = Math.Max(maxSum, currSum);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return maxSum;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Dynamic Programming approach\\nInstead of using each index as the starting position of subarray in the brute-force approach, DP approach uses each index as the ending point, so that when calculating sum of the next subarray, the algorithm can take advantage of the previous calculations. The formula is: sum[i] = sum[i-1] + nums[i]. This DP approach will improve the time complexity to O(n) and has O(n) space complexity.\\n\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public int MaxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n        \\n        if(nums == null || nums.Length == 0)\\n            return 0;\\n        \\n        int[] dp = new int[nums.Length];\\n        dp[0] = nums[0];\\n        \\n        for(int i = 1; i < nums.Length; i++)\\n        {\\n            dp[i] = Math.Max(dp[i - 1] + nums[i], nums[i]);\\n        }\\n        \\n        return dp.Max();        \\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Kadane\\'s algorithm\\nKadane\\'s algorithm is implemented on top of the DP approach. It uses a local variable to track maximum sum of all subarray.

To solve this, we can use a technique called Kadane\\'s algorithm.\\n\\n# Approach:\\n1. Initialize two variables, \"max\" and \"meh,\" to keep track of the maximum sum found so far and the sum of the current subarray, respectively. Set \"max\" to the smallest possible integer value (INT_MIN) and \"meh\" to 0.\\n2. Iterate through the input array \"nums\" from left to right.\\n3. Add the current element to \"meh\" to extend the current subarray.\\n4. If \"meh\" is greater than \"max,\" update \"max\" with the value of \"meh\" since we have found a new maximum subarray sum.\\n5. If \"meh\" becomes negative (indicating that the current subarray has a negative sum), reset \"meh\" to 0, as any negative sum would only decrease the sum of any future subarrays.\\n6. After iterating through the entire array, return the value of \"max,\" which represents the maximum subarray sum.\\n\\n# Complexity:\\n- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input array \"nums.\" We iterate through the array once.\\n- The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of additional space to store the variables \"max\" and \"meh.\"\\n\\n---\\n# C++\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        // meh \\u2013 max sum ending at ith index\\n        int max = INT_MIN, meh = 0;\\n        for (int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++) {\\n            meh = meh + nums[i];\\n            if (meh > max) {\\n                max = meh;\\n            }\\n            if (meh < 0) {\\n                meh = 0;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return max;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n# Java\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\\n        int meh = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\\n            meh = meh + nums[i];\\n            if (meh > max) {\\n                max = meh;\\n            }\\n            if (meh < 0) {\\n                meh = 0;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return max;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n# Python\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums):\\n        max_sum = float(\\'-inf\\')\\n        meh = 0\\n        for num in nums:\\n            meh = meh + num\\n            if meh > max_sum:\\n                max_sum = meh\\n            if meh < 0:\\n                meh = 0\\n        return max_sum\\n```\\n\\n---\\n# JavaScript\\n```\\nvar maxSubArray = function(nums) {\\n    let max = -Infinity;\\n    let meh = 0;\\n    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\\n        meh += nums[i];\\n        if (meh > max) {\\n            max = meh;\\n        }\\n        if (meh < 0) {\\n            meh = 0;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return max;\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "[This is a classic problem of theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem)\\n\\nBecause the *maximum subarray problem* is essentially  an **optimization problem** we can thus break it up into smaller problems\\nand return the best result of the said smaller problems..\\nSince we are breaking it up into smaller subarrays anyway we can **eliminate/ignore** subarrays that are *guaranteed* to not provide the optimal solution.\\nThe question we have to contend with now is *What criterea for elimination allows us to reduce the problem space efficiently?*\\n**[010]** Well it becomes a lot easier to establish this critereon if we have a starting point to compare subsequent subarrays to, since our function will not know much about the input array without analyzing it first lets just use the subarray of just the first index to start with and take its value as both our initial maximum value and our initial current value.\\n**[020]** Now that we have both a current subarray and a \\'maximum\\' to compare to lets consider some conditions\\n**[030]** If the sum of the current subarray is negative we can just toss that whole subarray out and start over with the new subbaray being the next index. because that whole subarray is a net drain on the optimal solution we are trying to build\\n**[035]** if the sum of the current subarray is non-negative add the next index to it, even if we lose some value with this addition we\\'re only keeping track of the highest valued subarray & the current subarray. As long as this subarray we\\'re currently keeping track of is a net positive it might be included in the maximum\\n**[040]** If this new current\\'s sum is greater than the \\'maximum\\'s make it the new maximum\\n**[050]** repeat from [020] until we have visited all items in nums\\n\\nNow that we have an algorithm lets see it in action with the example of one of the testcases:\\n```[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]```\\nInitially we\\'ll start with the leftmost value **-2**:\\n```\\nmax = -2, current sum = -2\\nmaximum subarray:\\n[-2]\\ncurrent subarray:\\n[-2]\\nremainder:\\n[1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]\\n```\\nsince **-2** is negative it\\'ll be a net drain on the optimal solution so we\\'ll just ignore it going forward and start a new\\nsubarray on the next value **1** which happens to be greater than -2\\n```\\nmax = 1, current sum= 1\\nmaximum subarray:\\n[1]\\ncurrent subarray:\\n[1]\\nremainder:\\n[-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]\\n```\\nadding the next value of **-3** brings us down a value of **-2**\\nmeaning the subarray is a net negative now and we\\'ll just discard it going forward\\n```\\nmax = 1, current sum=  -2\\nmaximum subarray:\\n[1]\\ncurrent subarray:\\n[1, -3]\\nremainder:\\n[4,-1,2,1,-5,4]\\n```\\nThe next value of **4** is greater than our previous maximum so we\\'ll just continue on from there\\n```\\nmax = 4, current sum=  4\\nmaximum subarray:\\n[4]\\ncurrent subarray:\\n[4]\\nremainder:\\n[-1,2,1,-5,4]\\n```\\nAdding the next value of **-1** doesnt produce a new maximum so we wont replace the old mximum but since it doesnt make the current a net negative we\\'ll keep working with it\\n```\\nmax = 4, current sum=  3\\nmaximum subarray:\\n[4]\\ncurrent subarray:\\n[4, -1]\\nremainder:\\n[2,1,-5,4]\\n```\\nAha! Adding this next value of **2** produces a new maximum of **5**\\n```\\nmax = 5, current sum=  5\\nmaximum subarray:\\n[4, -1, 2]\\ncurrent subarray:\\n[4, -1, 2]\\nremainder:\\n[1,-5,4]\\n```\\nIterating again brings us to a max of **6**\\n```\\nmax = 6, current sum= 6\\nmaximum subarray:\\n[4, -1, 2, 1]\\ncurrent subarray:\\n[4, -1, 2, 1]\\nremainder:\\n[-5,4]\\n```\\nPerforming the remaining iterations doesnt produce a new max \\n```\\nmax = 6, current sum= 1\\nmaximum subarray:\\n[4, -1, 2, 1]\\ncurrent subarray:\\n[4, -1, 2, 1,-5]\\nremainder:\\n[4]\\n```\\n```\\nmax = 6, current sum= 5\\nmaximum subarray:\\n[4, -1, 2, 1]\\ncurrent subarray:\\n[4, -1, 2, 1,-5,4]\\nremainder:\\n[]\\n```\\nThis will leave us with a maximum subarray sum of 6 so we return that.\\n\\nNow that we have an algorithm that works lets implement it in python:\\n```\\ndef maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        maxsum = cursum = nums[0]\\n    \\n        for n in range(1,len(nums)):\\n            if cursum < 0: cursum = 0\\n            cursum += nums[n]\\n            if cursum > maxsum: maxsum = cursum\\n        \\n        return maxsum\\n```\\nThis solution provides a time complexity of ```T(n)=O(n)``` and a space complexity of ```S(n) = O(1)```  (ignoring the memory allocation of passing ```nums``` to the function by value.)\\nThis particular implentation gives a best runtime of 648ms  (99.83th percentile) and a best memory use of 27.7mb (97.42th percentile) \\nTheres many different ways to implement kadane\\'s algorithm (leftwise comparison to maximum) in python but as long as it mostly matches the optimal implementation (only keeping track of the current and max sum, iterating over nums instead of generating a new list to iterate over, etc.)  the particulars of any given implementation will be optimized out when compiled to bytecode. You should be more concerned with writing code for clarity and being idiomatic in the language of your choice instead of making micro-optimizations.",

Or the middle element is there in the Sum. so with left subarray and right subarray, problem can be broken down to a recursive call. The crossing subarray , the one with the middle element needs to be solved as a base case, and it is easy to solve as we already know from where to start, you just start from the middle and traverse towards left, till you get an increase in total sum, so keep track of two sums , similarly do this for right side, and return the sum. \\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    int getCrossSum(vector<int> &nums,int low,int high)\\n    {\\n        if(low >=high)\\n            return nums[low];\\n        int mid = low+high;\\n        mid =mid/2;\\n        int sum = nums[mid];\\n        int tsum=sum;\\n        for(int i = mid-1;i>=low;i--)\\n        {\\n            tsum+=nums[i];\\n            if(sum<tsum)\\n                sum=tsum;\\n        }\\n        tsum=sum;\\n        for(int i = mid+1; i<=high; i++)\\n        {\\n            tsum+=nums[i];\\n            if(sum<tsum)\\n                sum=tsum;\\n        }\\n        return sum;\\n    }\\n    int maxSum(vector<int> &nums,int low, int high) {\\n        if(low>=high)\\n            return nums[low];\\n        int mid = low+high;\\n        mid = mid/2;\\n        int crossSum = getCrossSum(nums,low,high);\\n        int leftSum = maxSum(nums,low,mid);\\n        int rightSum = maxSum(nums,mid+1,high);\\n        if(leftSum> rightSum && leftSum> crossSum)\\n            return leftSum; \\n        if(rightSum> crossSum)\\n            return rightSum;\\n        return crossSum;\\n    }\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        return maxSum(nums,0,nums.size()-1);\\n    }\\n    /*int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        if(nums.empty())\\n            return 0; \\n        int cur = 0,res=nums[0]; \\n        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++)\\n        {\\n            cur = max(nums[i],cur+=nums[i]);\\n            res = max(cur,res);\\n        }\\n        return res;\\n    }*/\\n};",

If sum exceeds max then store sum in max. If sum is negative then set sum to 0 because we do not need negative sum and the sum needs to be continous as subarray is specified in the question so for starting the sum for a new subarray we need to set the sum to 0.\\n\\n# **Complexity**\\n\\n- Time complexity:\\n\\n```\\nO(n)\\n```\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n\\n```\\nO(1)\\n```\\n\\n# **Code**\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int sum=0,max=nums[0];\\n     for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++)\\n     {\\n         sum+=nums[i];\\n         if(sum>max)\\n            max=sum;\\n        if(sum<0)\\n            sum=0;\\n     }   \\n     return max;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

On each subsequent iteration of j, it is simply readding everything it did in the previous iteration except it just adds the next nums value. An example is [2,-1,3]. It first sums the subarray [2], then [2,-1], [2,-1,3]... We can simply store the previous results in an array (memoization) and add the new nums value with the previous cumulative sum. This removes the third loop.\\n\\ntime: O(n^2), space: O(n)\\nWe can still do better :|\\n```\\npublic int solution2(int[] nums) {\\n\\tint max = 0;\\n\\tfor (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\\n\\t\\tint memo[] = new int[nums.length + 1 - i];\\n\\t\\tmemo[0] = nums[i];\\n\\t\\tmax = Math.max(max, memo[0]);\\n\\t\\tfor (int j = 1; j < memo.length - 1; j++) {\\n\\t\\t\\tmemo[j] = memo[j - 1] + nums[i + j];\\n\\t\\t\\tmax = Math.max(max, memo[j]);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn max;\\n}\\n```\\n</br>\\n\\nWe can make memo smaller cause we don\\'t need all the previous results, just the most recent previous. A very typical memoization optimization technique.\\n\\ntime: O(n^2), space: O(1)\\nConstant space :)\\n```java\\npublic int solution3(int[] nums) {\\n\\tint max = 0;\\n\\tfor (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\\n\\t\\tint memo = nums[i];\\n\\t\\tmax = Math.max(max, nums[i]);\\n\\t\\tfor (int j = 1; j < nums.length - i; j++) {\\n\\t\\t\\tmemo = memo + nums[i + j]; // currVal = prevVal + currNum\\n\\t\\t\\tmax = Math.max(max, memo);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn max;\\n}\\n```\\n</br>\\n\\nThis one is difficult. Notice that the results won\\'t change for the above if we change memo update to the following: `memo = Math.max(nums[i + j], memo + nums[i + j]);` We then realize the second loop is unnecesary. We notice that we don\\'t actually need to compare every cumulative sum all the way from i + j. We just need to know the current valid one at i. Let me explain. \\nOur memo is currently storing the cumulative sum. Our objective is to find the max cumulative sum possible in our array. On every step in this array, we know the maximum sum at the moment can either be the current cumulative sum (what was added up so far) or it could start from the current value. The current cumulative sum can fall below the current nums value (cause negative values are possible), in which we have to reassign our cumulative sum variable as the current nums value (cause it can never grow bigger if it\\'s subtracting from our cumulative sum at that point). We then can compare every valid cumulative sum with each other by keeping track of the global maximum like we\\'ve been doing in the previous solutions.\\n\\nA different way to visualize it can be a sliding-window. Imagine that we\\'re changing the starting index of our subarray, once we find that the sum of the current subarray is smaller than the nums value at our current index. So we update the start index to be the current index. But we don\\'t actually needed to keep track of the indices of our \"subarray window\" cause we can just keep track of the cumulative sum. If you approach this problem through the sliding-window way, you should still arrive at the same optimized answer I have given below once you realize you don\\'t need to keep track of the indices.\\n\\nAn explanation for more proofy people, the invariant holds true that we can\\'t increase the cumulative sum anymore on every iteration when we know that the current cumulative sum (includes the curr value) falls below our curr value. The current cumulative sum will never be bigger than if we just start the cumulative sum from the curr index. We can then just keep track of a global maximum value, to find which valid cumulative sums are possible.\\n\\nI basically said the same thing 3 times... You get the point.\\n\\ntime: O(n), space: O(1)\\n100%! :))\\n```java\\npublic int solution4(int[] nums) {\\n\\tif (nums.length == 0) {\\n\\t\\treturn 0;\\n\\t}\\n\\tint currSum = nums[0];\\n\\tint max = nums[0];\\n\\tfor (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {\\n\\t\\tcurrSum += nums[i];\\n\\t\\tcurrSum = Math.max(nums[i], currSum); // curr value vs curr cumulativee\\n\\t\\tmax = Math.max(max, currSum);\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn max;\\n}\\n```",

Also, by accumulating the numbers in the sub array we might run into negative numbers that will decrease the total value of the sum, which is why we need to always compare the local sum to the global sum.\\n\\nAfter going through the entire array with double for loops, you should be able to return the global max sum sub array.\\n\\nTime Complexity: O(n^2)\\nSpace Complexity: O(1)\\n\\n**Solution #2 Kadane\\'s Algorithm:**\\n\\nKadane\\'s algorithm is a combination of the greedy algorithm and dynamic programming. \\n\\nGreedy algorithm:\\nWe keep track of the locally optimal solution while simultaneously comparing it to our global solution.\\n\\nDynamic programming:\\nOnce we solved the sub problem, in this case, the maximum sum of the sub array then we can use memoization to keep track of the solution. By keeping track of our previous solution (local solution), it allows us to solve the problem once and we can build the next solution.

                "content": "# Explaination:\\nThis problem is basically asking us, if we were to check every sum of every single subarray in the input array we were given, what would be the max sum?\\n**Example Input:** [1,2,-2]\\n**Subarrays:**\\n[1] -> Sum = 1\\n[1,2] -> Sum = 3\\n[1,2,-2] -> Sum = 1\\n[2] -> Sum = 2\\n[2,-2] -> Sum = 0\\n[-2] -> Sum = -2\\nThe Max Sum would be 3 from the subarray [1,2]\\n\\nA subarray basically means there are no breaks in-between. \\nSo for the example, that input [1,2,-2]\\nA valid subarray is [1,2] or [1,2,-2]. \\nBut [1,-2] would NOT be a subarray because it skipped 2.\\n\\n**Solution Explaination:**\\nTo solve this problem we break it down into sub problems. Basically we will use Kadane\\'s Algorithm. All we will be doing is, on every iteration we ask ourselves, **\"Do we want to extend the subarray we have seen so far? Or do we want to start a new subarray?\"**\\n\\nTo answer these questions, we look at the sum of the previous subarray and add it to the current number we are on, this will be the sum if we extend the subarray we have seen so far.\\nThen we just compare the sum of the extension to the number we are at currently, if the number we are at currently is bigger than the sum after extending the previous subarray, we start a new subarray. \\n**Lets see an example:** [1,2,-2]\\nLets say we visited 1 already, so our currentSum is 1.\\nNow we are at 2, we ask ourselves, \"should I extend my previous subarray `[1]` with the sum of 1, or should I start a new subarray at `[2]`?\\nIf we extend, the new subarray will be `[1,2]` with a sum of 3\\nIf we don\\'t extend and start a new subarray, the new subarray will be `[2]` with a sum of 2.\\n3 is greater than 2, so we choose to extend our previous subarray.\\n\\nBut now we are at -2.\\nDo we extend our previous subarray or start a new?\\nWell, our previous subarray `[1,2]` has a sum 3, and if we add -2, it becomes 1\\nSo if we start a new subarray it will be `[-2]` with a sum of -2.\\n1 is greater than -2 so we extend our previous subarray.\\n\\nWhat if our input was instead, [1,2,-4, 1]?\\nLets say we reach -3, our previous subarray would be 3 so if we extend we do 3 + -4 which would be -1 and -1 is greater than -4 so we just extend the subarray.\\nBut notice, now we reach 1, the last input in the array.\\n\\nIf we extend we will do -1 + 1 which will be 0.\\nIf we start a new subarray, it will be 1.\\n1 is greater than 0, so we start a new subarray. This is the case we must handle and watch out for because this can change our entire answer.\\n\\n**Solution Breakdown:**\\n1. We create a variable `maxSum` to keep track of the max sum we have seen from all the subarrays.\\n2. We create a variable `curSum` to keep track of the current subarray sum\\n3. Now we just use a `for` loop to iterate through every number in `nums`\\n4. Now we ask ourselves the question on every iteration. **\"Do we want to extend from our previous subarray sum? Or do we want to start a new subarray?**\\n5. `curSum + num` represents the sum we will get if we extend from our previous subarray and `num` just represents the new sum we will have if we start a new subarray. If the sum after extending the previous subarray is smaller than the sum of the current number we are on, we just start a new subarray and save the current number to `curSum`\\n6. If the sum after extending the previous subarray is bigger or equal, then we just add the current number to our previous subarray sum `curSum` to continue extending.\\n7. On every iteration we check if our `curSum` for the subarray we are on is bigger than our previous `maxSum` and if it is, we save it in `maxSum`\\n8. Finally we just return `maxSum`\\n\\n**Time O(N) | Space O(1)**\\nTime is O(N) because we just iterate through the entire array once.\\nSpace is O(1) because we are using scaling memory/space which scales with the input. We only have variables that we are modifiyng. \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        maxSum = nums[0] # Keep track of max sub-array sum\\n        curSum = 0 # Keep track of current sub-array sum\\n        \\n        for num in nums:\\n            if curSum + num < num:\\n                curSum = num # Start a new sub-array\\n            else:\\n                curSum = curSum + num # Extend from our previous sub-array\\n            maxSum = max(maxSum, curSum)\\n        return maxSum\\n            \\n```",

With the before-mentioned \"medium\" problems, basically understanding the problem definition and drawing it out and knowing recursion/core CS data structures -- you can pull off an algorithm pretty directly.

With the before-mentioned \"medium\" problems, basically understanding the problem definition and drawing it out and knowing recursion/core CS data structures -- you can pull off an algorithm pretty directly.

With the before-mentioned \"medium\" problems, basically understanding the problem definition and drawing it out and knowing recursion/core CS data structures -- you can pull off an algorithm pretty directly.

With the before-mentioned \"medium\" problems, basically understanding the problem definition and drawing it out and knowing recursion/core CS data structures -- you can pull off an algorithm pretty directly.

With the before-mentioned \"medium\" problems, basically understanding the problem definition and drawing it out and knowing recursion/core CS data structures -- you can pull off an algorithm pretty directly.

With the before-mentioned \"medium\" problems, basically understanding the problem definition and drawing it out and knowing recursion/core CS data structures -- you can pull off an algorithm pretty directly.

Each chunk could be a list of numbers that are processed all at once by the `max_subarray_stream` function. \\n\\nIn a real-world scenario, the chunk size would depend on factors like the rate at which data is received from the stream and the memory constraints of the machine running this code. It\\'s worth noting that the chunk size does not affect the final result, because Kadane\\'s algorithm does not depend on future data."

The local maximum at each position is the maximum of the current number and the sum of the current number and the previous local maximum. This basically means we have two choices at each step: to add the current number to the subarray or start a new subarray with the current number. We choose the option that gives the maximum sum.\\n\\n2.

DP can be a tough concept to master, and it often isn\\'t immediately obvious how to apply it to a new problem. \\n\\nThe fundamental concept behind Kadane\\'s algorithm is the idea of \"local maximum\" and \"global maximum\". \\n\\n1. The local maximum at each position is the maximum of the current number and the sum of the current number and the previous local maximum. This basically means we have two choices at each step: to add the current number to the subarray or start a new subarray with the current number. We choose the option that gives the maximum sum.\\n\\n2. The global maximum is the maximum sum of all subarrays that we\\'ve seen so far.\\n\\nEven if you didn\\'t come up with this solution yourself, now that you\\'ve seen it and understand it, you\\'re likely to recognize similar problems in the future where a similar approach can be used.

Each chunk could be a list of numbers that are processed all at once by the `max_subarray_stream` function. \\n\\nIn a real-world scenario, the chunk size would depend on factors like the rate at which data is received from the stream and the memory constraints of the machine running this code. It\\'s worth noting that the chunk size does not affect the final result, because Kadane\\'s algorithm does not depend on future data."

However, there seems to be an issue with how the array is split in the recursive calls.\\n\\nIn your code, when you call `maxsum(nums, m)` and `maxsum(nums, n-m)`, you\\'re always starting from the beginning of the array, instead of dividing it into two parts. That\\'s why it\\'s causing the error.\\n\\nInstead of passing the length of the subarray, you should pass the starting and ending indices of the subarray. And when you\\'re making recursive calls, you should properly specify the start and end indices of the left and right subarrays.\\n\\nHere\\'s a corrected version of your function:\\n\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxsum(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {\\n        if(start == end)\\n            return nums[start];\\n\\n        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;\\n        int leftmaxsum = maxsum(nums, start, mid);\\n        int rightmaxsum = maxsum(nums, mid + 1, end);\\n\\n        int leftsum = INT_MIN, rightsum = INT_MIN, sum = 0;\\n        for(int i = mid; i >= start; i--) {\\n            sum += nums[i];\\n            leftsum = max(leftsum, sum);\\n        }\\n\\n        sum = 0;\\n        for(int i = mid + 1; i <= end; i++) {\\n            sum += nums[i];\\n            rightsum = max(rightsum, sum);\\n        }\\n\\n        int crosssum = leftsum + rightsum;\\n        return max(max(leftmaxsum, rightmaxsum), crosssum);\\n    }\\n\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n        return maxsum(nums, 0, n - 1);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThe divide and conquer approach works by dividing the array into two halves and solving the problem for each half. It then combines the solutions from each half by considering the maximum subarray sum that could cross the midpoint. The maximum of these three is returned as the final result. The time complexity is O(n log n) because it\\'s a divide and conquer strategy similar to merge sort. The space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursion stack."

However, there seems to be an issue with how the array is split in the recursive calls.\\n\\nIn your code, when you call `maxsum(nums, m)` and `maxsum(nums, n-m)`, you\\'re always starting from the beginning of the array, instead of dividing it into two parts. That\\'s why it\\'s causing the error.\\n\\nInstead of passing the length of the subarray, you should pass the starting and ending indices of the subarray. And when you\\'re making recursive calls, you should properly specify the start and end indices of the left and right subarrays.\\n\\nHere\\'s a corrected version of your function:\\n\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxsum(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {\\n        if(start == end)\\n            return nums[start];\\n\\n        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;\\n        int leftmaxsum = maxsum(nums, start, mid);\\n        int rightmaxsum = maxsum(nums, mid + 1, end);\\n\\n        int leftsum = INT_MIN, rightsum = INT_MIN, sum = 0;\\n        for(int i = mid; i >= start; i--) {\\n            sum += nums[i];\\n            leftsum = max(leftsum, sum);\\n        }\\n\\n        sum = 0;\\n        for(int i = mid + 1; i <= end; i++) {\\n            sum += nums[i];\\n            rightsum = max(rightsum, sum);\\n        }\\n\\n        int crosssum = leftsum + rightsum;\\n        return max(max(leftmaxsum, rightmaxsum), crosssum);\\n    }\\n\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n        return maxsum(nums, 0, n - 1);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThe divide and conquer approach works by dividing the array into two halves and solving the problem for each half. It then combines the solutions from each half by considering the maximum subarray sum that could cross the midpoint. The maximum of these three is returned as the final result. The time complexity is O(n log n) because it\\'s a divide and conquer strategy similar to merge sort. The space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursion stack."

Here\\'s a bit more detail:\\n\\n1. Initialize a variable `currSum` to 0 and `maxSum` to the smallest possible integer.\\n\\n2. Loop through each element in the array:\\n\\n    a. Add the current element to `currSum`.\\n\\n    b. If `currSum` becomes less than the current element\\'s value (which indicates that the sum of the current subarray is negative), reset `currSum` to the current element\\'s value. This effectively starts a new subarray.\\n\\n    c. If `currSum` is greater than `maxSum` (indicating that we\\'ve found a subarray with a larger sum), update `maxSum`.\\n\\n3. Once you\\'ve gone through the entire array, `maxSum` will hold the maximum subarray sum.\\n\\nThis approach leverages the insight that any subarray sum that becomes negative can\\'t contribute to a future subarray sum to make it larger. So, you\\'re better off starting a new subarray from the current position whenever you encounter a negative subarray sum. This is indeed a kind of greedy strategy, as you\\'re making the locally optimal choice at each step in the hopes that it will lead to a globally optimal solution."

However, there seems to be an issue with how the array is split in the recursive calls.\\n\\nIn your code, when you call `maxsum(nums, m)` and `maxsum(nums, n-m)`, you\\'re always starting from the beginning of the array, instead of dividing it into two parts. That\\'s why it\\'s causing the error.\\n\\nInstead of passing the length of the subarray, you should pass the starting and ending indices of the subarray. And when you\\'re making recursive calls, you should properly specify the start and end indices of the left and right subarrays.\\n\\nHere\\'s a corrected version of your function:\\n\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxsum(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {\\n        if(start == end)\\n            return nums[start];\\n\\n        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;\\n        int leftmaxsum = maxsum(nums, start, mid);\\n        int rightmaxsum = maxsum(nums, mid + 1, end);\\n\\n        int leftsum = INT_MIN, rightsum = INT_MIN, sum = 0;\\n        for(int i = mid; i >= start; i--) {\\n            sum += nums[i];\\n            leftsum = max(leftsum, sum);\\n        }\\n\\n        sum = 0;\\n        for(int i = mid + 1; i <= end; i++) {\\n            sum += nums[i];\\n            rightsum = max(rightsum, sum);\\n        }\\n\\n        int crosssum = leftsum + rightsum;\\n        return max(max(leftmaxsum, rightmaxsum), crosssum);\\n    }\\n\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n        return maxsum(nums, 0, n - 1);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThe divide and conquer approach works by dividing the array into two halves and solving the problem for each half. It then combines the solutions from each half by considering the maximum subarray sum that could cross the midpoint. The maximum of these three is returned as the final result. The time complexity is O(n log n) because it\\'s a divide and conquer strategy similar to merge sort. The space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursion stack."

Here\\'s a bit more detail:\\n\\n1. Initialize a variable `currSum` to 0 and `maxSum` to the smallest possible integer.\\n\\n2. Loop through each element in the array:\\n\\n    a. Add the current element to `currSum`.\\n\\n    b. If `currSum` becomes less than the current element\\'s value (which indicates that the sum of the current subarray is negative), reset `currSum` to the current element\\'s value. This effectively starts a new subarray.\\n\\n    c. If `currSum` is greater than `maxSum` (indicating that we\\'ve found a subarray with a larger sum), update `maxSum`.\\n\\n3. Once you\\'ve gone through the entire array, `maxSum` will hold the maximum subarray sum.\\n\\nThis approach leverages the insight that any subarray sum that becomes negative can\\'t contribute to a future subarray sum to make it larger. So, you\\'re better off starting a new subarray from the current position whenever you encounter a negative subarray sum. This is indeed a kind of greedy strategy, as you\\'re making the locally optimal choice at each step in the hopes that it will lead to a globally optimal solution."

However, there seems to be an issue with how the array is split in the recursive calls.\\n\\nIn your code, when you call `maxsum(nums, m)` and `maxsum(nums, n-m)`, you\\'re always starting from the beginning of the array, instead of dividing it into two parts. That\\'s why it\\'s causing the error.\\n\\nInstead of passing the length of the subarray, you should pass the starting and ending indices of the subarray. And when you\\'re making recursive calls, you should properly specify the start and end indices of the left and right subarrays.\\n\\nHere\\'s a corrected version of your function:\\n\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxsum(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {\\n        if(start == end)\\n            return nums[start];\\n\\n        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;\\n        int leftmaxsum = maxsum(nums, start, mid);\\n        int rightmaxsum = maxsum(nums, mid + 1, end);\\n\\n        int leftsum = INT_MIN, rightsum = INT_MIN, sum = 0;\\n        for(int i = mid; i >= start; i--) {\\n            sum += nums[i];\\n            leftsum = max(leftsum, sum);\\n        }\\n\\n        sum = 0;\\n        for(int i = mid + 1; i <= end; i++) {\\n            sum += nums[i];\\n            rightsum = max(rightsum, sum);\\n        }\\n\\n        int crosssum = leftsum + rightsum;\\n        return max(max(leftmaxsum, rightmaxsum), crosssum);\\n    }\\n\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n        return maxsum(nums, 0, n - 1);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThe divide and conquer approach works by dividing the array into two halves and solving the problem for each half. It then combines the solutions from each half by considering the maximum subarray sum that could cross the midpoint. The maximum of these three is returned as the final result. The time complexity is O(n log n) because it\\'s a divide and conquer strategy similar to merge sort. The space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursion stack."

Here\\'s a bit more detail:\\n\\n1. Initialize a variable `currSum` to 0 and `maxSum` to the smallest possible integer.\\n\\n2. Loop through each element in the array:\\n\\n    a. Add the current element to `currSum`.\\n\\n    b. If `currSum` becomes less than the current element\\'s value (which indicates that the sum of the current subarray is negative), reset `currSum` to the current element\\'s value. This effectively starts a new subarray.\\n\\n    c. If `currSum` is greater than `maxSum` (indicating that we\\'ve found a subarray with a larger sum), update `maxSum`.\\n\\n3. Once you\\'ve gone through the entire array, `maxSum` will hold the maximum subarray sum.\\n\\nThis approach leverages the insight that any subarray sum that becomes negative can\\'t contribute to a future subarray sum to make it larger. So, you\\'re better off starting a new subarray from the current position whenever you encounter a negative subarray sum. This is indeed a kind of greedy strategy, as you\\'re making the locally optimal choice at each step in the hopes that it will lead to a globally optimal solution."

Moreover, it\\'s not clear how these operations would help find the maximum product subarray, particularly in cases where negative numbers are involved.\\n\\nFor instance, consider the array [2, -3, 4, -5, -6].

Condensing the array: This step could be done in O(n), where n is the length of the original array, as you need to traverse the array only once. This operation won\\'t require any additional space (O(1)) because you can modify the original array.\\n\\n2.

The space complexity is also O(1) as you only need to keep track of the current maximum.\\n\\n3. Pairing up positive and negative numbers: This operation might be quite complex to implement, and it seems like it could potentially result in a time complexity of O(n^2) because in the worst-case scenario, you would need to rearrange elements after each pairing. Also, it\\'s unclear how this step contributes to finding the maximum product subarray.\\n\\nAs for the recursion part, the time complexity could get high, especially with the pairings and rearrangements. Moreover, it\\'s not clear how these operations would help find the maximum product subarray, particularly in cases where negative numbers are involved.\\n\\nFor instance, consider the array [2, -3, 4, -5, -6]. After condensing, you get the same array. The largest number is 4, but the maximum product subarray is [2, -3, 4, -5, -6] with a product of 360. The proposed operations don\\'t seem to capture this.\\n\\nThis problem is best solved using a dynamic programming approach, where for each new element, you calculate the maximum and minimum product ending at that position (to account for potential negative numbers), and then update the global maximum product accordingly.

It\\'s not beneficial, but it\\'s not reducing our maximum found so far (2), so we keep going.\\n\\nThe next number is 2, so our sum is now 2.

Adding these, we end up with a sum of 2, which is equal to our maximum.\\n\\nThe maximum subarray can thus be [2, -1, -1, 2] or [2, -1, -1, 2, 0, -3, 3] both resulting in a sum of 2. \\n\\nYou can see that we have included negative numbers in our subarray because, even though they momentarily decrease the sum, they may be part of a larger sum subarray.

Adding these, we end up with a sum of 2, which is equal to our maximum.\\n\\nThe maximum subarray can thus be [2, -1, -1, 2] or [2, -1, -1, 2, 0, -3, 3] both resulting in a sum of 2. \\n\\nYou can see that we have included negative numbers in our subarray because, even though they momentarily decrease the sum, they may be part of a larger sum subarray.

Condensing the array: This step could be done in O(n), where n is the length of the original array, as you need to traverse the array only once. This operation won\\'t require any additional space (O(1)) because you can modify the original array.\\n\\n2. Finding the largest number: This operation also runs in O(n) time complexity as you have to traverse the entire condensed array. The space complexity is also O(1) as you only need to keep track of the current maximum.\\n\\n3. Pairing up positive and negative numbers: This operation might be quite complex to implement, and it seems like it could potentially result in a time complexity of O(n^2) because in the worst-case scenario, you would need to rearrange elements after each pairing. Also, it\\'s unclear how this step contributes to finding the maximum product subarray.\\n\\nAs for the recursion part, the time complexity could get high, especially with the pairings and rearrangements. Moreover, it\\'s not clear how these operations would help find the maximum product subarray, particularly in cases where negative numbers are involved.\\n\\nFor instance, consider the array [2, -3, 4, -5, -6]. After condensing, you get the same array. The largest number is 4, but the maximum product subarray is [2, -3, 4, -5, -6] with a product of 360. The proposed operations don\\'t seem to capture this.\\n\\nThis problem is best solved using a dynamic programming approach, where for each new element, you calculate the maximum and minimum product ending at that position (to account for potential negative numbers), and then update the global maximum product accordingly. This can be done in O(n) time and O(1) space."

This is our current maximum.\\n\\nNext, we add -1, getting a sum of 1. Even though -1 is negative, adding it to our sum still results in a positive number, so we keep this subarray.\\n\\nThe next number is -1 again, our sum becomes 0. It\\'s not beneficial, but it\\'s not reducing our maximum found so far (2), so we keep going.\\n\\nThe next number is 2, so our sum is now 2. This is equal to our maximum found so far.\\n\\nThen we have 0, -3, and 3. Adding these, we end up with a sum of 2, which is equal to our maximum.\\n\\nThe maximum subarray can thus be [2, -1, -1, 2] or [2, -1, -1, 2, 0, -3, 3] both resulting in a sum of 2. \\n\\nYou can see that we have included negative numbers in our subarray because, even though they momentarily decrease the sum, they may be part of a larger sum subarray.

The operations you\\'re performing on the array don\\'t align with finding the maximum sum of a subarray. \\n\\nHere\\'s an example of a correct implementation using Kadane\\'s algorithm:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int max_sum = INT_MIN, curr_sum = 0;\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            curr_sum += nums[i];\\n            if (max_sum < curr_sum)\\n                max_sum = curr_sum;\\n            if (curr_sum < 0)\\n                curr_sum = 0;\\n        }\\n\\n        return max_sum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis implementation starts with `max_sum` set to the smallest possible integer and `curr_sum` set to 0. It iterates through the array, adding the current number to `curr_sum`. If `curr_sum` is larger than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated. If `curr_sum` becomes negative, it is reset to 0. At the end of the iteration, `max_sum` contains the maximum sum of a subarray in `nums`."

It is based on the principle of breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, solving them, and combining their results to find the solution to the original problem. Here\\'s a step by step breakdown:\\n\\n1. Divide the given array in two halves.\\n2. Return the maximum of the following three:\\n   * Maximum subarray sum in the left half (recursive call).\\n   * Maximum subarray sum in the right half (recursive call).\\n   * Maximum subarray sum such that the subarray crosses the midpoint.\\n\\nThe third case is handled differently. We first find the maximum sum starting from the mid point and ending at some point on the left half, then find the maximum sum starting from mid + 1 and ending at some point on the right half and finally combine the two.\\n\\nHere\\'s the C++ code that implements this:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int crossSum(vector<int>& nums, int left, int right, int mid) {\\n        if (left == right) return nums[left];\\n\\n        int leftSubsum = INT_MIN;\\n        int currSum = 0;\\n        for (int i = mid; i > left - 1; --i) {\\n            currSum += nums[i];\\n            leftSubsum = max(leftSubsum, currSum);\\n        }\\n\\n        int rightSubsum = INT_MIN;\\n        currSum = 0;\\n        for (int i = mid + 1; i < right + 1; ++i) {\\n            currSum += nums[i];\\n            rightSubsum = max(rightSubsum, currSum);\\n        }\\n\\n        return leftSubsum + rightSubsum;\\n    }\\n\\n    int helper(vector<int>& nums, int left, int right) {\\n        if (left == right) return nums[left];\\n\\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\\n\\n        int leftSum = helper(nums, left, mid);\\n        int rightSum = helper(nums, mid + 1, right);\\n        int crossSum = this->crossSum(nums, left, right, mid);\\n\\n        return max(max(leftSum, rightSum), crossSum);\\n    }\\n\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        return helper(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\nIn the code above, `crossSum` calculates the maximum subarray sum that crosses the midpoint, `helper` performs the recursive division of the array and calculates the maximum subarray sums, and `maxSubArray` is the main function that calls `helper` to start the recursion. The result of `maxSubArray` is the maximum subarray sum in the input array `nums`."

So, it should be `vector<int> a(nums.size(), 0);` instead of `vector a(nums.size(), 0);`.\\n\\n2. Invalid Indexing: The line `nums[i] = nums[i] + nums[n-i];` could result in accessing elements beyond the array when `i = 0`. Because `n-i` when `i = 0` would give `n`, and `nums[n]` is out of bounds.\\n\\n3. Incorrect Logic: The logic you are using doesn\\'t seem to follow the Kadane\\'s algorithm, which is the recommended approach for the maximum subarray problem. The operations you\\'re performing on the array don\\'t align with finding the maximum sum of a subarray. \\n\\nHere\\'s an example of a correct implementation using Kadane\\'s algorithm:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int max_sum = INT_MIN, curr_sum = 0;\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            curr_sum += nums[i];\\n            if (max_sum < curr_sum)\\n                max_sum = curr_sum;\\n            if (curr_sum < 0)\\n                curr_sum = 0;\\n        }\\n\\n        return max_sum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis implementation starts with `max_sum` set to the smallest possible integer and `curr_sum` set to 0. It iterates through the array, adding the current number to `curr_sum`. If `curr_sum` is larger than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated. If `curr_sum` becomes negative, it is reset to 0. At the end of the iteration, `max_sum` contains the maximum sum of a subarray in `nums`."

Invalid Indexing: The line `nums[i] = nums[i] + nums[n-i];` could result in accessing elements beyond the array when `i = 0`. Because `n-i` when `i = 0` would give `n`, and `nums[n]` is out of bounds.\\n\\n3. Incorrect Logic: The logic you are using doesn\\'t seem to follow the Kadane\\'s algorithm, which is the recommended approach for the maximum subarray problem. The operations you\\'re performing on the array don\\'t align with finding the maximum sum of a subarray. \\n\\nHere\\'s an example of a correct implementation using Kadane\\'s algorithm:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int max_sum = INT_MIN, curr_sum = 0;\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            curr_sum += nums[i];\\n            if (max_sum < curr_sum)\\n                max_sum = curr_sum;\\n            if (curr_sum < 0)\\n                curr_sum = 0;\\n        }\\n\\n        return max_sum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis implementation starts with `max_sum` set to the smallest possible integer and `curr_sum` set to 0. It iterates through the array, adding the current number to `curr_sum`. If `curr_sum` is larger than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated. If `curr_sum` becomes negative, it is reset to 0. At the end of the iteration, `max_sum` contains the maximum sum of a subarray in `nums`."

It is based on the principle of breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, solving them, and combining their results to find the solution to the original problem. Here\\'s a step by step breakdown:\\n\\n1. Divide the given array in two halves.\\n2. Return the maximum of the following three:\\n   * Maximum subarray sum in the left half (recursive call).\\n   * Maximum subarray sum in the right half (recursive call).\\n   * Maximum subarray sum such that the subarray crosses the midpoint.\\n\\nThe third case is handled differently. We first find the maximum sum starting from the mid point and ending at some point on the left half, then find the maximum sum starting from mid + 1 and ending at some point on the right half and finally combine the two.\\n\\nHere\\'s the C++ code that implements this:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int crossSum(vector<int>& nums, int left, int right, int mid) {\\n        if (left == right) return nums[left];\\n\\n        int leftSubsum = INT_MIN;\\n        int currSum = 0;\\n        for (int i = mid; i > left - 1; --i) {\\n            currSum += nums[i];\\n            leftSubsum = max(leftSubsum, currSum);\\n        }\\n\\n        int rightSubsum = INT_MIN;\\n        currSum = 0;\\n        for (int i = mid + 1; i < right + 1; ++i) {\\n            currSum += nums[i];\\n            rightSubsum = max(rightSubsum, currSum);\\n        }\\n\\n        return leftSubsum + rightSubsum;\\n    }\\n\\n    int helper(vector<int>& nums, int left, int right) {\\n        if (left == right) return nums[left];\\n\\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\\n\\n        int leftSum = helper(nums, left, mid);\\n        int rightSum = helper(nums, mid + 1, right);\\n        int crossSum = this->crossSum(nums, left, right, mid);\\n\\n        return max(max(leftSum, rightSum), crossSum);\\n    }\\n\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        return helper(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\nIn the code above, `crossSum` calculates the maximum subarray sum that crosses the midpoint, `helper` performs the recursive division of the array and calculates the maximum subarray sums, and `maxSubArray` is the main function that calls `helper` to start the recursion. The result of `maxSubArray` is the maximum subarray sum in the input array `nums`."

This approach works fine for arrays that have at least one positive number, because the maximum sum will always be greater than 0. However, if the array contains only negative numbers (like in your case `nums[] = {-1}`), then the maximum sum will be the maximum (or least negative) number in the array.\\n\\nTo handle this case, you should check whether `cs` is greater than `ms` before resetting `cs` to 0. Here is the corrected code:\\n\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n        int ms = Integer.MIN_VALUE ;\\n        int cs = 0 ;\\n        for(int i=0 ; i<nums.length; i++){\\n            cs += nums[i] ;\\n            ms = Math.max(cs , ms);\\n            if(cs < 0){\\n                cs = 0 ;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ms ;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis code works by first updating `ms` with the maximum of `cs` and `ms`, and then checking if `cs` has fallen below 0. If it has, `cs` is reset to 0. By updating `ms` before the check, you ensure that `ms` receives the highest sum encountered, even if that sum is negative."

Here is the corrected code:\\n\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n        int ms = Integer.MIN_VALUE ;\\n        int cs = 0 ;\\n        for(int i=0 ; i<nums.length; i++){\\n            cs += nums[i] ;\\n            ms = Math.max(cs , ms);\\n            if(cs < 0){\\n                cs = 0 ;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ms ;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis code works by first updating `ms` with the maximum of `cs` and `ms`, and then checking if `cs` has fallen below 0. If it has, `cs` is reset to 0. By updating `ms` before the check, you ensure that `ms` receives the highest sum encountered, even if that sum is negative."

However, if the array contains only negative numbers (like in your case `nums[] = {-1}`), then the maximum sum will be the maximum (or least negative) number in the array.\\n\\nTo handle this case, you should check whether `cs` is greater than `ms` before resetting `cs` to 0.

However, your current implementation would return `7`, which is the sum of the entire array from the beginning to the second-to-last element.\\n\\nTo solve this problem, you could use Kadane\\'s algorithm, which involves keeping track of the current subarray sum and the maximum subarray sum seen so far:\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        max_sum = nums[0]\\n        curr_sum = nums[0]\\n        for num in nums[1:]:\\n            curr_sum = max(num, curr_sum + num)\\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)\\n        return max_sum\\n```\\n\\nThis algorithm works by iterating through the array, and at each step, it decides whether to add the current element to the previous subarray or start a new subarray from the current element. It also keeps track of the maximum subarray sum seen so far."

Here is the corrected code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int maxsum = INT_MIN;\\n        int currsum = 0;\\n\\n        for(int i = 0; i<nums.size(); i++){\\n            currsum += nums[i];\\n            maxsum = max(maxsum, currsum);\\n\\n            if(currsum < 0){\\n                currsum = 0;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return maxsum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nNow, `maxsum` is updated with the maximum sum found so far before `currsum` is reset to 0. This way, even if all numbers in the array are negative, `maxsum` will hold the maximum (least negative) number."

However, your current implementation would return `7`, which is the sum of the entire array from the beginning to the second-to-last element.\\n\\nTo solve this problem, you could use Kadane\\'s algorithm, which involves keeping track of the current subarray sum and the maximum subarray sum seen so far:\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        max_sum = nums[0]\\n        curr_sum = nums[0]\\n        for num in nums[1:]:\\n            curr_sum = max(num, curr_sum + num)\\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)\\n        return max_sum\\n```\\n\\nThis algorithm works by iterating through the array, and at each step, it decides whether to add the current element to the previous subarray or start a new subarray from the current element. It also keeps track of the maximum subarray sum seen so far."

Here is the corrected code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int maxsum = INT_MIN;\\n        int currsum = 0;\\n\\n        for(int i = 0; i<nums.size(); i++){\\n            currsum += nums[i];\\n            maxsum = max(maxsum, currsum);\\n\\n            if(currsum < 0){\\n                currsum = 0;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return maxsum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nNow, `maxsum` is updated with the maximum sum found so far before `currsum` is reset to 0. This way, even if all numbers in the array are negative, `maxsum` will hold the maximum (least negative) number."

However, your current implementation would return `7`, which is the sum of the entire array from the beginning to the second-to-last element.\\n\\nTo solve this problem, you could use Kadane\\'s algorithm, which involves keeping track of the current subarray sum and the maximum subarray sum seen so far:\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        max_sum = nums[0]\\n        curr_sum = nums[0]\\n        for num in nums[1:]:\\n            curr_sum = max(num, curr_sum + num)\\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)\\n        return max_sum\\n```\\n\\nThis algorithm works by iterating through the array, and at each step, it decides whether to add the current element to the previous subarray or start a new subarray from the current element. It also keeps track of the maximum subarray sum seen so far."

Here is the corrected code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int maxsum = INT_MIN;\\n        int currsum = 0;\\n\\n        for(int i = 0; i<nums.size(); i++){\\n            currsum += nums[i];\\n            maxsum = max(maxsum, currsum);\\n\\n            if(currsum < 0){\\n                currsum = 0;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return maxsum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nNow, `maxsum` is updated with the maximum sum found so far before `currsum` is reset to 0. This way, even if all numbers in the array are negative, `maxsum` will hold the maximum (least negative) number."

A better way is to use Kadane\\'s algorithm as mentioned before.\\n\\nIn addition, your current approach uses `maxSum=0` as a starting value, which means it will not work correctly if all numbers in the array are negative, because the maximum sum would be less than zero. \\n\\nInstead of starting `maxSum` at `0`, you should start it at the smallest possible integer value, `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which guarantees that any sum of subarray will be larger than the initial `maxSum`. Here\\'s how you can modify your code:\\n\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {\\n        int sum = 0;\\n        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\\n        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){\\n            sum += nums[i];\\n            if(sum > maxSum){\\n                maxSum = sum;\\n            }\\n            if(sum < 0){\\n                sum = 0;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return maxSum;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis code initializes `maxSum` to `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and updates `maxSum` whenever `sum` is greater than `maxSum`. If `sum` becomes negative, it resets `sum` to `0` because no max subarray sum would include a negative sum."
