                "content": "The key observation is that the quotient of a division is just the number of times that we can subtract the `divisor` from the `dividend` without making it negative.\\n\\nSuppose `dividend = 15` and `divisor = 3`, `15 - 3 > 0`. We now try to subtract more by *shifting* `3` to the left by `1` bit (`6`). Since `15 - 6 > 0`, shift `6` again to `12`. Now `15 - 12 > 0`, shift `12` again to `24`, which is larger than `15`. So we can at most subtract `12` from `15`. Since `12` is obtained by shifting `3` to left twice, it is `1 << 2 = 4` times of `3`. We add `4` to an answer variable (initialized to be `0`). The above process is like `15 = 3 * 4 + 3`. We now get part of the quotient (`4`), with a remaining dividend `3`.\\n\\nThen we repeat the above process by subtracting `divisor = 3` from the remaining `dividend = 3` and obtain `0`. We are done. In this case, no shift happens. We simply add `1 << 0 = 1` to the answer variable.\\n\\nThis is the full algorithm to perform division using bit manipulations. The sign also needs to be taken into consideration. And we still need to handle one overflow case: `dividend = INT_MIN` and `divisor = -1`.\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n        if (dividend == INT_MIN && divisor == -1) {\\n            return INT_MAX;\\n        }\\n        long dvd = labs(dividend), dvs = labs(divisor), ans = 0;\\n        int sign = dividend > 0 ^ divisor > 0 ? -1 : 1;\\n        while (dvd >= dvs) {\\n            long temp = dvs, m = 1;\\n            while (temp << 1 <= dvd) {\\n                temp <<= 1;\\n                m <<= 1;\\n            }\\n            dvd -= temp;\\n            ans += m;\\n        }\\n        return sign * ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "# **Explanation:**\\n```\\n\\tdividend = (quotient) * divisor + remainder\\n```\\nWe have to find the quotient in this equation and we are given divisor and dividend.\\nAny number can be represented in binary form. Same goes for `quotient` :\\n\\nLet us have an example: `58/5`:\\n`58 = (11) * 5 + 3`\\nRepresenting the quotient in binary form:  (11)<sub>10</sub> = (1011)<sub>2</sub>:\\n```\\n\\t58 = (2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0) * 5 + 3                // --- (I)\\n\\t58 = [(2^3 * 5) + (2^1 * 5) + (2^0 * 5)] + 3  // --- (II)\\n```\\n\\nSince we dont know the quotient and remainder the equation we know is:\\n`58 = (q) * 5 + rem`\\n\\nWe get a hint at what we would like to do here. We will first multiply 5 with maximum power of 2 such that the resulting number is still smaller than the dividend (read further if you don\\'t understand why). Since multiplication operator is not allowed, we would use bitwise left shift to achieve this multiplication: each time we shift 5 by 1, we multiply it by 2:\\n```\\n\\t5 << 0 = 5               // less than dividend\\n\\t5 << 1 = 5*2 = 10        // less than dividend\\n\\t5 << 2 = 5*2*2 = 20      // less than dividend\\n\\t5 << 3 = 5*2*2*2 = 40    // less than dividend\\n\\t5 << 4 = 5*2*2*2*2 = 80  // (stop and consider the previous value as the result is greater than dividend\\n```\\n\\nWe observe that:\\n`58 = (2^3 * 5) + (something * 5) + rem      // --- (III)`\\nYou can see we are getting close to the equation we initialy wanted (eqa II). \\n\\nSince 5 is multiplied with 2<sup>3</sup>, ***we add 2<sup>3</sup> to our answer***.\\nFurther operating on equation III:\\n```\\n\\t58 - (2^3 * 5)  =  (something * 5) + rem\\n\\t58 - (8 * 5) = something * 5 + rem\\n\\t58 - 40 = something * 5 + rem\\n\\t18 = something * 5 + rem\\n```\\n\\nWhat we effectively have done is, subtracted the result we got from our first step from dividend `(58 - 40)`.\\nWe arived at the same question again but with a smaller dividend this time. \\n`dividend = 18, divisor = 5`\\n\\nTherefore let us repeat the process:\\n```\\n\\t5 << 0 = 5           // less than dividend\\n\\t5 << 1 = 5*2 = 10    // less than dividend\\n\\t5 << 2 = 5*2*2 = 20  // (stop and consider the previous value as the result is greater than dividend\\n```\\n***We add  2<sup>1</sup> to our answer***.\\nLooking back: \\n```\\n\\t18  =  (2^1 * 5) + (something * 5) + rem\\n\\t58 - (2^3 * 5) = (2^1 * 5) + (something * 5) + rem\\n\\t58 =  (2^3 * 5) + (2^1 * 5) + (something * 5) + rem\\n```\\nYou can notice we are gradually advancing towards equ II:\\nOur new dividend is now:\\n```\\n\\t18 - (2^1 * 5)  =  (something * 5) + rem\\n\\t18 - (2 * 5) = something * 5 + rem\\n\\t18 - 10 = something * 5 + rem\\n\\t8 = something * 5 + rem\\n```\\n`dividend = 8, divisor = 5`\\nRepeating the process:\\n```\\n\\t5 << 0 = 5           // less than dividend\\n\\t5 << 1 = 5*2 = 10    // (stop and consider the previous value as the result is greater than dividend\\n```\\n***We add  2<sup>0</sup> to our answer.***\\nNew dividend: \\n```\\n\\t8 = (2^0 * 5) + (something * 5) + rem\\n\\t8 - 5 = something * 5 + rem\\n\\t3 = something * 5 + rem\\n```\\n`dividend = 3, divisor = 5`\\nAt this step, we stop iterating as our dividend is less than the divisor (we have also found our remainder = 3, as 5 should be multiplied with 0 and what remains is the remainder).\\n\\nLooking back again for the last time:\\n```\\n\\t3 = 0*5 + rem\\n\\t8 = (2^0 * 5) + 3\\n\\t18  =  (2^0 * 5) + (2^1 * 5) + 3\\n\\t58 = (2^3 * 5) + (2^1 * 5) + (2^0 * 5) + 3\\n```\\nIn the process, we have finally reached the equation we wanted to, and have got the answer as:\\n`quotient = (2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0)`\\n\\n# **Code:**\\nSince we are not allowed to have any numerical data type bigger than 32 bit integer, we will use the last bit reserved for sign to avoid overflow by using the unsinged int in c++:\\n```\\n\\tint divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n        if(dividend == divisor)\\n            return 1;\\n        bool isPositive = (dividend<0 == divisor<0);    // if both are of same sign, answer is positive\\n        unsigned int a = abs(dividend);\\n        unsigned int b = abs(divisor);\\n        unsigned int ans = 0;\\n        while(a >= b){  // while dividend is greater than or equal to divisor\\n            short q = 0;\\n            while(a > (b<<(q+1)))\\n                q++;\\n            ans += (1<<q);  // add the power of 2 found to the answer\\n            a = a - (b<<q);  // reduce the dividend by divisor * power of 2 found\\n        }\\n        if(ans == (1<<31) and isPositive)   // if ans cannot be stored in signed int\\n            return INT_MAX;\\n        return isPositive ? ans : -ans;\\n    }\\n```\\n***Please upvote if you find this helpful, or if you think someone else might find it useful :)***\\n\\n",

I had to spend a lots of time to understand the secret behind the solutions to this problem. \\n\\nFirst of all, As we all know already the basic idea for solving the problem with out the mod operator is simply **identifying the number of times the divisor can fully SUBSTRACT the dividend as a whole** but iterations are so costly and it will not work for large numbers. The obvious secret is to identify **effective way to reduce the number of substractions**\\n\\nThe following is simply my idea but there can be many as well, \\n\\n**1. Exponensly increase the divisor until before it surpass the dividend then substract with it.\\n2. Add up the divisor and find the remainder.\\n3. Repeat the same until it brings to 0**\\n\\nFor an example, 116 divided by 3, Following is the way to gradually reduce the possibilities and idendify the final quotient\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/31c9c3ac-8bd5-437a-a976-ad74d369e0f0_1624215160.6451015.png)\\n\\nLets start with 3, then double it which is 6 then 12, 24,..until we stop at 96 because 192 can be substracted. So here 96 == 3 * 2^5 ==  3 << 5 and quotient = 32, remainder = 20\\n\\nLet start the same process again with 20, it can go upto which gets to 12 == 3 * 2^2 == 3 << 2 then the quotient is now 32 + 4 = 36, reminder = 8\\n\\nLets start over again, i can go upto 6 which is again 6 == 3 * 2^1 == 3 << 1 the quotient is not 36+2 = 38, remainder = 2 which is less than divisor so we can not continue with the cycle and all ends here.\\n\\nHowever multiplication is not allowed to use let see what else we can do for replacing it. \\n\\n**Programmatic Rule:**\\nLeft Shift (<<) shall be considered as multiplication by 2^N\\nSimilarly, Right Shift (>>) shall be considered as division by 2^N \\n\\nSince the environment only allows to accomodate `integer`  data type, overflow cases are the corner cases.\\n\\nLets dive into the code,\\n\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n     public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n        if (dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE && divisor == -1) return Integer.MAX_VALUE; //Cornor case when -2^31 is divided by -1 will give 2^31 which doesnt exist so overflow \\n         \\n        boolean negative = dividend < 0 ^ divisor < 0; //Logical XOR will help in deciding if the results is negative only if any one of them is negative\\n        \\n        dividend = Math.abs(dividend);\\n        divisor = Math.abs(divisor);\\n        int quotient = 0, subQuot = 0;\\n        \\n        while (dividend - divisor >= 0) {\\n            for (subQuot = 0; dividend - (divisor << subQuot << 1) >= 0; subQuot++);\\n            quotient += 1 << subQuot; //Add to the quotient\\n            dividend -= divisor << subQuot; //Substract from dividend to start over with the remaining\\n        }\\n        return negative ? -quotient : quotient;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n",

What we can use if we can not use multiplications and divisions: we can use only addition and subtraction. Let consider an example:\\n`100 // 7`\\n\\nWe can try just to subtract `7` while it is possible.  However potentially it can be quite long, if `dividend` is big and `divisor` is small. Let us multiply `7` by `2` (in fact it is not multiplication, but addition with itself), until we are smaller than `100`.  `7 -> 14 -> 28 -> 56`. Ans subtract `56` now, so we have `8` as result and we need to divide `44` by `7` now. Repeat procedure, so we subtract `28`, and we have `8 + 4` as result and `44 - 28 = 16 = 2`. Finally, we subtract `14` and we have `8 + 4 + 2 = 14` as result.\\n\\nLet us precalculate pairs `(7, 1), (14, 2), (28, 4), (56, 8)`. Then we iterate through these pairs in opposite direction and if we can subtract corresponding number, we subtract, if not - we go to the next one. Also we need to deal with signs and overflows here.\\n\\n**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(log n)`, where `n = divident/divisor`: there will be `O(log n)` terms in our `cand` list as well as this is limit for number of steps.

                "content": "I took the code of  [@tusizi](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/discuss/13403/Clear-python-code) and made it easier to understand by changing variable names, and adding a detailed explanation for each line. I\\'m also not experienced myself and whatever I right here comes from discussion forums and googling. The high level idea is that you substract `dividend` by `divisor` until `dividend` is less than `divisor`.  Also, the solution has two `while` loops. The inner `while` loop tries to substract `divisor`, `2*divisor`, `4*divisor` and so on, until `dividend` is less than `divisor` where it starts over the outer `while` loop. \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n# @return an integer\\ndef divide(self, dividend, divisor):\\n    positive = (dividend < 0) is (divisor < 0) # 1\\n    dividend, divisor = abs(dividend), abs(divisor) # 2\\n    res = 0 # 3\\n    while dividend >= divisor: # 4\\n            curr_divisor, num_divisors = divisor, 1 # 5\\n            while dividend >= curr_divisor: # 6\\n                dividend -= curr_divisor # 7\\n                res += num_divisors # 8\\n                \\n                curr_divisor = curr_divisor << 1 # 9\\n                num_divisors = num_divisors << 1 # 10\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n    if not positive: # 11\\n        res = -res # 12\\n\\t\\t\\n    return min(max(-2147483648, res), 2147483647) # 13\\n```\\n\\n`#1`: `is` operator is similar to `==` operator except that it compares that whether both the operands refer to the same object or not. check [this](https://www.***.org/difference-operator-python/).\\nSo here, if both of `dividend` and `divisor` have similar sign, it returns `True`. Otherwise, `False`. This will be used in line `#11` when we check if the `positive` variable is `True` or `False`. And, if it\\'s not `True` (meaning if they don\\'t have similar signs, we add a `-` to the output (`#12`). Note that in this example `==` works just fine as `is`. \\n\\n`#2`: No that we decided on the sign in line `#1`, we can use absolute values of `dividend` and `divisor`. That\\'s what\\'s being done here. \\n\\n`#3`: Initiating the output by setting it to zero. \\n\\n`#4`: So the high level idea is that we substract `divisor` from `dividend` until we can\\'t substract anymore. Imagine you want to divide 7 by 2. 7-2 =5, 5-2=3, 3-2 = 1 ! You can\\'t substract anymore. Them the `while` loope stops. \\n\\n`#5`: Now, we enter the main (tricky, challenging, confusing) part of the code. This line is not complicated. It simply initilize some values, meaning `curr_divisor` and `num_divisors\\' with `divisor` and `1`, recpectively. This means we assume `curr_divisor = divisor` and `num_divisor = 1`, initially. \\n\\n`#7` and `#8`: These two lines are updating `dividend` and `res`. When you substract `dividend` by `curr_divisor`, you\\'re basically saying if I was going to calculating the quotient of division, I could still cut another piece with the size of `divisor` from `dividend`, and that\\'s why you update the `res` variable by num_divisor (`res += num_divisors` means `res = res + num_divisors`). \\n\\n`#9` and `#10`: `currdivisor = currdivisor << 1` is the same as `currdivisor = currdivisor  2`, and `numdivisors = numdivisors << 1`, is the same as`numdivisors = numdivisors2`. This is called bitwise operation. Check [this](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators). `<<` sign is left-shifting bitwise operator which shift bits in binary of a number by one to the left. Imaging you have number 4, (`bin(4) = 0b100`)! doing `4 >> 1` make the new binary `1000` (shifted to the left by 1 and added a zero to the rightmost bit) which is the binary for 8. The reason it tries to do the multiplicaion is to fasten the process. From [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/discuss/13403/Clear-python-code/329694), A naive method here is to repeatedly subtract divisor from dividend, until there is none enough left. Then the count of subtractions will be the answer. Yet this takes linear time and is thus slow. A better method is to subtract divisor in a more efficient way. We can subtract divisor, 2divisor, 4divisor, 8*divisor... as is implemented above. .It will go to the outer loop once it cannot substract anymore of `curr_divisor` from `dividend`, and set the `curr_divisor = divisor` and tries the actual divisor (no 2  multiplications). \\n\\n`#13`: We are told by problem statement to limit the output to 32-bit integers, meaning the `res` parameter fall in the [-2^31, 2*^31-1] range. Here, the line has two components. First, it compares output (`res`) with -2^31 value and return the max of the two since we don\\'t want values less than -2^31. Next, it compares the value from `max(-2147483648, res)` with the maximum allowable value (meaning 2^31). So, if we put `a = max(-2147483648, res)`, then it does `min(a, 2147483647)` and return the min of two since we\\'re not allowed to go above 2^31 = 2147483647 number. \\n\\n=========================================\\n\\nFinal note: In order to fully understand the code, I suggest to grab a piece of paper and pen (or write on a notepad or something similar in out laptop/pc) and write a simple example and try to pass through the algorithm by hand. Here is an example from [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/discuss/13403/Clear-python-code/144026). \\n\\nLet\\'s take an example: `50 / 4`\\nAt the start,\\n`curr_divisor, num_divisors = divisor, 1` # dividend = 50, curr_divisor = 4, num_divisors = 1\\n`dividend -= curr_divisor` # dividend = 46, curr_divisor = 4 ,num_divisors = 1\\n`res += num_divisors` # res = 1\\n`num_divisors <<= 1 ` # dividend = 46, curr_divisor = 4 , num_divisors = 2\\n`curr_divisor <<= 1` # dividend = 46, curr_divisor = 8 , num_divisors = 2\\n\\nSecond iteration:\\n`dividend -= curr_divisor` # dividend = 38, curr_divisor = 8 , num_divisors= 2\\n`res += num_divisors` # res = 3\\n`num_divisors <<= 1` # dividend = 38, curr_divisor = 8 , num_divisors = 3\\n`curr_divisor <<= 1` # dividend = 38, curr_divisor = 12 ,  num_divisors = 3\\n\\nand so on, when `dividend > curr_divisor`, we start over again with `curr_divisor = 4`, and `num_divisors = 1`\\n\\n\\n===========================================================================\\nFinal note 2: Since I believe if I could explain something to others in a simple manner, it would be helpful to me, I try to add more posts like this as I move forward through my leetcode journey. \\n\\nFinal note 3: There might be some typos in the writing above!!",

If you like this solution or find it useful,* ***please upvote*** *this post.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Idea:***\\n\\nThe first thing we should be able to understand is that one of the operations increases **X** while the other one decreases it. So the natural tendency is to think about the solution in terms of applying these operations in order. That is, multiply as many times as you need to before subtracting as many times as you need to.\\n\\nWe see that that\\'s not a viable solution, however, once we recognize that one of the operations is quite obviously multiplicative rather than additive, meaning that a subtraction done *before* a multiplication has twice the impact, for example.\\n\\nSo the trick here is to think of the problem backwards: moving from **Y** to **X** instead of from **X** to **Y**. If **Y** is odd, we\\'re forced to do the additive operation (reversed from the subtractive operation) as we can\\'t divide an odd number by **2** and be able to reach **X**. If **Y** is even, we can prioritize the division operation instead. At each step we can increment our **ans**.\\n\\nOnce **Y** drops below **X**, the remaining difference must be made via the additive operation, so we can just **return** that difference plus **ans**.\\n\\n**To illustrate why the backwards order leads to the correct solution**, let\\'s take a look at an example: **X = 3, Y = 13**. Under the naive approach discussed at the very beginning of this section, we could apply the multiplication operation **3** times to achieve **24**, then apply the subtraction operation **11** times to bring **Y** back down to **13**.\\n\\nAs we observed before, that **11** is not very efficient, considering that some/all of those subtraction operations could have been done before some/all of the multiplication operations with greater impact.\\n\\nSo what if we had applied as many of those operations as necessary just *before* the last of the three multiplications? Then we would only have needed **5** operations to effect **10** subtraction, plus the leftover **1** to get to **11** at the end.\\n\\nIf we go back one more step before the second of three multiplications, we could have instead done **2** operations then which would have the effect of **8** substraction, plus an extra operation after the second multiplication (adding another **2** subtraction), plus the final operation after all multiplications to reach **11**.\\n\\nThis quickly begins to represent a binary representation of our target difference of **11**:\\n```js\\n     Total multiplications:                                 In binary: (11 = 1011)\\n        3    2    1    0\\n                      11   =   11 in 11 operations                   1011   =   11\\n                  5    1   =   11 in 6 operations                 101 + 1   =   6\\n             2    1    1   =   11 in 4 operations              10 + 1 + 1   =   4\\n        1    0    1    1   =   11 in 3 operations           1 + 0 + 1 + 1   =   3\\n```\\nWe can already see that this is starting to look like our backwards approach. At each additional multiplication operation available, we\\'re forced to perform a subtraction operation if the difference is still odd, otherwise, we can divide the remainder by **2** and push it back one multiplication earlier.\\n\\nBasically, for each multiplication we need to take **X** over **Y**, we take the remaining difference, count the first bit, then shift the difference to the right. And that should sound *exactly* like our backwards approach, because the first bit is a **0** if even and **1** if odd, and shifting to the right is the same as dividing by **2**.\\n\\n**So why can\\'t we go forwards with X instead of backwards with Y?** As mentioned before, the multiplication operation is, quite obviously, multiplicative, and will have an enhancing effect on any subtraction operations performed before it. Therefore, *we cannot possibly know* how much impact any given subtraction operation will have on the difference between **X** and **Y** until we find out how many multiplication operations we will need after it.\\n\\nSo any solution involving moving **X** to **Y** would at least require \"peeking\" ahead at part of the solution before progressing with the subtraction operations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Implementation:***\\n\\nThis solution is almost identical in all four languages.\\n\\nPython will convert our integer into a float if we simply divide by 2, so we can use the floor division operator instead to maintain the integer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Javascript Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **68ms / 38.2MB** (beats 100% / 90%).\\n```javascript\\nvar brokenCalc = function(X, Y) {\\n    let ans = 0\\n    while (X < Y) {\\n        ans++\\n        if (Y % 2) Y++\\n        else Y /= 2\\n    }\\n    return X - Y + ans\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Python Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **20ms / 14.1MB** (beats 99% / 90%).\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def brokenCalc(self, X: int, Y: int) -> int:\\n        ans = 0\\n        while X < Y:\\n            ans += 1\\n            if Y % 2: Y += 1\\n            else: Y //= 2\\n        return X - Y + ans\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Java Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 35.4MB** (beats 100% / 98%).\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int brokenCalc(int X, int Y) {\\n        int ans = 0;\\n        while (X < Y) {\\n            ans++;\\n            if (Y % 2 > 0) Y++;\\n            else Y /= 2;\\n        }\\n        return X - Y + ans;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***C++ Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 5.8MB** (beats 100% / 81%).\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int brokenCalc(int X, int Y) {\\n        int ans = 0;\\n        while (X < Y) {\\n            ans++;\\n            if (Y % 2) Y++;\\n            else Y /= 2;\\n        }\\n        return X - Y + ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

All that\\'s left is to start over with the remaining amount of **A** and repeat this process, adding the results to our answer (**ans**) as we go.\\n\\nOf course, negative numbers will play havoc with our bitwise shifting, so we should first extract the **sign** difference and then use only positive numbers for **A** and **B**.\\n\\nThere\\'s also the stated edge case, which only occurs at one permutation of **A** and **B**, so we can handle that at the outset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Alternate Idea:***\\n\\nFor those who consider bitwise shifts to be too close to multiplication/division, we can instead use the rules of **logarithms** to our advantage:\\n```c++\\n  if:  exp(log(c) = c                   // Logarithmic rule #1\\n  if:  log(a / b) = log(a) - log(b)     // Logarithmic rule #2\\n\\nthen:  a / b = exp(log(a / b))          // From rule #1\\n       a / b = exp(log(a) - log(b))     // From rule #2\\n\\n       (if m and n are > 0)\\n```\\nSince we\\'ll have to use the absolute values of **A** and **B**, we\\'ll have to define the same edge cases as in the earlier solutions. Finally, we\\'ll also have to apply a **floor()** to the result to truncate the decimal before we **return ans**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Implementation:***\\n\\nJavascript and Python both handle numbers larger than **32-bit** internally, and Java requires only a small change to the conditions on its loops to avoid an issue.\\n\\nC++, on the other hand, adheres strictly to the **32-bit** limit, so we have to define a few more edge cases to avoid exceeding these boundaries. That does allow us to simplify the code for both loops, however.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Javascript Code w/ Bit Manipulation:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **84ms / 39.8MB** (beats 99% / 96%).\\n```javascript\\nvar divide = function(A, B) {\\n    if (A === -2147483648 && B === -1) return 2147483647\\n    let ans = 0, sign = 1\\n    if (A < 0) A = -A, sign = -sign\\n    if (B < 0) B = -B, sign = -sign\\n    if (A === B) return sign\\n    for (let i = 0, val = B; A >= B; i = 0, val = B) {\\n        while (val > 0 && val <= A) val = B << ++i\\n        A -= B << i - 1, ans += 1 << i - 1\\n    }\\n    return sign < 0 ? -ans : ans\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Javascript Code w/ Logarithms:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **84ms / 40.1MB** (beats 99% / 63%).\\n```javascript\\nvar divide = function(A, B) {\\n    let ans = 0\\n    if (B === -2147483648) return A === B\\n    if (A === -2147483648)\\n        if (B === 1) return -2147483648\\n        else if (B === -1) return 2147483647\\n        else A += Math.abs(B), ans++\\n    ans += Math.floor(Math.exp(Math.log(Math.abs(A)) - Math.log(Math.abs(B))))\\n    return A > 0 === B > 0 ? ans : -ans\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Python Code w/ Bit Manipulation:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **20ms / 14.0MB** (beats 100% / 95%).\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def divide(self, A: int, B: int) -> int:\\n        if A == -2147483648 and B == -1: return 2147483647\\n        ans, sign = 0, 1\\n        if A < 0: A, sign = -A, -sign\\n        if B < 0: B, sign = -B, -sign\\n        if A == B: return sign\\n        while A >= B:\\n            b = 0\\n            while B << b <= A: b += 1\\n            A -= B << b - 1\\n            ans += 1 << b - 1\\n        return -ans if sign < 0 else ans\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Python Code w/ Logarithms:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **28ms / 14.1MB** (beats 92% / 95%).\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def divide(self, A: int, B: int) -> int:\\n        if A == 0: return 0\\n        if A == -2147483648 and B == -1: return 2147483647\\n        ans = math.floor(math.exp(math.log(abs(A)) - math.log(abs(B))))\\n        return ans if (A > 0) == (B > 0) else -ans\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Java Code w/ Bit Manipulation:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **1ms / 35.8MB** (beats 100% / 97%).\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int divide(int A, int B) {\\n        if (A == -2147483648 && B == -1) return 2147483647;\\n        int ans = 0, sign = A > 0 == B > 0 ? 1 : -1;\\n        if (A < 0) A = -A;\\n        if (B < 0) B = -B;\\n        if (A == B) return sign;\\n        for (int i = 0, val = B; A - B >= 0; i = 0, val = B) {\\n            while (val > 0 && A - val >= 0) val = B << ++i;\\n            A -= B << i - 1;\\n            ans += 1 << i - 1;\\n        }\\n        return sign < 0 ? -ans : ans;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Java Code w/ Logarithms:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **1ms / 35.9MB** (beats 100% / 84%).\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int divide(int A, int B) {\\n        int ans = 0;\\n        if (B == -2147483648) return A == B ? 1 : 0;\\n        if (A == -2147483648) {\\n            if (B == 1) return -2147483648;\\n            if (B == -1) return 2147483647;\\n            A += Math.abs(B);\\n            ans++;\\n        }\\n        ans += Math.floor(Math.exp(Math.log(Math.abs(A)) - Math.log(Math.abs(B))));\\n        return A > 0 == B > 0 ? ans : -ans;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***C++ Code w/ Bit Manipulation:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 5.8MB** (beats 100% / 97%).\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int divide(int A, int B) {\\n        int ans = 0, sign = A > 0 == B > 0 ? 1 : -1;\\n        if (B == -2147483648) return A == B;\\n        if (A == -2147483648)\\n            if (B == 1) return -2147483648;\\n            else if (B == -1) return 2147483647;\\n            else A += abs(B), ans++;\\n        A = abs(A), B = abs(B);\\n        for (int i = 0; A >= B; i = 0) {\\n            while (A >> i >= B) i++;\\n            A -= B << i - 1, ans += 1 << i - 1;\\n        }\\n        return sign < 0 ? -ans : ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***C++ Code w/ Logarithms:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 6.1MB** (beats 100% / 48%).\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int divide(int A, int B) {\\n        int ans = 0;\\n        if (B == -2147483648) return A == B;\\n        if (A == -2147483648)\\n            if (B == 1) return -2147483648;\\n            else if (B == -1) return 2147483647;\\n            else A += abs(B), ans++;\\n        ans += floor(exp(log(abs(A)) - log(abs(B))));\\n        return A > 0 == B > 0 ? ans : -ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

The number of such subtractions is exactly the quotient, `x / y`, and the remainder is the term that\\'s less than `y` the complexity of brute-force approach is very high.\\nFor Example- when x = 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 and `y = 1`, then it will take 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 iterations.\\n\\nTime complexity: `O(x) ` - where `x` is the `dividend`.\\nSpace complexity: `O(1)`\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution\\n{\\n    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor)\\n\\t{\\n        if(dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE && divisor == -1)\\n            return Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n        \\n\\t\\tint sign = (dividend < 0) ^ (divisor < 0) ? -1 : 1;\\n        int result = 0;\\n\\t\\tlong x = Math.abs((long)dividend);\\n        long y = Math.abs((long)divisor);\\n        \\n\\t\\twhile(x >= y)\\n\\t\\t{\\n            x -= y;\\n            result++;\\n        }\\n        return result * sign;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Solution 2:**\\n\\n- A **better approach** is to try and get more work done in each iteration. The idea is to compute the largest `k` such that 2<sup>k</sup>y <= x, then subtract 2<sup>k</sup>y from `x` and 2<sup>k</sup> to the `quotient`.\\nFor Example- if x = (1011)<sub>2</sub> and y = (10)<sub>2</sub>, then `k = 2`, since 2 * 2<sup>2</sup> <= 11 and 2 * 2<sup>3</sup> > 11. We subtract (1000)<sub>2</sub> from (1011)<sub>2</sub> to get (11)<sub>2</sub>, add 2<sup>k</sup> = 2<sup>2</sup> = (100)<sub>2</sub> to the `quotient`, and continue by updating `x` to (11)<sub>2</sub>.\\n- The advantage of using 2<sup>k</sup>y is that it can be computed very efficiently using shifting, and `x` is halved in each iteration. If it takes `n` bits to represent `x / y`, there are `O(n)` iterations. If the largest `k` such that 2<sup>k</sup>y <= x is computed by iterating through `k`, and since each iteration has time complexity `O(n)`, this leads to O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm.\\n\\nTime complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>) - where `n` is the number of bits required to represent `x / y`\\nSpace complexity: `O(1)`\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution\\n{\\n    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor)\\n\\t{\\n        if(dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE && divisor == -1)\\n            return Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n        \\n\\t\\tint sign = (dividend < 0) ^ (divisor < 0) ? -1 : 1;\\n        int result = 0;\\n\\t\\tlong x = Math.abs((long)dividend);\\n        long y = Math.abs((long)divisor);\\n        \\n\\t\\twhile(x >= y)\\n\\t\\t{\\n            int shift = 1;\\n\\n            while(x >= (y << shift))\\n\\t\\t\\t{\\n                shift++;\\n            }\\n            x -= y << (shift - 1);\\n            result += 1 << (shift - 1);\\n        }\\n        return result * sign;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Solution 3:**\\n\\n- The **best way** to find the largest `k` in each iteration is to recongnize that it keeps decreasing. Therefore, instead of testing in each iteration whether 2<sup>0</sup>y, 2<sup>1</sup>y, 2<sup>2</sup>y . . . is less than or equal to `x`, after we initially find the largest `k` such that 2<sup>k</sup>y <= x, in susequent iterations we test 2<sup>k-1</sup>y, 2<sup>k-2</sup>y, 2<sup>k-3</sup>y, . . . with `x`.\\n- For the example given earliar, after setting the `quotient`, to (100)<sub>2</sub> we continue with (11)<sub>2</sub>. Now the largest `k` such that 2<sup>k</sup>y <= (11)<sub>2</sub> is `0`, so we add 2<sup>0</sup> = (1)<sub>2</sub> to the `quotient`, which is now (101)<sub>2</sub>. We continue with (11)<sub>2</sub> - (10)<sub>2</sub> = (1)<sub>2</sub>. Since (1)<sub>2</sub> < y, we are done. So the `quotient` is (101)<sub>2</sub> and the `remainder` is (1)<sub>2</sub>.\\n\\nTime complexity: `O(n)` - where `n` is the number of bits required to represent `x / y`\\nSpace complexity: `O(1)`\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution\\n{\\n    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor)\\n\\t{\\n        if(dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE && divisor == -1)\\n            return Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n        \\n\\t\\tint sign = (dividend < 0) ^ (divisor < 0) ? -1 : 1;\\n        int result = 0;\\n        int power = 32;\\n        long x = Math.abs((long)dividend);\\n        long y = Math.abs((long)divisor);\\n        \\n       while(x >= y)\\n\\t\\t{\\n            while((y << power) > x)\\n\\t\\t\\t{\\n                power--;\\n            }\\n            x -= y << power;\\n            result += 1 << power;\\n        }\\n        return result * sign;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Then we can perform division using binary search.\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n- Handle division by zero: If the divisor is 0, return `2**31 - 1`.\\n\\n- Handle overflow case: If the dividend is `-2**31` and divisor is `-1`, return `2**31 - 1`.\\n\\n- Get the sign of the result: If both dividend and divisor are negative or positive, the sign of the result will be positive. If either dividend or divisor is negative, the sign of the result will be negative.\\n\\n- Find the largest multiple of the divisor that is less than or equal to the dividend using bit manipulation. We can do this by left-shifting the divisor and multiple by 1 until the left-shifted divisor is greater than the dividend.\\n\\n- Perform division using binary search. We can do this by right-shifting the divisor and multiple by 1 until multiple is 0. If the dividend is greater than or equal to the divisor, subtract the divisor from the dividend and add the multiple to the quotient. Repeat until multiple is 0.\\n\\n- Apply the sign to the quotient and return it.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: The time complexity of this solution is $$O(log(dividend))$$.\\n\\nFinding the largest multiple of the divisor that is less than or equal to the dividend takes `log(dividend)` iterations. Performing division using binary search takes `log(dividend) `iterations as well.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: The space complexity of this solution is `O(1)`.\\n\\nWe only use a constant amount of extra space to store variables.\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code Explanation\\n\\nThe code is an implementation of the binary division algorithm. The algorithm is used to divide two integers (dividend and divisor) and return the quotient (integer division result). Here is how the code works:\\n\\n- The function accepts two integer parameters, dividend and divisor, and returns an integer (quotient).\\n- The function first checks if the divisor is zero. If it is, it returns the maximum 32-bit integer value (2^31 - 1). This is because dividing by zero is not possible, and we need to handle this edge case.\\n- The function then checks for an overflow case where the dividend is the minimum 32-bit integer value (-2^31) and the divisor is -1. In this case, the quotient is the maximum 32-bit integer value (2^31 - 1) since dividing the minimum value by -1 would result in an overflow error.\\n- The function determines the sign of the result by checking the signs of the dividend and divisor. If both are negative or both are positive, the sign is positive. Otherwise, the sign is negative, and we make both values positive for the next step.\\n- The function then finds the largest multiple of the divisor that is less than or equal to the dividend. It does this by left-shifting the divisor and multiple variables (initially set to 1) until the shifted divisor is greater than the dividend. At this point, the last multiple that was less than or equal to the dividend is the largest multiple we need to find. The function keeps track of this multiple value and the divisor value for the next step.\\n- The function then performs the division using binary search. It does this by right-shifting the divisor and multiple variables until multiple is zero. At each step, it checks if the dividend is greater than or equal to the divisor. If it is, it subtracts the divisor from the dividend, adds the multiple to the quotient, and continues the loop. Otherwise, it right-shifts the divisor and multiple variables to check for the next value. At the end of this step, the quotient variable contains the integer division result.\\n- Finally, the function applies the sign to the result and returns it.\\n\\n\\nOverall, the binary division algorithm is an efficient way to perform integer division using bit manipulation. The code handles edge cases such as division by zero and overflow and returns the correct result with the correct sign.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def divide(self, dividend: int, divisor: int) -> int:\\n        # Handle division by zero\\n        if divisor == 0:\\n            return 2**31 - 1\\n        \\n        # Handle overflow case\\n        if dividend == -2**31 and divisor == -1:\\n            return 2**31 - 1\\n        \\n        # Get the sign of the result\\n        sign = 1\\n        if dividend < 0:\\n            dividend = -dividend\\n            sign = -sign\\n        if divisor < 0:\\n            divisor = -divisor\\n            sign = -sign\\n        \\n        # Find the largest multiple of the divisor that is less than or equal to the dividend\\n        multiple = 1\\n        while dividend >= (divisor << 1):\\n            divisor <<= 1\\n            multiple <<= 1\\n        \\n        # Perform division using binary search\\n        quotient = 0\\n        while multiple > 0:\\n            if dividend >= divisor:\\n                dividend -= divisor\\n                quotient += multiple\\n            divisor >>= 1\\n            multiple >>= 1\\n        \\n        # Apply the sign to the result\\n        return sign * quotient\\n\\n```",

This is because of handling the case of **integer overflow**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**EXAMPLE**\\nConsider the **input** as `dividend = 10` and `divisor = 3`,\\n**(1)** Now, first we find the **lowest number** (formed by dividing the `dividend` by 2) that is **greater** than the `divisor` in a loop. Initially `curr_dvd = dividend = 10` and multiplier(`t`) is `1`. The loop will continue only if `curr_dvd >= divisor`. Here, we are trying to find the multiplier by right shifting the `dividend`  by 2 (dividing by 2) in each iteration, this makes the *worst-case time complexity* of finding it `O(logn)`.\\n- **First Iteration** : 10/2 = 5, Since `5>=3(divisor)`, so `curr_dvd=5`, so our multiplier(`t`) becomes `t = t*2 = 2`.\\n- **Second Iteration** : 5/2 = 2, Since `2<3(divisor)`, so after this we will stop.\\n\\nNow, subtract `divisor * multiplier` from `dividend`, that is 10 - 3`*`**2** = 4.\\nAfter that add the multiplier to answer that is `ans+=2`\\n\\n**(2)** From the output of the previous step, since `4>=3(divisor)` repeat **(1)** on 4,\\n- **First Iteration** : 4/2 = 2, Since `2<3(divisor)`, so we will stop.\\n\\nAgain, do the same thing as **(1)**, 4 - 3`*`**1** = 1, so `ans+=1`. (As by default our *multiplier* is `1`)\\n\\n**(3)** From the output of the previous step, `1<3(divisor)`, so we will not repeat **(1)**.\\n\\nHence, the final answer is **`ans = 2 (from 1) + 1 (from 2) = 3`**.\\n\\n***Note**: The code is more optimized than explained in the above example.

                "content": "Ayo! Another question that\\'s a bit tricky to get because, you guessed it, it involves a trick lol.\\nDon\\'t worry though, here\\'s the explanation, as simple as it can get!\\n\\nWe will follow a simple rule here.\\n- We are given 2 things. Dividend and Divisor.\\n- The dividend is divided by the divisor.\\n- Our job is to multiply divisor as long as it\\'s less than dividend.\\n\\n**Take this example: Dividend = 10. Divisor = 3.**\\nWe know the answer should be 3 because 3x3=9. Which is the greatest number we can achieve, by multiplying 3 n times and when subtracted from dividend, will be as close to 0 as possible. So, 10-9=1, which is very close to 0. \\n\\nOur job is to multiply divisor again and again, to make it such a large number that when subtracted from dividend, will give us a number as close to 0 as possible.\\n\\n**Steps Taken:**\\n1. The dividend and divisor can be negative. So store their sign for later use and for now, convert them into positive integers by using the abs() function.\\n2. While dividend is greater than divisor, we do the following operations on divisor:\\n3. We take a copy of divisor and try to double it as long as it\\'s smaller than dividend.\\n4. The number of times we double, is twice the number of times we multiply. So, if we double once, we are just multiplying the number by 2^1 in reality. If we double 4 times, then we\\'re actually multiplying the number by 2^4=8 (basic math: we\\'re just multiplying the number by 2 every time).\\n5. So keep doubling divisor\\'s copy and keep tracking how many times we multiplied divisor\\'s copy.\\n6. Now after a while, the divisor\\'s copy\\'s double will be greater than the dividend. So stop the doubling loop for now.\\n7. Now, whatever we have from doubling divisor\\'s copy. Subtract that from the dividend and store that back into the dividend. So, if we doubled 5 thrice, the divisor\\'s copy will be 40 or in other words, we multiplied 5 by 2^3=8 (5 doubled=10 doubled=20 doubled=40). So if we doubled 3 times, we basically multiplied 5 by 2^3=8. So if the divisor\\'s copy is now 40 and if our dividend was 48, our dividend after subtraction will be: 48-40=8, which is still less than original divisor 5. So our loop will run once again. This time, dividend is 8. Divisor is 5. Divisor\\'s copy\\'s double is 10, which is greater than 8. So we won\\'t double the divisor this time. So, if we didn\\'t double it, we just multiplied the 5 with 1, instead of 2. Now again, subtract 8-5=3. So, we first multiplied 5 by 8, then multiplied 5 by 1. Overall, we multiplied 5 by 9 (8+1), which is our answer. More loops won\\'t work because dividend is now 3, which is less than 5.\\n8. If our original dividend and divisor would have given positive result, we return ans as is.\\n9. Otherwise, if one of the numbers was negative, then we return ans with negative sign.\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int divide(int divd, int divs) {\\n        // When given dividend is -INFINITY and divisor is -1.

We now try to subtract more by shifting 3 to the left by 1 bit (6). Since 15 - 6 > 0, shift 6 again to 12. Now 15 - 12 > 0, shift 12 again to 24, which is larger than 15. So we can at most subtract 12 from 15. Since 12 is obtained by shifting 3 to left twice, it is 1 << 2 = 4 times of 3. We add 4 to an answer variable (initialized to be 0). The above process is like 15 = 3 * 4 + 3. We now get part of the quotient (4), with a remaining dividend 3.\\n\\nThen we repeat the above process by subtracting divisor = 3 from the remaining dividend = 3 and obtain 0. We are done. In this case, no shift happens. We simply add 1 << 0 = 1 to the answer variable.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n        if (dividend == INT_MIN && divisor == -1) {\\n            return INT_MAX;\\n        }\\n        long dvd = labs(dividend), dvs = labs(divisor), ans = 0;\\n        int sign = dividend > 0 ^ divisor > 0 ? -1 : 1;\\n        while (dvd >= dvs) {\\n            long temp = dvs, m = 1;\\n            while (temp << 1 <= dvd) {\\n                temp <<= 1;\\n                m <<= 1;\\n            }\\n            dvd -= temp;\\n            ans += m;\\n        }\\n        return sign * ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nsolution 2:\\nBasic idea: a/b = e^(ln(a))/e^(ln(b)) = e^(ln(a)-ln(b))\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n        if (dividend==0) return 0;\\n        if (divisor==0) return INT_MAX;\\n        long long res=double(exp(log(fabs(dividend))-log(fabs(divisor))));\\n        if ((dividend<0)^(divisor<0)) res=-res;\\n        if (res>INT_MAX) res=INT_MAX;\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nsolution 3:\\nLong division in binary:\\nThe outer loop reduces n by at least half each iteration.

I am open to questions, comments, concerns and improvements. \\n\\n*Note:* This problem and its solution are somewhat peculiar in that they\\'re less about practicing your algorithms than coming up with an interesting approach to a dull problem using what tools you have.\\n\\n### Approach \\n\\nSo you can\\'t (or at least the problem description tells you not to) use any math operations that would seem useful in this situation... thats a shame. \\n\\n#### Brute-force\\n\\nFrom a brute-force perspective, we can make a loop where we increment some counter by one and increment value $d$ by divisor until $d > $ dividend; then the answer we are looking for is simply the value of counter right before  $d > $ dividend. However, the runtime for this approach is linear, and so the solution won\\'t submit be accepted with a `Time Limit Exceeded` message.\\n\\nBut wait... if we can\\'t use multiplication or division to solve this problem, how can we achieve better than linear runtime (linear in the size of divisor that is)?\\n\\n#### The trick\\n\\nTurns out you can actually use integer multiplication and division ... as long as you realize that [bitwise shifting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3312853/how-does-bitshifting-work-in-java]) by 1 left or right is identically integer multiplication or division by 2 respectively and consequently accept that bitwise shifting is indeed allowed as part of the solution\\n\\n*Note:* I actually kind of just lied; bitwise operations only behave as I just described for `int` values $\\\\geq 0$, so well work around this by making both the dividend and that divisor positive and applying the proper sign at the end.\\n\\nNow, there are a couple of different directions we can go once we embrace the power of division by two. The solution I\\'ve chosen to role with here is simply long division... you know the long division that you learned in elementary school but don\\'t remember any more... just done in base two. Apparently this has a name, and it\\'s called binary division. If you can\\'t be bothered to remember/figure out exactly how it works, which is totally fair IMO, then the pseudo code is illustrated reasonably clearly [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm#Integer_division_(unsigned)_with_remainder).\\n\\n### Why couldn\\'t they have restrained the dividend range by one more?\\n\\nI don\\'t want to spend a lot of time here, but there are some annoying and subtle problems that come with allowing the dividend to be `Int.MIN_VALUE` for example:\\n\\n``` java\\n    Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) = Integer.MIN_VALUE\\n```\\n\\nThus you need to be really careful dealing with this edge case, and I jerry-rigged my code so that I dealt with the consequences as I found them. It would have been so much nicer if LeetCode had just instead had the minimum allowed value be `Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1`\\n\\n### Runtime\\n\\nIts $O(log_2N)$ where $N$ is the size of the dividend: There only as many iterations as the number of bits in $N$. Note that in practice, we are restricting the inputs ot type `int`, which means that there is a maximum size of $N$, so in that sense the runtime is actually constant. I\\'m tired so someone else can come up with a better way to say this.\\n\\n### Ramblings\\n\\n- If you squint at the solution, you might be able to argue that binary long division is essentially\"binary-searching\" for the answer... but I think that\\'s a stretch.\\n\\n- Again, feel free to yell at me about the ways the code could be clearer... Looking back over it, it definitely doesn\\'t read easy.\\n\\n### Code\\n\\n``` java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n        \\n        //Edge cases:\\n        // min integer value breaks things...\\n        boolean minValFlag = false;\\n        if(dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {\\n            if(divisor == -1) return Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n            else if(divisor == 1) return Integer.MIN_VALUE;\\n            // do the first iteration of binary division manually below\\n            else minValFlag = true;\\n        }\\n        if(divisor == Integer.MIN_VALUE) return minValFlag ? 1 : 0;\\n        \\n        //Determine the sign of the result (we know at this point neither is 0)\\n        boolean isNegative = dividend < 0 ^ divisor < 0;\\n        \\n        //make both dividend and divisor positive\\n        dividend = Math.abs(dividend);\\n        divisor = Math.abs(divisor);\\n        \\n        //find the number of significant bits in the dividend\\n        int n = 1, dvdn = 1;\\n        while(dvdn < dividend && dvdn != Integer.MIN_VALUE) {\\n            dvdn <<=1;\\n            n++;\\n        }\\n        \\n        //Approach: do long division in binary\\n        int quotient = 0, remainder = 0;\\n        \\n        //deal with min-value annoyance\\n        if(minValFlag) {\\n            n = 31;\\n            remainder = 1;\\n        }\\n        \\n        for(n-- ; n >= 0; n--) {\\n            remainder <<= 1;\\n            remainder += (dividend >> n ) & 1;\\n            if(remainder >= divisor || remainder == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {\\n                remainder -= divisor;\\n                quotient += 1 << n;\\n            }\\n            //System.out.println(String.format(\"n is: %d %nremainder is: %d %nquotient is: %d %n\",n,remainder,quotient));\\n        }\\n        \\n        //return statement\\n        return isNegative ? 0 - quotient : quotient;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

The number of times we subtract will be our quotient and what\\'s left in dividend will be the remainder.\\n\\nExample: if dividend = 33 and divisor = 6, then we do\\n33 - 6 = 27\\n27 - 6 = 21\\n21 - 6 = 15\\n15 - 6 = 9\\n9 - 6 = 3\\nnow 3<6 , so we stop here and hence our remainder is 3 and no, of times we subtracted is 5 = quotient.\\n\\nFor this approach,\\n\\n```\\nint divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n \\n // if any one of them is negative then quotient will be negative else positive\\n  int sign = ((dividend < 0) ^ (divisor < 0)) ? -1 : 1; \\n \\n  // Update both divisor and\\n  // dividend positive\\n  dividend = abs(dividend);\\n  divisor = abs(divisor);\\n \\n  // Initialize the quotient\\n  int quotient = 0;\\n  while (dividend >= divisor) {\\n    dividend -= divisor;\\n    ++quotient;\\n  }\\n  //if the sign value computed earlier is -1 then negate the value of quotient\\n  if(sign==-1) quotient=-quotient;\\n   \\n  return quotient;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Time Complexity** : O(dividend) [consider case when dividend=n and divisor=1]\\n\\nNow we\\'ll try to optimize this time complexity.\\n\\n# Approach 2\\n\\nThe second approach includes **BIT MANIPULATION**.\\n\\nconsider the same example as above , dividend=33 and divisor=6\\n\\nhere we try to increase our divisor until it attains maximum value less than or equal to dividend, i.e.\\n\\n6 < 33\\n6 + 6 = 12 < 33\\n6 + 6 + 6 = 18 < 33\\n6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24 < 33\\n6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 30 < 33\\n6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 36 > 33 -----------------> stop here\\n\\nthus, max value of divisor can be 30 which is 5 times 6, hence quotient is 5.\\nnow instead of repeatedly adding this (which is same as in case of previous approach), we\\'ll use bit manipulation to do it more efficiently.\\n\\nwe iterate from i= 31 to 0 and try to find (divisor * (2^i)) if it is less than our dividend, we store it in a var, update our quotient and do the same. like in this example where dividend = 33 and divisor = 6\\n\\nintial t=0 (here we\\'ll be storing the current updated divisor), q=0 (quotient)\\nwe\\'ll be checking if t + (divisor * (2^i) <= dividend, if it is true we\\'ll do \\nt = t + (divisor * (2^i)) and q = q + (2^i)\\n\\ni = 31 : 0 + (6 * 2^31) > 33\\ni = 30 : 0 + (6 * 2^30) > 33\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n...\\ni = 3 : 0 + (6 * 2^3) = (6 * 8) = 48 > 33\\ni = 2 : 0 + (6 * 2^2) = (6 * 4) = **24 < 33** => t= 0 + 24 = 24  and  q = 0 + (2^2) = 4\\ni = 1 : 24 + (6 * 2^1) = 24 + 12 = 36 > 33\\ni = 0 : 24 + (6 * 2^0) = 24 + 6 = **30 < 33** => t = 24 + 6 = 30  and q = 4 + (2^0) = 5 \\n\\nnow we\\'ll put appropriate sign in front of q (if any one of divisor or dividend negative the negative else positive), then if q lies in range of int ,we return q else we return INT_MAX.\\n\\n**BIT Manipulation PART :**\\nsince , we aren\\'t allowed to use multiplication operator , thus we can calculate\\n\\ndivisor * (2^i)  as (divisor<<i) as left shift by i means same as multiplyin the number by (2^i)\\n\\n**CODE :**\\n\\n```\\nint divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n        \\n        long long t=0, q=0, n=labs(dividend), m=labs(divisor);\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t//here we find the sign of the quotient, if both dividend and divisor\\n\\t\\t//have same sign then sign will be +1 else -1\\n        int sign = (dividend<0) ^ (divisor<0) ? -1 : 1;\\n        \\n        for(long long i=31;i>=0;i--)\\n        {\\n\\t\\t\\t//(m<<i) = m * (2^i)\\n            if(t + (m<<i) <= n)\\n            {\\n                t += (m<<i);\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t//since 2^i here can be large for int so we typecast it in long long to prevent overflow \\n                q += (1LL<<i);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        if(sign<0) q=-q;\\n        \\n\\t\\t//if q goes out of bound, we return INT_MAX.\\n        return ((q>INT_MAX) or (q<INT_MIN)) ?

                "content": "If you are furiously looking for answers as i was, let me shed some light. I had to spend a lots of time to understand the secret behind the solutions to this problem. \\n\\nFirst of all, As we all know already the basic idea for solving the problem with out the mod operator is simply **identifying the number of times the divisor can fully SUBSTRACT the dividend as a whole** but iterations are so costly and it will not work for large numbers. The obvious secret is to identify **effective way to reduce the number of substractions**\\n\\nThe following is simply my idea but there can be many as well, \\n\\n**1. Exponensly increase the divisor until before it surpass the dividend then substract with it.\\n2. Add up the divisor until reduced\\n3. Repeat the same until it brings to 0**\\n\\nFor an example, 116 divided by 3, Following is the way to gradually reduce the possibilities and idendify the final quotient\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/31c9c3ac-8bd5-437a-a976-ad74d369e0f0_1624215160.6451015.png)\\n\\nLets start with 3, then double it which is 6 then 12, 24,..until we stop at 96 because 192 can be substracted. So here 96 == 3 * 2^5 ==  3 << 5 and quotient = 32, remainder = 20\\n\\nLet start the same process again with 20, it can go upto which gets to 12 == 3 * 2^2 == 3 << 2 then the quotient is now 32 + 4 = 36, reminder = 8\\n\\nLets start over again, i can go upto 6 which is again 6 == 3 * 2^1 == 3 << 1 the quotient is not 36+2 = 38, remainder = 2 which is less than divisor so we can not continue with the cycle and all ends here.\\n\\nHowever multiplication is not allowed to use let see what else we can do for replacing it. \\n\\n**Programmatic Rule:**\\nLeft Shift (<<) shall be considered as multiplication by 2^N\\nSimilarly, Right Shift (>>) shall be considered as division by 2^N \\n\\nSince the environment only allows to accomodate `integer`  data type, overflow cases are the corner cases.\\n\\nLets dive into the code,\\n\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n     public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n        if (dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE && divisor == -1) return Integer.MAX_VALUE; //Cornor case when -2^31 is divided by -1 will give 2^31 which doesnt exist so overflow \\n         \\n        boolean negative = dividend < 0 ^ divisor < 0; //Logical XOR will help in deciding if the results is negative only if any one of them is negative\\n        \\n        dividend = Math.abs(dividend);\\n        divisor = Math.abs(divisor);\\n        int quotient = 0, subQuot = 0;\\n        \\n        while (dividend - divisor >= 0) {\\n            for (subQuot = 0; dividend - (divisor << subQuot << 1) >= 0; subQuot++);\\n            quotient += 1 << subQuot; //Add to the quotient\\n            dividend -= divisor << subQuot; //Substract from dividend to start over with the remaining\\n        }\\n        return negative ? -quotient : quotient;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n",

And making this large divisor can be done by bitwise left-shift.\\n\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n\\t\\n\\t    // If dividend is zero, return zero directly.\\n        if (dividend == 0) {\\n            return 0;\\n        }\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t// To let our strategy to work, we should handle the case if divisor is INT_MIN.\\n        if (divisor == INT_MIN) {\\n            return dividend == INT_MIN ? 1 : 0;\\n        }\\n        \\n\\t\\t// Use exclusive or to check the sign of answer.\\n        bool is_pos = (dividend > 0) ^ (divisor < 0);\\n        int ans = 0;\\n        \\n\\t\\t// Here is different from the description above.\\n\\t\\t// In practice, we force our dividend to be negative.\\n\\t\\t// Because the range of negative values (2^31) is larger than the range of positive values (2^31 - 1).\\n\\t\\t// If we force dividend to be positive, there may be integer overflow.\\n        if (dividend > 0) {\\n            dividend = 0 - dividend;\\n        }\\n        \\n\\t\\t// Divisor should be positive.\\n\\t\\t// Because we will apply bitwise shift to it.\\n\\t\\t// And we have handled the case when divisor is INT_MIN.\\n        if (divisor < 0) {\\n            divisor = 0 - divisor;\\n        }\\n        \\n\\t\\t// To compare negative dividend and positive divisor, we need to add negative sign to divisor.\\n        while (dividend <= -divisor) {\\n            int tmp = divisor;\\n            int step = 1;\\n            \\n\\t\\t\\t// \"tmp < 0x40000000\" is a trick. 0x40000000 is 2^30.\\n\\t\\t\\t// If we don\\'t limit the upper bound, tmp may keep shifting and lead an integer overflow.\\n            while (tmp < 0x40000000 && -tmp > dividend) {\\n                tmp <<= 1;\\n                step <<= 1;\\n            }\\n            \\n\\t\\t\\t// Here we find the largest divisor.\\n            if (-tmp < dividend) {\\n                tmp >>= 1;\\n                step >>= 1;\\n            }\\n            \\n            dividend += tmp;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t// Another trick is that using minus instead of using add.\\n\\t\\t\\t// The same reason as above: the range of negative values is larger than the range of positive values.\\n            ans -= step;\\n        }\\n        \\n        if (!is_pos) {\\n            return ans;\\n        } else {\\n            return ans == INT_MIN ?

                "content": "At this point I'm sure most solutions are well understood. Without simply posting yet another ever so slightly different solution, I want to discuss a few points where some have discussed in comments, but may not be easily found; as well as giving those who don't have as many real interview experiences some ideas about what companies may prefer. \n\nFirst of all, this question is all about the limitation and constraints. For these type of questions, there may be cheesy ways to make it easier, but in a real interview, you shouldn't bank on it being allowed. For this very question it is specified the system can only handle Integers, thus **using Long should be out of the question.** If it's not clearly stated, you can always ask, just don't assume. We see it ain't too hard without long by turning numbers negative as many solutions have.\n\nSecondly, a straight forward adding solution may return wrong answers due to overflow during adding. A better way would be to use bit shifting, but unless you started interview solution on this direction initially (which can be weird tbh unless you do bits a lot), **it is easy to add a condition check to make sure that new sum isn't overflowing by seeing if it switched signs**. Though I find this slightly hacky from coding perspective because the purpose isn't obvious from code.\n\nIt is a good chance to discuss with interviewer what's preferred. For example, another cheap way is to define a value that's half of Max or Min (for using negatives), and use that as a loop guard to be more explicit. The constraint of not allowing multiplication and division is obviously for avoiding direct solutions, but we should always be able to hardcode a value if necessary. \n\nThough for this question, **some interviewer may be looking specifically for bit shifting operations** cuz it can be better or \"leet\", in which case communication is the most important to find out. I'd argue for code readability above all else.\n\nLast but not least, when discussing edge cases, it's important to not blast thru it without thought. For things like dividing by 0, if it wasn't explicitely stated to be impossible by the question, **It should be handled as an Exception**. Same for MIN_VALUE divide by -1 as well. \n\nPeople never throw catch exceptions on Leetcode but it's a great talking point in interviews. They may follow up and say for now assume it won't happen, or return a specific value to represent error for simplicity. If the interviewer said that, it's fine, but you should never come up with that yourself, that's bad code, confusing and can be factually incorrect. Of course, Leetcode make these explicit so people don't rage over unclear requirements, but it's good to think about. If an exception is to be thrown, it's also good to discuss with interviewer about whose responsibility it should be for handling it. This method, or the caller. \n\nI will attach my solution for reference, but nothing special. Recursive, no long or bit shifting though. \n\n```\n    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\n        // Handle edge cases\n        if (dividend == 0) {\n            return 0;\n        } else if (dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE && divisor == -1) {\n            return Integer.MAX_VALUE; \n        } \n        \n        // Get sign and switch to negative\n        boolean positive = true; \n        if (dividend > 0) {\n            dividend = -dividend;\n            positive = !positive;\n        }\n        \n        if (divisor > 0) {\n            divisor = -divisor;\n            positive = !positive;\n        }\n        \n        int res = helper(dividend, divisor);\n        return positive ? res : -res;\n    }\n    \n    public int helper(int dividend, int divisor) {\n        if (dividend > divisor) {\n            return 0;\n        } \n        \n        int multiple = divisor;\n        int count = 1;\n        while (multiple + multiple > dividend && multiple + multiple < 0) {\n            count += count;\n            multiple += multiple; \n        }\n        \n        int leftOver = dividend - multiple; \n        \n        int res = count + helper(leftOver, divisor);\n        \n        return res;\n    }\n```\n\nAnd a quick reminder on throwing exceptions - if others should handle it, simply modify method signature to be \n```\n    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) throws Exception {\n        if (divisor == 0) {\n            throw new Exception(\"plz no\"); // Can make or use a more meaningful Exception class \n        } \n        ...\n```\n\nIf you were to handle it yourself, but have to return a value for the time. Then it's pointless unless printing a message or calling a log would suffice \n```\n    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\n        try {\n            ...\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage()); // or call some log / method to make this meaningful\n            return Integer.MAX_VALUE; // or w.e defined value to resolve this so caller can move on\n        } \n```\n\nI know this isn't the standard solution for leetcode discussion.

The main algorithm involves repeated subtractions of B from A to calculate the quotient, accounting for signs and avoiding integer overflow. The dividend A is taken to be non-postive for the reason when A=INT_MIN, the number -INT_MAX=2^31 is not  32-bit unsigned int.\\n\\nThe implementation for integer division utilizes bit manipulation techniques. It handles edge cases and performs division using bit shifts, which is more efficient than repeated subtractions.

Basically you should be comfortable with converting a positive numbers by hand and the basics of negative numbers in binary to understand how we can use bit manipulation to solve this problem \\n\\nWe use that logic to count the number of times our divisor fits into the dividend and since we\\'re shifting the bits to get our answer the time complexity will be O(log(n))\\n\\nBasically here initially we set our count to 1 if the dividend is greater than or equal to the divisor. We check to see if we can shift the bit over by checking to see if the number will still be greater than our dividend. If it is than we shift the bits of the count, dividend and divisor. Probably best to write it down to see how the shifts are shifting to understand how we\\'re using the power of 2 to get our result. We handle negatives by converting the input to a positive number and than adding the sign at the end.\\n```\\n/**\\n * bit manipulation\\n * space O(1) \\n * time O(log n) we\\'re shifting the n bits\\n */\\n var divide = function(n, d) {\\n    if (n === 0 || d === 0) return 0\\n    let isNegative = false;\\n    let result = 0;\\n    if ((d < 0 || n < 0) && !(d < 0 && n < 0)) isNegative = true;\\n    n = Math.abs(n)\\n    d = Math.abs(d)\\n\\n    while (n >= d) {\\n        let count = 1, temp = n, tempd = d\\n        while (tempd <= (temp >> 1)){\\n            count <<= 1\\n            temp >>= 1\\n            tempd <<= 1\\n        }\\n        result += count\\n        n -= tempd\\n    }\\n    if (isNegative) return -result\\n    if (result >= 2**31) {\\n        return 2**31 - 1\\n    }\\n    return result\\n};\\n```",

So, positional weight of each of the following bits is twice the previous bit i.e. its power is increased by 1. As a result, when we push a number towards the left by 1 bit the whole number gets multiplied by 2 power 1. Similarly when a number is pushed to the left by n bits means the number is multiplied by 2 power n.\\n\\nThus in general if you shift a number to left by n bits, it gets multiplied n times by 2.\\n\\n**Steps:**\\n1. Initially, set the quotient to 0.\\n2. Check if any one of the numbers is negative and store it in a separate variable.\\n3. Make both the numbers positive.\\n4.

Why do we make our numbers negatives, well because programming sucks and negative numbers have 1 more than positives... so that means we get integer overflow if we try and convert all the negatives to positives. This might still not make sense why we do this, I encourage you to try programming the solution and you will see why it is advantageous to have all the numbers be either positive or negative ( makes defining the actual long division algorithm much more easy ), other solutions that don\\'t do this tend to lead to worse code in my opinion that would be hard to come up with without a lot of debugging...\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\n(sum + sum) < sum\\n```\\n\\nLastly this nice little line of code actually handles all of our overflow! since we are dealing with negatives, if we add two negative numbers and get a value that isn\\'t smaller, something went wrong!\\n",

                "content": "I started to think about this problem with the same approach [I used for the power problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/discuss/739646/): considering a number (`dividend`) as a sum of another (`divisor`) multiplied by 2 and this would have allowed me to know the quotient.\\n\\nFor example, assume that `dividend` is `60` and `divisors` is `3`: I can see `60 == 12 + 48` or, in a more explicit form (with `**` implying the power operation):\\n`60 == 3 * 2 ** 4 + 3 * 2 ** 2` and again: `60 == 1 * 3 * 2 ** 4 + 0 * 3 * 2 ** 3 + 1 * 3 * 2 ** 2 + 0 * 3 * 2 ** 1 + 0 * 3 * 2 ** 0`.\\n\\nIf I extract the first multiplying factors (`1` and `0`) and align them, I would get `10100`, which is indeed the binary representation of `20`, my goal!\\n\\nNow, to generalise this approach, we first of all need a few variables:\\n* `bits` is our counter variable that we will use in a bit (no pun intended) to know how many times we need to multiply our `divisor` by `2` to get a result, with initial value of `1`  (since down below we will increase the divisor by one extra step with my approach);\\n* `res` is our usual accumulator variable and it is going to be a `long`, same as `d1` and `d2`, to avoid annoyng overflows/edge cases;\\n* `isMinus` is a boolean to remind us what the sign of the final result should be, initially set to `false`.\\n\\nWe will then proceed making sure both `d1` and `d2` have the same sign (positive, for simplicity), flipping `isMinus` if we have to flip their sign.\\n\\nNow, in order to proceed with our logic discussed above, we will need a `d2` which is just bigger than `d1` and to keep track of how many times we need to multiply it by `2` - I know you could achieve the same with logarithms, but this is cheaper since we just stop with the last integer and on top of that we are also growing `d2` just as needed.\\n\\nAnd since after the previous loop we are going to know how many bits will make our result, time to go for a main loop `bits` time and:\\n* set `res` to double its previous value, plus `1` if `d1 >= d2` (meaning we can subtract it and it will make a bit in our final result);\\n* if the above condition is `true`, we will also have to decrease `d1` accordingly, subtracting `d2` to it;\\n* finally, time to reduce `d2` by one bit.\\n\\nA bit of (painfully annoying) extra logic to handle the edge cases and we can finally return `res` or `-res`, depending from `isMinus` :)\\n\\nOne more time, let\\'s assume we are dividing `70` by `3`, so we will have at the beginning of the main loop:\\n\\n```cpp\\n70 // d1\\n96 // d2\\n6 // bits\\n0 // res\\n```\\n\\nFirst iteration, since `70 > 96`, we proceed changing little, other than `d2` and of course decreasing `bits`:\\n\\n```cpp\\n70 // d1\\n48 // d2\\n5 // bits\\n0 // res\\n```\\n\\nOkay, now we can subtract, so we have:\\n\\n```cpp\\n22 // d1\\n24 // d2\\n4 // bits\\n1 // res\\n```\\n\\nAgain our condition `d1 >= d2` is `false`, so we just update `d2`, `bits` and this time also `res` increases (in the first step it was the same, given its initial value of `0`):\\n\\n```cpp\\n22 // d1\\n12 // d2\\n3 // bits\\n2 // res\\n```\\n\\nSince `22 >= 12`, we proceed like this:\\n\\n```cpp\\n10 // d1\\n6 // d2\\n2 // bits\\n5 // res\\n```\\n\\nAnd again, since `10 >= 4`:\\n\\n```cpp\\n4 // d1\\n3 // d2\\n1 // bits\\n11 // res\\n```\\n\\nAnd finally, since `4 >= 3`:\\n\\n```cpp\\n1 // d1\\n1 // d2\\n0 // bits\\n23 // res\\n```\\n\\nAnd at this point we can exit with the right result (and note that `d1` would also be our remainder).\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n        // support variables\\n        int bits = 1;\\n        long d1 = dividend, d2 = divisor, res = 0;\\n        bool isMinus = false;\\n        // setting the sign\\n        if (d1 < 0) isMinus = !isMinus, d1 = -d1;\\n        if (d2 < 0) isMinus = !isMinus, d2 = -d2;\\n        // adjusting d2\\n        while (d2 <= d1) d2 <<= 1, bits++;\\n        // composing res\\n        while (bits--) {\\n            res = res * 2 + (d1 >= d2);\\n            if (d1 >= d2) d1 -= d2;\\n            d2 >>= 1;\\n        }\\n        // handling overflows\\n        if (res > 2147483647l + isMinus) res = 2147483647;\\n        return isMinus ? -res : res;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "Question tells us to assume we are using an environment that only has up to 32-bit signed integers available, so let\\'s only use `i32`s for our computation.\\nAlso, we\\'re not allowed to use the `*`, `/ ` or `%` operators, obviously.\\n\\nTo achieve logarithmic runtime, we want to split the `dividend` into components of `divisor * (2^x)`, where `x` is a natural number (possibly including 0).\\nThe result of the division will be the sum of the `2^x` terms in our split components.\\n_For example, if we wish to divide 99 by 3: `99 == 3*(2^5) + 3*(2^0)`; therefore the answer is `2^5 + 2^0 == 32 + 1 == 33`._\\n\\nThe `2^x` terms are convenient, as we can use bitwise shifts to multiply and divide the `dividend` by powers of 2, due to binary being a base-2 number system.\\nIn many cases, we won\\'t be able to split `dividend` exactly, as there\\'ll be a remainder; in those cases we\\'ll want to get as close as possible such that the sum of our components doesn\\'t surpass `dividend`.\\n\\nTo avoid issues regarding overflow, we make our `dividend` and `divisor` negative, and use the negative signed integer range for our computation.\\nThe reason for this is that the negative integer range is always 1 greater than the positive range (excluding 0), which makes overflow checking a bit nicer (also avoids the temptation of cheesing the problem using `u32`s or `i64`s or similiar, **which is _very_ naughty**).\\n\\n```\\nimpl Solution {\\n    pub fn divide(mut dividend: i32, mut divisor: i32) -> i32 {\\n        assert!(divisor != 0);\\n\\n        let is_ans_neg = (dividend < 0) ^ (divisor < 0);\\n        dividend = -dividend.abs();\\n        divisor = -divisor.abs();\\n\\n        let (mut neg_ans, mut curr_div, mut curr_mul) = (0, divisor, -1);\\n        while curr_div <= divisor {\\n            if curr_div < dividend {\\n                curr_div = if curr_div == -1 { 0 } else { curr_div >> 1 };\\n                curr_mul = if curr_mul == -1 { 0 } else { curr_mul >> 1 };\\n            } else {\\n                neg_ans += curr_mul;\\n                dividend -= curr_div;\\n                curr_div <<= 1;\\n                curr_mul <<= 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        match neg_ans {\\n            std::i32::MIN if !is_ans_neg => std::i32::MAX,\\n            _ if is_ans_neg => neg_ans,\\n            _ => -neg_ans,\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAlso, seeing that integers are stored as 2s complement, you may instead prefer to use `~variable + 1` to negate signs, rather than `-variable`. Do whatever suits you. :)\\n\\nTime complexity: `O(~log32) == O(1)` due to the constraints on the inputs.\\nExtra-space complexity: `O(1)`.",

We change both the dividend and divisor to positive and then add in the negative sign at the end if needed. But firstly, we have a few edge cases:\\n- If dividend = int_min and divisor = -1, then the actual result of the divison would be -int_min, oer +2147483648. But this overflows int_max, so we just return int_max in this case.\\n- If dividend = int_min and divisor = int_min, then return 1.\\n- Even if the above two cases do not happen, we still need to modify dividend. The reason is if dividend = int_min, then abs(dividend) would overflow int_max, so we can\\'t allow this to happen. I take care of this by simply subtracting or adding one divisor from dividend, based on the sign of divisor. If you don\\'t understand this, consider the following logic: The quotient when 10000 is divided by 3 is also equal to 1 + the quotient of 9997 / 3. We basically remove one instance of divisor from the dividend so that abs(dividend) no longer overflows. \\n- If none of the above happens (basically, if dividend != int_min), but divisor is int_min, then obviously the correct quotient is `0`.\\n\\nWithout multiplication, division, or modulo operators, the only way we can do this is through **bit shift operators**. But more specifically, this program mainly relies on the **binary right shift (>>)** operator, because this helps us avoid overflow. This loop is the main part of the program:\\n\\n```\\nint result = 0;\\nfor(int i = 31; i >= 0; --i) {\\n\\tint shifted_dividend = (dividend >> i); // = floor(dividend / 2^i)\\n\\tif(shifted_dividend >= divisor) { // then divisor * 2^i <= dividend\\n\\t\\tresult += (1 << i);\\n\\t\\tdividend -= (divisor << i);\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhat happens here is the following.\\n- Loop from the most significant bit to the least significant bit in a 32-bit number. For each bit, we determine if the final quotient (result) should have this bit set or not. How do we decide this for each position i? Just do the following:\\n- Let ```shifted_dividend = (dividend >> i)```, which is the quotient of dividend / 2^i. Basically this is just how many times 2^i can go into dividend. Now, obviously, if 2^i can go into dividend at least ```divisor``` times, then we know that ```divisor * 2^i <= dividend```, which means that we should add 2^i to the quotient, and subtract ```divisor * 2^i``` from ```dividend```!\\n- Notice how ```(dividend >> i)``` never overflows, since it must result in a number smaller than ```dividend```. Also, it never becomes negative; if `i` too large, then ```(dividend >> i)``` would just equal `0`. This fits up with the conceptual definition that this is the number of times 2^i can go into ```dividend```.\\n- Obviously, we return ```result```, and make sure to take care of whether it\\'s negative or positive.\\n\\n**Note about C++ Undefined Behavior:** Right-shifting a negative signed integer is undefined behavior, but right-shifting a positive signed integer isn\\'t. cppreference.com says that \"For unsigned a and for signed and non-negative a, the value of a >> b is the integer part of a/2^b.\" This is one of the main reasons why we choose to change both numbers to positive before finding the quotient (and only adding the negative sign at the very end).",

It has a horrible number of edge cases with integer overflow, and is definitely\\nnot of \"medium\" difficulty to anyone, but a hardware designer.\\n\\nLet\\'s see the (terrible and pointless) code I came up with that should fit the requirements:\\n```\\n// This function implements restoring division taking two 32-bit unsigned inputs\\n// and outputs a 32-bit unsigned quotient, with no overflow possible\\nunsigned udiv(unsigned dividend, unsigned divisor) {\\n    unsigned quo = 0;\\n    unsigned long rem = dividend;\\n    unsigned long div = (unsigned long) divisor << 32;\\n\\n    for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {\\n        rem <<= 1;\\n        if (rem >= div) {\\n            rem -= div;\\n            quo = quo << 1 | 1;\\n        } else {\\n            quo <<= 1;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    return quo;\\n}\\n\\n// This function does a bunch of horrific edge case checking to\\n// make sure no integer overflow is possible\\nint divide(int dividend, int divisor) {\\n    int sgn = 0;\\n\\n    unsigned u_dividend;\\n    if (dividend < 0) {\\n        u_dividend = -(long)dividend;\\n        sgn ^= 1;\\n    } else {\\n        u_dividend = dividend;\\n    }\\n    unsigned u_divisor;\\n    if (divisor < 0) {\\n        u_divisor = -(long)divisor;\\n        sgn ^= 1;\\n    } else {\\n        u_divisor = divisor;\\n    }\\n\\n    unsigned u_result = udiv(u_dividend, u_divisor);\\n\\n    if (sgn) {\\n        if (-(long) u_result < INT_MIN)\\n            return INT_MAX;\\n        return -u_result;\\n    } else {\\n        if (u_result > INT_MAX)\\n            return  INT_MAX;\\n        return u_result;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo add insult to injury, LeetCode is not able to actually measure the runtime of\\nany reasonable fast C code, so it presents mine and the two cheaters above as\\nhaving a \"0 ms\" runtime, and just as good.

It determines the sign of the quotient and converts both the dividend and divisor to positive values, pintdd.com. Then, it repeatedly subtracts the divisor from the dividend and increments the quotient until the dividend becomes smaller than the divisor. Finally, it applies the sign to the quotient and returns the result.\\n\\nIn the example usage, the code is called with dividend = 10 and divisor = 3. The result is then printed, which will be 3, representing the quotient after dividing the dividend by the divisor."

In DFS traversal -\\n* We start at the root with current number `cur = 0`. \\n* Every time, the current node\\'s digit will be appended to `cur` from root to leaf and we recurse for left and right child.\\n* If we reach a leaf node (a node not having any left or right child), we have formed the complete root-to-leaf number.

The advantage of this traversal is that we can traverse the tree in O(1) space complexity. The basic idea is to link predecessors to root nodes so we can trace it back once we have traversed a side without need of using a stack. It\\'s a bit hard to explain in words so I have attached an image of how it works below.

To do this, we can traverse the tree in a depth-first manner, keeping track of the current number formed by the path from the root to the current node. When we reach a leaf node, we add the current number to our running sum.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nWe can use a recursive approach to traverse the tree. We start with the root node and a current number of 0. At each node, we multiply the current number by 10 and add the node\\'s value to get the new current number. If the current node is a leaf node, we add the current number to our running sum. Otherwise, we recursively traverse the left and right subtrees, passing the new current number to each.\\n\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nWe visit each node exactly once, so the time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity is $$O(h)$$, where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursive calls on the function call stack. In the worst case, the tree is a skewed tree with a height of n, resulting in a space complexity of $$O(n)$$. However, in the best case, the tree is a balanced tree with a height of log n, resulting in a space complexity of O(log n).\\n\\n\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b427e686-2e5d-469a-8e7a-db5140022a6b_1677715904.0948765.png)\\n\\n\\n# Please Upvote\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\n```\\nThanks for visiting my solution.\\uD83D\\uDE0A Keep Learning\\nPlease give my solution an upvote! \\uD83D\\uDC4D\\nIt\\'s a simple way to show your appreciation and\\nkeep me motivated.

Also make a copy of this string because while applying DFS we will give a recursive call on both left child and right child, so we will require **2 copies of string** for these **2 recursive calls**.

YOU WILL DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE CODE LINE BY LINE AFTER SEEING THE APPROACH.**\\n\\n# Intuition of this Problem:\\nThe intuition behind the problem is to traverse the binary tree using a depth-first search (DFS) approach and keep track of the sum of the numbers formed so far along each path from the root to the leaf nodes.\\n\\nAs we traverse each path from the root to a leaf node, we can calculate the sum of the numbers formed by concatenating the values of each node along the path. We can then add this sum to a running total.\\n\\nOnce we have traversed all possible paths from the root to the leaf nodes, we will have accumulated the sum of all root-to-leaf paths in the binary tree. Finally, we can return this sum as the solution to the problem.\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n\\n# Approach for this Problem:\\n1. Define a helper function that takes in the current node, the total sum, and the sum till the current node.\\n2. If the current node is null, return.\\n3. Calculate the sum till the current node by multiplying the sum till the previous node by 10 and adding the value of the current node.\\n4. If the current node is a leaf node, add the sum till the current node to the total sum.\\n5. Recursively call the helper function for the left and right child of the current node with updated parameters.\\n6. Define the main function that initializes the total sum to 0 and calls the helper function with the root node and the total sum.\\n7. Return the total sum.\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Code:\\n```C++ []\\n/**\\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\\n * struct TreeNode {\\n *     int val;\\n *     TreeNode *left;\\n *     TreeNode *right;\\n *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\\n *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\\n *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}\\n * };\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void helper (TreeNode *root, int &totalSum, int sumTillCurrNode) {\\n        if (root == nullptr)\\n            return; \\n        sumTillCurrNode = sumTillCurrNode * 10 + root -> val;\\n        if (root -> left == nullptr && root -> right == nullptr)\\n            totalSum += sumTillCurrNode;\\n        helper(root -> left, totalSum, sumTillCurrNode);\\n        helper(root -> right, totalSum, sumTillCurrNode);\\n    }\\n    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {\\n        int sum = 0;\\n        helper (root, sum, 0);\\n        return sum;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\n/**\\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\\n * public class TreeNode {\\n *     int val;\\n *     TreeNode left;\\n *     TreeNode right;\\n *     TreeNode() {}\\n *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }\\n *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {\\n *         this.val = val;\\n *         this.left = left;\\n *         this.right = right;\\n *     }\\n * }\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int sumNumbers(TreeNode root) {\\n        int[] totalSum = new int[1];\\n        helper(root, totalSum, 0);\\n        return totalSum[0];\\n    }\\n\\n    private void helper(TreeNode root, int[] totalSum, int sumTillCurrNode) {\\n        if (root == null) {\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        sumTillCurrNode = sumTillCurrNode * 10 + root.val;\\n        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {\\n            totalSum[0] += sumTillCurrNode;\\n        }\\n        helper(root.left, totalSum, sumTillCurrNode);\\n        helper(root.right, totalSum, sumTillCurrNode);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n```Python []\\n# Definition for a binary tree node.\\n# class TreeNode:\\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\\n#         self.val = val\\n#         self.left = left\\n#         self.right = right\\nclass Solution:\\n    def sumNumbers(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:\\n        totalSum = [0]\\n        self.helper(root, totalSum, 0)\\n        return totalSum[0]\\n\\n    def helper(self, root: TreeNode, totalSum: List[int], sumTillCurrNode: int) -> None:\\n        if root is None:\\n            return\\n        sumTillCurrNode = sumTillCurrNode * 10 + root.val\\n        if root.left is None and root.right is None:\\n            totalSum[0] += sumTillCurrNode\\n        self.helper(root.left, totalSum, sumTillCurrNode)\\n        self.helper(root.right, totalSum, sumTillCurrNode)\\n\\n```\\n\\n# Time Complexity and Space Complexity:\\n- Time complexity: **O(n)**, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

So, we will update the value by doing: `val*10 + node.val` And pass them into both left and right children.\\n\\nIf this is a leaf node, we reached a base case.

                "content": "In the question, it is mentioned that the number is formed from digits, i.e. number present in the path from the  root-to-leaf. So order here is important. \\n\\nMoreover, it is evident, that one has to implement Depth- First Search to solve this problem, as the we have to traverse till the dept of the tree and get the digits to form the number. \\n\\n## Some Basics\\n### Forming the number from digits.\\nTo make a number from digits, one has to do the following:\\n1. The left most part of a number is multiplied by an order of 10.\\n2. The right most part is left at it is.\\n\\nUsing the above approch, one can form a number from the fdigits.\\n\\n### Finding the digits\\nNow the next task is to find the digits. Since the digits has to be found out by traversing the depth of the tree.\\n\\nBelow is the implementation of the above approach:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n   // Function to traverse the depth of trr\\n   // and find the sum\\n    int dfs(TreeNode* root,int prev){\\n        if(root == NULL){\\n            return 0;\\n        }\\n        if(root->left == root->right){\\n            return prev*10 + root->val;\\n        }\\n        \\n        return dfs(root->left,prev*10 + root->val) + dfs(root->right,prev*10 + root->val);\\n    }\\n    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {\\n        int answer = dfs(root,0);\\n        return answer;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation**\\n1. FIrst check if the current node is a valid one or not. If not, return.\\n2. Check if the current node is root, if yes then add the value at root with that of the previous sum.\\n3. Recursively call the function for the left and right sub part of the tree.\\n\\nThe `prev` is used to store the sum of the previous values. \\n\\n",

                "content": "**Explanation:**\\nBasic idea is to explore all the paths and then store the digits that you encounter on the way and then find the result. So, whenever there is an exploring all the path stuff then we should think of recursion. And, since it is a tree related question then there is a high chance of using recursion.\\n\\nNow, we will do pre-order traversal for this tree and when we hit any node we will convert that node val to string and concatenate to our string `s` and whenever we hit the leaf node we will store the string `s` in a vector name `paths`.\\n\\nBasically, `paths` is a vector which stores all the path from `root-to-leaf` in a string format.\\n\\nNow, after that we will traverse the vector and convert all the strings to digits one by one and add them and return the ans i.e. sum.\\n\\n**Code:**\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<string> paths;\\n    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {\\n        if(!root) return 0;\\n        findSumNumber(root, \"\");\\n        int sum = 0;\\n        for(auto path : paths){\\n            int n = stoi(path);\\n            sum += n;\\n        }\\n        return sum;\\n    }\\n    \\n    void findSumNumber(TreeNode* root, string s){\\n        if(!root) return;\\n        \\n        s += to_string(root->val);\\n        \\n        //if the node is a leaf node\\n        if(root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL){\\n            paths.push_back(s);\\n            s.pop_back();\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        \\n        findSumNumber(root->left, s);\\n        findSumNumber(root->right, s);\\n        s.pop_back();\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**Discussion:**\\nNow, the problem with above approach is, we are using extra vector for storing all the paths So, we can do something to eliminate the vector. \\n\\nNow, the idea is to replicate the above solution but we will have one variable name `path` that will store the value from `root-to-leaf` in the form of number on the way i.e. as the recursion goes.\\n\\nWhen we hit the leaf node we will add that number i.e. `path` to our `sum` variable. Also, in order to exlore all paths we will remove the last digit from `path` variable.\\n\\n**Code:**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {\\n        if(!root) return 0;\\n        \\n        int sum = 0;\\n        findSumNumber(root, 0, sum);\\n        return sum;\\n    }\\n    \\n    void findSumNumber(TreeNode* root, int path, int& sum){\\n        if(!root) return;\\n        \\n        path = path*10 + root->val;\\n        \\n        //if the node is a leaf node\\n        if(root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL){\\n            sum += path;\\n            path = path/10;\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        \\n        findSumNumber(root->left, path, sum);\\n        findSumNumber(root->right, path, sum);\\n        path = path/10;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nPlease do let me know, if you have another solution.\\nI hope this helps. \\nThanks \\u270C\\uD83C\\uDFFB\\n",

                "content": "Here\\'s my solution for Python.\\n\\nAny type of tree traversal problem you must decided to first either use recursion OR iterative.  The downside to recursion, aside from being challenging if you don\\'t know the patterns, is that is has the potential for Stackoverflow for very large trees.  I like the iterative approach better, since in order to solve the problem, I\\'ll need to traverse the tree in a DFS fashion.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def sumNumbers(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:\\n        summation = 0\\n        if root is None:\\n            return summation\\n        \\n        stack = [(root, root.val)]\\n        \\n        while len(stack) != 0:\\n            node, running_sum = stack.pop()\\n            \\n            if node.left is None and node.right is None:\\n                summation += running_sum\\n                continue\\n            \\n            if node.left:\\n                new_sum = int(str(running_sum) + str(node.left.val))\\n                stack.append((node.left, new_sum))\\n            if node.right:\\n                new_sum = int(str(running_sum) + str(node.right.val))\\n                stack.append((node.right, new_sum))                \\n                \\n        return summation\\n```\\n\\nAnalysis of time and space complexity is as follows:\\n\\nTime: O(N)\\n    Since I need to traverse through each node to figure out the summations.\\n\\t\\nSpace: O(log N) on average, O(N) worst case\\nExplanation:\\nIf you have unbalanced tree, then the stack reaches N nodes, so its worst case O(N).  To better understand this, imagine a tree that only has node.right branches, and no left branches.  Then DFS traverses through goes through all N nodes to figure out the summation.  \\nIf you have a balanced tree, then you only traverse the depth of the tree (or the height) and thus you only store those nodes in the stack.  To figure out the height of a balanced tree, I recommend google searching the math proof, but that evaluates to O(log N).  So assuming most trees we recieved are balanced, then on average its O(log N).  \\n\\nThe key to solving this problem is recognizing the code pattern used for DFS traversals.  If your not familiar, then I suggest studying the different ways to solve the isValidBST problem\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/\\n\\n",

                "content": "##### Here you can get acquainted with **2 different solutions**. Solutions implemented in **PHP** and **JavaScript**\\n\\n### SOLUTION #1\\nThe approach used in this solution is to traverse the tree using a breadth-first search, and for each node add the values of its children to the sum of its own value. We also use a queue to keep track of the nodes that need to be visited. We start with the root node, and for each node check if it is a leaf node (if it has no children). If it is, add the value of the node to the total sum. If it is not a leaf node, add its children to the queue, and add the node value to the children\\'s values. When the queue is empty, all the nodes have been visited and the sum is returned.\\n*Time complexity*: O(n), as we visit every node in the tree once.\\n*Space complexity*: O(n), as we use a queue to store up to n nodes at any given time.\\n\\n```PHP []\\nclass Solution\\n{\\n    /**\\n     * @param TreeNode $root\\n     * @return Integer\\n     */\\n    function sumNumbers(TreeNode $root): int {\\n        if ($root === null || $root->val === null) return 0;\\n        $totalSum = 0;\\n        $queue = [$root];\\n        while (count($queue) > 0) {\\n            $node = array_shift($queue);\\n            if ($node->left === null && $node->right === null) {\\n                $totalSum += $node->val;\\n            }\\n\\n            if ($node->left) {\\n                $node->left->val = $node->val * 10 + $node->left->val;\\n                $queue[] = $node->left;\\n            }\\n            if ($node->right) {\\n                $node->right->val = $node->val * 10 + $node->right->val;\\n                $queue[] = $node->right;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return $totalSum;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```javascript []\\nvar sumNumbers = function (root) {\\n    let totalSum = 0;\\n    if (root === null || root.val === undefined) return 0;\\n    if (root.left === undefined && root.right === undefined) return root.val;\\n    let queue = [root];\\n\\n    while (queue.length > 0) {\\n        node = queue.shift();\\n        if (node.left === null && node.right == null) {\\n            totalSum += node.val;\\n        }\\n        if (node.left && node.left.val !== undefined) {\\n            node.left.val = node.val * 10 + node.left.val;\\n            queue.push(node.left);\\n        }\\n        if (node.right && node.right.val !== undefined) {\\n            node.right.val = node.val * 10 + node.right.val;\\n            queue.push(node.right);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return totalSum;\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\\n### SOLUTION #2\\nThis solution uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree and calculate the sum of all root-to-leaf path numbers. The DFS function takes in a node and the sum of the existing path up to the node. If the node is null, then it returns 0. If the node is a leaf node, it returns the total sum of the path from the root to the leaf node. If the node has children, then it calls the same DFS function on both of the children, passing in the sum of the existing path up to that node. The sum of all the DFS calls is then returned.\\n*Time Complexity*: O(n) as we have to traverse each node in the binary tree once.\\n*Space Complexity*: O(n) as the maximum depth of the recursive stack can be n for a binary tree with n nodes.\\n\\n```PHP []\\nclass Solution\\n{\\n    /**\\n     * @param TreeNode $root\\n     * @return Integer\\n     */\\n    function sumNumbers(TreeNode $root): int\\n    {\\n        return $this->dfs($root, 0);\\n    }\\n\\n    private function dfs(?TreeNode $node, int $sum): int\\n    {\\n        if ($node === null) {\\n            return 0;\\n        }\\n        if ($node->left === null && $node->right == null) {\\n            return $sum * 10 + $node->val;\\n        }\\n        return $this->dfs($node->left, $sum * 10 + $node->val) +\\n            $this->dfs($node->right, $sum * 10 + $node->val);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```javascript []\\nvar sumNumbers = function (root) {\\n    const dfs = function (node, sum) {\\n        if (node == null) {\\n            return 0;\\n        }\\n        if (node.left === null && node.right == null) {\\n            return sum * 10 + node.val;\\n        }\\n        return dfs(node.left, sum * 10 + node.val) +\\n               dfs(node.right, sum * 10 + node.val);\\n    }\\n    return dfs(root, 0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### If my work was useful for you, please upvote\\n\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83D\\uDC4D",

In that version, we just add root.val and then send the variable away in the recursive calls.  After that, we add what is returned to the sum, then return that sum.  This works great because strings in JS are assign-by-value.  If we send one string to a recursive call, it only effects that call and lower recursive calls - not higher ones.  Alternatively, below that solution we have curPath stored as an array.  In those functions, you\\'ll notice a .push() at the very start, and then a .pop() after the recursive calls.  This is because arrays are assign-by-reference.  When you pass an array (or anything else assign-by-reference), it effects all recursive calls in which it is involved - All can change it on their recursive levels, and it will be reflected in higher recursive levels.  Hence, we need the .pop() as clean up after we have explored that node.  Both assign-by-value and assign-by-reference have their advantages and disadvantages in recursive functions.  You\\'ll also notice we use sum = [0] in some of the other functions.  This is because arrays are pass by reference.  Hence, in lower recursive calls, we can do sum[0] += curPath.join(\\'\\') - 0, and it changes the value with the sum array on All recursive levels and we can just return it at the top level.  In the non-assign-by-reference code examples, you\\'ll notice we have to do sum += \\'whatever we return from recursive call\\' because that call can\\'t change the sum itself.  Hence, if you change the code to sum = 0 within the arguments, and change the logic within the function to match an integer, you\\'ll find it no longer works - This is because integers are assign-by-value.  If you knew all of this already, I apologize for the tangeant.  It\\'s a subject that I struggled with in my coding for a while, so I wanted to add a short aside to address it and maybe help others.\\n\\nTL:DR; You have to code a bit differently in recursive calls when using assign-by-reference vs assign-by-value arguments.  In the below assign-by-reference versions - We add to the variable (curPath), run our recursive calls with it as an argument, and then we remove what we added afterwards (I.E. - Recursion has reached the basecase and popped back up.  In the case of the example in the description - Initial function call pushes 1 to curPath, recursion runs on root.left.  We push 2 to curPath.  We have reached the base case since 2 has no .left or .right.  12 is added to the sum ([1,2].join(\\'\\') - 0 OR +[1,2].join(\\'\\') - both are ways to coerce strings to numbers where possible in JS).  The two is popped off.  We return to the initial function call level.  Function again called on root.right.  On this level, our curPath is again back to [1].  3 is pushed to curPath.  Base case is reached.  [1,3] joined to form 13 and added to sum.  On initial level, we pop the one from curPath.  curPath = [] at the end.  But sum has been changed by lower recursive calls.  We return sum[0].)  In the assign-by-value versions, we add to the variable, send it away in the recursive calls, Do Something With What Is Returned (Add to a total, hashmap, etc), and return the effected variable.)\\n\\n\\ncurPath and sum both assign-by-value:\\n```\\nconst sumNumbers = (root, curPath = \\'\\', sum = 0) => {\\n  curPath += root.val;\\n  if (!root.left && !root.right) sum += +curPath;\\n  root.left && (sum += sumNumbers(root.left, curPath));\\n  root.right && (sum += sumNumbers(root.right, curPath));\\n  return sum;\\n};\\n```\\n\\ncurPath and sum both assign-by-reference:\\n```\\nconst sumNumbers = (root, curPath = [], sum = [0]) => {\\n  curPath.push(root.val);\\n  if (!root.left && !root.right) sum[0] += curPath.join(\\'\\') - 0;\\n  root.left && sumNumbers(root.left, curPath, sum);\\n  root.right && sumNumbers(root.right, curPath, sum);\\n  curPath.pop();\\n  return sum[0];\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\\nAlternate version with helper function instead of all-recursion (This one\\'s likely easier for most to write on the spot in an interview.  Tracking variables through assign-by-reference data structures is sometimes tough without practice.  This is the \\'play it safe\\' and get it right the first time version.  This version is easiest imo because within the recursive function, we only really have to worry about reaching our base case and then changing sum accordingly - We don\\'t have to worry about what we return from the recursive function at all.  Our function itself changes the sum in the parent scope for us and we don\\'t have to worry about passing sum down, what happens on each level, etc...  Only how sum changes when base case is reached.):\\n\\nsum within initial function scope, traverse has access to this function scope and can change it accordingly.  This lets us use sum as an integer (assign-by-value), but still only change it when the base case is reached.\\n```\\nconst sumNumbers = root => {\\n  let sum = 0;\\n  const traverse = (node, curPath = []) => {\\n    curPath.push(node.val);\\n    if (!node.left && !node.right) sum += curPath.join(\\'\\') - 0;\\n    node.left && traverse(node.left, curPath);\\n    node.right && traverse(node.right, curPath);\\n    curPath.pop();\\n  }\\n  traverse(root);\\n  return sum;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\nFinal version.  This one works the same as the second, but does not use array to track total using assign-by-reference.\\n\\nHybrid: curPath is assign-by-reference, sum is assign-by-value:\\n```\\nconst sumNumbers = (root, curPath = [], sum = 0) => {\\n  curPath.push(root.val);\\n  if (!root.left && !root.right) sum += curPath.join(\\'\\') - 0;\\n  root.left && (sum += sumNumbers(root.left, curPath));\\n  root.right && (sum += sumNumbers(root.right, curPath));\\n  curPath.pop();\\n  return sum;\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\\nI lied!  Last version showing objects are assign-by-reference as well.  We track curPath as a string (We add on every level, but don\\'t worry about clean-up because adding on a lower level doesn\\'t effect higher levels.)  We track sum as an object.  I.E. - We can change the value within the object at All recursive levels when base case is reached and the top level will be reflected appropriately - Only reaching our base case changes the total that is returned in assign-by-reference versions.  In assign-by-value, what is returned from function changes our total, and is then returned.).\\n\\nHybrid: curPath is assign-by-value and sum is assign-by-reference.  This one is particularly cool because we can add to curPath on each level without having to worry about clean up, we can also effect the answer only when the base case is reached, and we also don\\'t have to worry about what we return from any call other than the initial one.  This combination of factors leads me to use assign-by-value and assign-by-reference in this fashion as often as possible, because I find it the easiest to code personally.  Using an object here is somewhat pointless though. lol... I just did it to show it\\'s also assign-by-reference.  Normally I\\'d use an array, both work though. (arrays are just objects in js anyway) \\n```\\nconst sumNumbers = (root, curPath = \\'\\', sum = { answer: 0 }) => {\\n  curPath += root.val;\\n  if (!root.left && !root.right) return sum.answer += +curPath;\\n  root.left && sumNumbers(root.left, curPath, sum);\\n  root.right && sumNumbers(root.right, curPath, sum);\\n  return sum.answer;\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\\n",
