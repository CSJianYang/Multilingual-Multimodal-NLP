Clarify\\n1) Does the algorithm I design have to find the secret word within 10 times of guesses? The answer is No, you only need to design an algorithm that can find the secret word in as less times as possible.\\n#### 2. Idea\\nBecause if we find the secret word after 10 times of calling master.guess(), we fail the test case, **let\\'s call master.guess() 10 times or until we find the secret word, whichever comes first**. \\n\\nBecause there is no guanrantee that we can find the secret word within 10 calls, now our goal is to design a algorithm to find the secret word in as less times of calling master.guess() as possible. \\n\\nHow to find the secret word in as less times of calling master.guess() as possible? The answer is **trying to narrow the candidates after each time we call master.guess()**\\n\\nFor now, the structure of our algorithm is:\\n```java\\n//pseudocode version 1\\nfor(int i = 0, matches = 0; i < 10 && matches != 6; i ++){\\n\\tmatches = master.guess(a word in candidate);\\n\\treduce the number of words in candidate\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow the key problem is, **how to narrow the candidates**?\\nwe have `x = master.guess(word)`\\n`if x == 6, we find the secret word, the algorithm ends`\\n`if x != 6, it means secret has exactly x matches with word`\\n\\nBecause secret has exactly x matches with word, we can just search in the candidates, and **only keep the ones that have exact x matches with word**. In this way, we narrow the candidates after we call master.guess(), and guarantee that secret is in candidates left\\n\\nFor now, the structure of our algorithm is changed to \\n```java\\n//pseudocode version 2\\nfor(int i = 0, matches = 0; i < 10 && matches != 6; i ++){\\n\\tmatches = master.guess(a word in candidates);\\n\\n\\tfor(String candidate: candidates){\\n\\t\\tif(matches == getMatches(candidate, word)){\\n\\t\\t\\ttempCandidates.add(candidate);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tcandidates = tempCandidates;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSo we need a helper method to check the number of matches between two words:\\n```java\\nint getMatches(String word1, String word2){\\n\\tint matches = 0;\\n\\tfor(int i = 0; i < 6; i ++){\\n\\t\\tif(word1.charAt(i) == word2.charAt(i)){\\n\\t\\t\\tmatches ++;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow the key problem is **how to select word in candidates as the input of master.guess()?**\\nWe have two options:\\n\\n- option-1: select the first candidate as the input of master.guess() every time\\n- option-2: randomly select one word from candidates as the input of master.guess()\\n\\nWhich is better? The analysis is below:\\n\\np(x) means the possibility of `master.guess(word) == x`, we have \\n`p(x) = C(6, x) * (1/26)^x * (25/26)^(6-x)`\\n\\n`p(0) = 79.03%`\\n`p(1) = 18.97%`\\n`p(2) = 1.90%`\\n`p(3) = 0.10%`\\n`p(4) = 0.003%`\\n`p(5) = 4.85e-5%`\\n`p(6) = 3.24e-7%`\\n\\n- if `master.guess(word) == 0`, we\\'ll keep all the candidates that getMatches(word, candidate), because now word is already known, and all the candidates are generated randomly, so we have p(0) = 79.03% candidates that have 0 matches with word, and the possibility of `master.guess(word) == 0` is 79.03%, so if `master.guess(word) == 0`, we will keep 79.03%*79.03% = 62.45% candidates. \\n- if `master.guess(word) == 1`, we will keep 18.97% * 18.97% = 3.60%\\n- if `master.guess(word) == 2`, we will keep 1.90% * 1.90% = 0.03\\n- if `master.guess(word) == 3`, we will keep 0\\n- if `master.guess(word) == 4`, we will keep 0\\n- if `master.guess(word) == 5`, we will keep 0\\n- if `master.guess(word) == 6`, we will keep 0\\n\\nThe expectation of ratio of candidates we will keep after calling master.guess() is: 66.05% (sum of the percentages above)\\n\\nAt the beginning, we have 100 candidates, after each calling, we keep 66.05% of them\\n| Round of calling guess|  number of candidates left|\\n| :--------: | :--------:| \\n|initiation| 100|\\n| 1  | 66.05 | \\n| 2  | 43.63 |\\n| 3  | 28.81 |\\n| 4  | 19.03 |\\n| 5  | 12.57 |\\n| 6  | 8.30 |\\n| 7  | 5.48 |\\n| 8  | 3.62 |\\n| 9  | 2.39 |\\n| 10  | 0.68 |\\n\\nlet q(x) the possibility that we can find secret in the xth round\\nq(1) = 1/100\\nq(2) = 99/100 * 1/66.05 (didn\\'t find in 1st round but find secret in the 2nd round)\\nq(3) = 99/100 * 65.06/66.05 * 1/43.63 (didn\\'t find in 1st and 2nd round, but find in 3rd round)\\n...\\n\\nafter calculation, q(1) + q(2) + ... q(9) + q(10) = 75.70%\\nSo in this solution, the chance that we can find the secret word within 10 calls is 75.70%\\n\\nBecause all the candidates in wordlist are generated randomly, both option1 and option2 have the same chance 75.70%. But because leetcode only provide 5 test cases for this problem and each wordlist only contains 100 words, in statistic, option2 is better\\n\\nFor now, the structure of our algorithm is changed to \\n```java\\n//pseudocode version 3\\nfor(int i = 0, matches = 0; i < 10 && matches != 6; i ++){\\n\\tmatches = master.guess(randomly select a word in candidates);\\n\\tfor(String candidate: candidates){\\n\\t\\tif(matches == getMatches(candidate, word)){\\n\\t\\t\\ttempCandidates.add(candidate);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tcandidates = tempCandidates;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. Code\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void findSecretWord(String[] wordlist, Master master) {\\n        Random random = new Random();\\n        for(int i = 0, matches = 0; i < 10 && matches != 6; i ++){\\n            String guess = wordlist[random.nextInt(wordlist.length)];\\n            matches = master.guess(guess);\\n            List<String> candidates = new ArrayList<>();\\n            for(String word: wordlist){\\n                if(matches == getMatches(guess, word)){\\n                    candidates.add(word);\\n                }\\n            }\\n            \\n            wordlist = candidates.toArray(new String[0]);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    private int getMatches(String word1, String word2){\\n        int matches = 0;\\n        for(int i = 0; i < word1.length(); i ++){\\n            if(word1.charAt(i) == word2.charAt(i)){\\n                matches ++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return matches;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### 4.

                "content": "The basic idea is to get a similarity score between secret and a `guess`. Say, it\\'s `3`. Then, we compute a similarity score between `guess` and all candidates. If a similarity between `guess` and some other candidate is not `3`, this candidate can be eliminated as it cannot be a secret.\\n\\nAn improvement to this idea is to pick a candidate `guess` in a certain way, so that we maximize the number of candidates we can eliminate each turn. For that, we use the elimination histogram. \\n\\n#### Solution\\nWe compute a position/character histogram for remaining candidates and use it to select the next word to guess (O(n)). After each guess, we eliminate all words with different similarity and update the histogram.\\n\\nIn order to reduce the number of guesses, the strategy is to pick such a word that would maximize the amount of information we can get per each guess. For example, if 30 words start with \\'a\\', and a guess for ```\"a*****\"``` returned ```0```, this single turn eliminates 30 words. So, we can build a histogram of how often each character appears for each position. For example, if our words only contain characters from \\'a\\' to \\'e\\', we can get something like this:\\n![image](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/users/votrubac/image_1527661420.png)\\nAccording to this histogram, the word that would give us maximum information is \"bdaced\" - if this word exists in the list, of course. We need to score each word according to this histogram (in my case, multiply count of each character), and use the one with the highest score.\\n\\nWhile writing this, I got an idea to use synthetic words (\"bdaced\" in our example) to maximize the initial elimination. According to my tests, using a synthetic word for the very first turn gives the best result.\\n\\nI tested the Minimax solution by Lee, and my two solutions when running 10,000 test cases with 100 randombly generated strings, and here are the results:\\nMetric | Minimax | Histogram | Histogram + Synthetic Turn\\n--- | --- | --- | ---\\nTotal runtime | 10306 ms | 15 ms | 13 ms\\nAverage attemts | 5.9578 | 5.5857 | 5.4538\\nMax attemps | 13 | 11 | 11\\n![image](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/users/votrubac/image_1527477618.png)\\n**C++**\\n```cpp\\nint res = 0, probs[6][26] = {};\\nint match(string &w1, string &w2) {\\n    return inner_product(begin(w1), end(w1), begin(w2), 0, plus<int>(), equal_to<char>());\\n}\\nstring bestCandidate(list<string>& words) {\\n    string best;\\n    int max_score = 0;\\n    for (auto w : words) {\\n        int score = 1;\\n        for (auto i = 0; i < 6; ++i)\\n            score *= probs[i][w[i] - \\'a\\'];\\n        if (score > max_score) {\\n            max_score = score;\\n            best = w;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return best;\\n}\\nvoid findSecretWord(vector<string>& wordlist, Master& master) {\\n    list<string> remWords(begin(wordlist), end(wordlist));\\n    auto add_prob = [&](string &w, int d = 1) {\\n        for (auto i = 0; i < 6; ++i)\\n            probs[i][w[i] - \\'a\\'] += d;\\n    };\\n    for_each(begin(wordlist), end(wordlist), add_prob);\\n    while (res < 6) {\\n        auto candidate = bestCandidate(remWords);\\n        res = master.guess(candidate);\\n        for (auto it = remWords.begin(); it != remWords.end(); )\\n            if (match(*it, candidate) != res) {\\n                add_prob(*it, -1);\\n                remWords.erase(it++);\\n            }\\n            else \\n                ++it;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

If we guess a word, we\\'re given its distance from the secret, which allows us to eliminate words whose distance from the guess is different. That is, if we know that the secret is 4 characters away from the guess, then we can eliminate all words whose distance from the guess is not 4, because they can\\'t be the secret.\\n\\nIn order to maximize the number of words we eliminate at each guess, we choose a guess that partitions the potential candidate set roughly equally by all possible distances. That is, if we choose a guess that\\'s roughly equally at distance 0 from 1/6 of all words, distance 1 from 1/6 of all words, etc., we know that whatever distance the secret happens to be from the guess, we can eliminate a substantial number of words. This is where we use a MinMax heuristic. For each word, we compute a histogram of its distance from every word in the candidate set, and then select the word whose histogram peak (max) is smallest (min). That property guarantees that the selected word partitions the candidate set well by distance and that it has the potential to eliminate the maximum number of elements. That\\'s the word we choose as a guess. Once we offer it and obtain its distance from the secret, then we can eliminate all candidates that don\\'t have the same distance to it.\\n\\nWe repeat the same process iteratively, taking words from the full word set, but compute the histogram of their distances to the reduced candidate set only. The reason is that a word that is bad at partitioning the full word set may be good at partitioning the reduced candidate set at a later iteration. Choosing guess words from the full set also allows us to avoid falling into a local optimum valley where the reduced candidate set contains only words that partition it very poorly.\\n\\n\\n**Solution:**\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n\\n    int dist(const string& a, const string &b) \\n    {\\n        // Maybe this can be memoized if too slow.\\n        int dist = 0;\\n

point is that most solutions start from the minmax set and then proceed to use guesses from within the same reduced set. The following test case\\n```\\n\"aaponm\"\\n[\"aazyxw\",\"aayxwv\",\"aaxwvu\",\"aawvut\",\"aavuts\",\"aautsr\",\"aatsrq\",\"aasrqp\",\"aarqpo\",\"aaqpon\",\"aaponm\",\"aaonml\",\"aanmlk\",\"aamlkj\",\"aalkji\",\"aakjih\",\"aajihg\",\"aaihgf\",\"aahgfe\",\"aagfed\",\"aafedc\",\"ccwwww\",\"ccssss\",\"ccoooo\",\"cckkkk\",\"ccgggg\",\"cccccc\",\"ccyyyy\",\"ccuuuu\",\"ccqqqq\",\"ccmmmm\",\"ddwwww\",\"ddssss\",\"ddoooo\",\"ddkkkk\",\"ddgggg\",\"ddcccc\",\"ddyyyy\",\"dduuuu\",\"ddqqqq\",\"ddmmmm\",\"eewwww\",\"eessss\",\"eeoooo\",\"eekkkk\",\"eegggg\",\"eecccc\",\"eeyyyy\",\"eeuuuu\",\"eeqqqq\",\"eemmmm\",\"ffwwww\",\"ffssss\",\"ffoooo\",\"ffkkkk\",\"ffgggg\",\"ffcccc\",\"ffyyyy\",\"ffuuuu\",\"ffqqqq\",\"ffmmmm\",\"ggwwww\",\"ggssss\",\"ggoooo\",\"ggkkkk\",\"gggggg\",\"ggcccc\",\"ggyyyy\",\"gguuuu\",\"ggqqqq\",\"ggmmmm\",\"hhwwww\",\"hhssss\",\"hhoooo\",\"hhkkkk\",\"hhgggg\",\"hhcccc\",\"hhyyyy\",\"hhuuuu\",\"hhqqqq\",\"hhmmmm\",\"iiwwww\",\"iissss\",\"iioooo\",\"iikkkk\",\"iigggg\",\"iicccc\",\"iiyyyy\",\"iiuuuu\",\"iiqqqq\",\"iimmmm\",\"jjwwww\",\"jjssss\",\"jjoooo\",\"jjkkkk\",\"jjgggg\",\"jjcccc\",\"jjyyyy\",\"jjuuuu\",\"jjqqqq\"]\\n10\\n```\\nis constructed in such a way that the initial minmax set has 21 words at the same distance from one another. After the first guess, you reduce your candidates to this group:\\n```\\n\"aazyxw\",\"aayxwv\",\"aaxwvu\",\"aawvut\",\"aavuts\",\"aautsr\",\"aatsrq\",\"aasrqp\",\"aarqpo\",\"aaqpon\",\"aaponm\",\"aaonml\",\"aanmlk\",\"aamlkj\",\"aalkji\",\"aakjih\",\"aajihg\",\"aaihgf\",\"aahgfe\",\"aagfed\",\"aafedc\"\\n```\\nBut since each word in this set is at equal distance, if you only use guesses from within that set, you can eliminate at most one word for each guess. \\n\\nThe trick is that you should continue to use the complete word list to generate guesses. I.e. take words from outside of your current reduced set of potential guesses, and use them to calculate the minmax that would best partition the guess set . That way you can reduce the guess set signifcantly.\\n\\nFor example, if your second guess is \"aazyxw\", you eliminate only 1 word, but if you use an outside word like \"ccwwww\", you can eliminate 4 words (\"aazyxw\",\"aayxwv\",\"aaxwvu\",\"aawvut\"), etc.\\n",

                "content": "The solution to this problem depends on two observations.\\n\\n**1. If word has score x > 0, only those words that share exactly x characters with word can be the solution.**\\n\\n e.g. suppose guess(\"xyz\") = 1.\\n\\n  - \"abc\" cannot be the solution because it shares 0 letters with \"xyz\". \"xyz\" has a score of 1 so \"abc\" must have at least 1 letter wrong, so cannot be  the solution.\\n\\n  - \"zxy\" cannot be the solution because it shares 0 letters (in the right  place) with \"xyz\", so it must have at least one letter wrong.\\n\\n  - \"ayz\" cannot be the solution because it shares 2 letters with \"xyz\". If   \"ayz\" were the solution then \"xyz\" would have a score of 2.\\n\\n  - \"abz\" can be the solution because it shares 1 letter with \"xyz\"\\n\\n We can use this idea to quickly filter the word list:\\n \\n ```\\n class Solution:\\n    def findSecretWord(self, wordlist: List[str], master: \"Master\") -> None:\\n        while wordlist:\\n            word = wordlist.pop()\\n            matches = master.guess(word)\\n            # only those words that share exactly x characters with word can be\\n            # the solution.\\n            wordlist = [\\n                other\\n                for other in wordlist\\n                if matches == sum(w == o for w, o in zip(word, other))\\n            ]\\n```\\n\\nBut this on its own is not sufficient. We need to shrink the list faster for the big test cases. Which requires the second observation.\\n\\n**2. We eliminate more words by choosing words that are more similar to the rest of the wordlist**\\n\\nIf `guess(\"xyz\") > 0` then we can eliminate words that are dissimilar to \"xyz\" (see above). But we can elminate words that are _similar_ to \"xyz\" if `guess(\"xyz\") is == 0`. For large wordlists, the overwhelming fraction of words in wordlist will have a score of 0. (Fun problem: compute this fraction for a randomly generated wordlist of size N.)\\n \\n Given `guess()` returns 0 most of the time for large wordlists, we can, on average eliminate more words per guess by choosing words that are more similar to the rest of\\n the corpus.\\n\\nWe can do this by sorting the words in order of \"similarity to the rest of the corpus\". You can do this pretty much any reasonable way and pass the LeetCode testcases. But just as an example, here\\'s a solution in which we assign each letter at each position a \"weight\" equal to the number of times that letter occurs at that position across entire wordlist. Each word\\'s similarity to the rest of the corpus is then the sum of these weights for its letters.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findSecretWord(self, wordlist: List[str], master: \"Master\") -> None:\\n        # e.g. if wordlist = [\"xy\", \"ab\", \"xz\"]\\n        # then weights = [{x: 2, a: 1}, {b: 1, y:1, z:1}]\\n        weights = [Counter(word[i] for word in wordlist) for i in range(6)]\\n\\n        # sort wordlist, least similar to rest of corpus first\\n        wordlist.sort(key=lambda word: sum(weights[i][c] for i, c in enumerate(word)))\\n\\n        while wordlist:\\n            # get the word most similar to the rest of the corpus by popping\\n            # from the *end* of wordlist\\n            word = wordlist.pop()\\n            matches = master.guess(word)\\n            # only those words that share exactly x characters with word can be\\n            # the solution.\\n            wordlist = [\\n                other\\n                for other in wordlist\\n                if matches == sum(w == o for w, o in zip(word, other))\\n            ]\\n```\\n",

                "content": "Alright, first, let us clarify something first.\\n\\n**The point of this question is not really to solve it in 10 guesses or less. The idea is to solve it in as few guesses as possible. It is important to make this clarification in an interview. Certain  test-cases will never work if you only have 10 guesses.  Ex. {\"aaaaaa\",\"bbbbbb\", \"cccccc,..... \"zzzzzz.  Also, it is emphasized that these words are RANDOMLY generated, thus a case like this is HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY  unlikely. So you approach the problem based on more likely scenarios, which in this case, is randomness. **\\n\\n**Pre-requisites**\\n\\n- You have to undestand somethig about probability here.  \\n\\n****\\t\\tIf i tell you I have a random letter  in my back pocket, and ask you to guess any letter in the alphabet, the odds that you get it WRONG is  25/26. So you only have 1/26 chance of guessing correctly. This is because, out of the 26 charcters in the alphabet, only 1 of those letters will be the correct answer, and 25 will not be. Thus you have a 25/26 chance of getting it WRONG. \\n\\nNow, if we have a 2 six letter words. Let us say the first words is our SECRET word, and the second is a word in the list given to us. The same logic applies. In position 1  of our Secret word, there is a letter. We do not know what the letter is, but we have a letter also in position 1 of our second word. The odds of the the letter in position 1 in our second word being the same as the letter in position 1 of our Secret word is again, 1/26, because of all the letters, only 1 will match, and 25 will not. So odds of not matching the letter in that position is 25/26. Then the same applies for the letters in position 2,3,4,5, and 6.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n****\\t\\t\\tThus, if we want to calculate the probability of all of those letters NOT MATCHING, then the probability is as follows\\n**\\t\\t\\t\\t(25/26) * (25/26) * (25/26) * (25/26) * (25/26) * (25/26) = (25/26)^6 == 80%\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nThat is just how the math is done when calculating compounding probablities. Same case if you flip a coin twice and ask for the probability of \"heads.\"  Probability of getting head if only 1 toss is 50/100, probability of getting heads on 2 tosses is  (50/100 ) * (50 / 100) == 25%.\\n\\nAnyways, now we have established that the **probability of a word, not matching the Secret word in any positions is 80%.** So we know that whenever we guess, we have an 80% chance of getting 0 matches. To understand how we are going to use probability that we came up with, we have to understand how we can narrow our options in the list.\\n\\n**There are 7 cases that could happen when we make a guess. Either we get 0 matches with secret, or 1 match, or 2 matches....3,4,5 or 6 matches. Here is what we do. This is key when solving many leetcode questions. Just break down your problem into all divergances / cases.\\n**\\n**EXAMPLES\\n\\n**0 Matches**: Eliminate all words in the list that have any matches with the CURRENT GUESS word. Because if our current word has 0 matches with the Secret word, and another word matches this Current guess word in 1 place, it is guaranteed to not be the secret word.\\n\\n**1 Matches**: Eliminate all words in the list that don\\u2019t match exactly 1 match with this current word. If a word in the list has less than 1 match, then it is guaranteed to not be the secret word, because we know it will not have that 1 character in the right place, otherwise it would have matched this current word. \\n\\nAlternatively, if another word in the list has more than 1 matches with this current word, we know that it is not the secret word, because it is matching wrong characters in other places of this current word that we know are not in secret because they did not match.\\n\\n**2 Matches,  3 Matches, 4 Matches, and 5 Matches** : Same logic as 1 Match.\\n\\n**6 Matches**: We found the Secret word.\\n\\n\\n**KEY IDEA:** So that is our strategy. How do we pick our word? This is where the probability comes in. We know that no matter what word we pick in the Word List, there is an 80% chance it will match the Secret word in 0 places. So Master.guess will return 0 **most** of the time. We know based on the strategy above, that if we guess a word and we get 0 matches, then we eliminate all words in the word list that have even 1 match with the current word we guessed.  So can you figure it out? How do we pick which word to guess now?\\n\\nWe guess the word that has the largest \"similarity\" with other words in the word list first. As in the word that has the least number of 0 matches when it comes to comparing it with other words in the word list. So we Map each word to an Integer which represents the number of words in the word list in which this curr word can get atleast one Match. \\n\\nThen we start choosing words in descending order based on their map value. \\n\\n**Recap: We know that most of the time, 80% of the time actually, Master.guess wil return 0, and we know that when we get a 0, we can eliminate all the words in the list that have 1 or more matches with the word that we guessed, thus choosing the word that has more words that match it in atleast 1 position will result in the most eliminations, and thus, narrowing our list down most.**\\n\\n**Note: Sure, there can be a better choice in the wordlist that will eliminate more words. but the key is to remember that you are working with a quality of randomness where you just don\\'t know. So you use propbablity to your advantage. We know that 80 % of the time, we will get a 0 match with master.guess, so we adjust our strategy to tailor more to that scenario, because given a large enough data set, it is the best approach.**\\\\\\n\\nHere is how the code works.\\n\\n1 - Compare every two Words. Insert each word into a HashMasp, and map it to an Integer that will represent the number of other words in this list that have atleast 1 match with this word.\\n2 - Sort the original list based on the mapped value, in descending order. So the greater the Integer, the more \"first\" it will be.\\n3 - Start guessing from the begining of the list. Apply the strategy above based on the match. Add all the words that \"pass\" onto the next round into a new list, and then do the same thing with the new list. We do not have to sort, new list will already be sorted based on logic. If no words get eliminated, then update the list to the same list but without the element that you just guessed.\\n\\n**This question is about randomness and probabilty, not realy about the 10 guesses. Like I said at the begining. This code will fail given the above test case {aaaaaa,bbbbbb,cccccc.....zzzzzz}, but this code passes here, because...........RANDOM!\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n  \\n    public void findSecretWord(String[] wordlist, Master master) {\\n         HashMap<String,Integer> map = new HashMap();\\n         HashSet<String> eliminated = new HashSet();\\n        for(int i = 0; i < wordlist.length - 1; i++){\\n           for(int j = i+1; j < wordlist.length; j++){\\n            String word1 = wordlist[i];\\n            String word2 = wordlist[j];\\n               if(!map.containsKey(word1)) map.put(word1,0);\\n               if(!map.containsKey(word2)) map.put(word2,0);\\n               if(comparee(word1,word2) > 0){\\n                   map.put(word1,map.get(word1) + 1);\\n                   map.put(word2,map.get(word1) + 1);\\n               }\\n           }\\n        }\\n        \\n             \\n        Arrays.sort(wordlist, new Comparator<String>(){\\n            public int compare(String w1, String w2){\\n                return map.get(w2) - map.get(w1);\\n            }\\n        });\\n\\n        \\n        for(int i = 0; i < wordlist.length; i++){\\n            String word = wordlist[i];\\n            if(word.length() == 0) continue;            \\n             int count = master.guess(word);\\n            if(count == 6) break;\\n            clean(word,i+1,count,wordlist);\\n        }\\n\\n    \\n    }\\n    \\n    public void clean(String word, int start , int count,String[] wordlist){\\n        for(int i = start; i < wordlist.length; i++){\\n            String currWord = wordlist[i];\\n            if(currWord.length() == 0) continue;\\n            if(comparee(word,currWord) != count) wordlist[i] = \"\";\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    \\n    public int comparee(String w1, String w2){\\n        int count = 0;\\n        for(int i = 0; i < w1.length(); i++){\\n            if(w1.charAt(i) == w2.charAt(i)) count++;\\n        }\\n        return count;\\n    }\\n}\\n``",

                "content": "At start of the game, we simply have the choice of using each word in the wordlist to call master API, but as we are getting more and more feedbacks from the API, we should eliminate some choice by only keeping the words that have the same number of character matches as the match number returned from the master API. Then we use those words as the possible choices in the next round.\\n\\nSimply adapting the above strategy should give us a pretty good performance in terms of minimizing the number of calls to the master API. However, we could use minimax strategy to further improve the accuracy of our guesses at each round by avoiding choices that has little or no effect of reducing the number of choices we have to make in the next round.\\n\\nThe idea is simply to make a choice that minimizes the maximum possible number of choices (worst outcome) we have to make at each time that we call ```master.guess(word)```. \\n\\n*Note: caching all the similarity between two words is not necessary because the computation is constant time given the length of the string is a constant\\n\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    int N = 6;\\n    \\n    public void findSecretWord(String[] words, Master master) {\\n        Set<Integer> options = new HashSet<>();\\n        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) options.add(i);\\n        while (options.size() > 0) {\\n            int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n            int minIdx = -1;\\n            for (int i : options) {\\n                int max = maxLoss(i, words, options);\\n                if (max < min) {\\n                    min = max;\\n                    minIdx = i;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            int match = master.guess(words[minIdx]);\\n            //made the correct guess, return\\n            if (match == N) return;\\n            Set<Integer> next = new HashSet<>();\\n            for (int i : options) {\\n                if (similarity(words[minIdx], words[i]) == match) {\\n                    next.add(i);\\n                }\\n            }\\n            options = next;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    private int maxLoss(int wordIdx, String[] words, Set<Integer> options) {\\n        int[] bucket = new int[N];\\n        int maxLoss = 0;\\n        for (int i : options) {\\n            if (!words[wordIdx].equals(words[i])) {\\n                int sim = similarity(words[wordIdx], words[i]);\\n                bucket[sim]++;\\n                maxLoss = Math.max(maxLoss, bucket[sim]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return maxLoss;\\n    }\\n    \\n    private int similarity(String s1, String s2) {\\n        int match = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\\n            match += s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(i) ? 1 : 0;\\n        }\\n        return match;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

The similarity is just the count of positions where the two words match.\\n\\nThe main logic happens in the `for` loop. I pop the most similar word (explained below), calculate the score, and filter the list of words.\\n\\nHow are the words filtered? If `master.guess(w1) = 3` for instance, that means the **similarity** (as I defined it) between `w1` and the correct word is 3. So I filter out any word whose similarity does not equal score (remember the answer is in the pool of words and `master.guess` is simply returning `similarity[w1][answer]`).\\n\\nThis by itself is already enough but not good enough for the arbitrary 10 guess limit of this problem. So I use the following strategy to choose the next word from the pool of remaining words:\\nChoose the word which has the maximum sum of similarities with other words. Why? It means that word shares a lot with many other words which means if that word is actually far off from the correct answer then we filter out a large number of words in the final step of the for loop.\\n\\n## TL;DR\\n\\n1. precompute similarity (count of matching positions) between all pairs of words\\n2. each iteration pop a word which has the highest similarity with other words among the words left\\n3. calculate score (similarity with the answer)\\n4. filter out all words which don\\'t share that similarity, because `master.guess(w1) == similarity[w1][answer]`",

                "content": "We are given a set of 100 words, from which one was selected to be the secret. \\nEach word was generated randomly.\\nWithin 10 guesses we have to find the secret word.\\nThe general idea was implemented many times in the discussion section but how to pick the right guesses is plain wrong.\\n\\nLet\\'s cover the overall steps:\\n1. Pick a word (not randomly! We will discuss this in a moment)\\n2. Run it using the MASTER black box and get back the number of matches with the secret word\\n3. If it\\'s 6 - return (we found it!)\\n4. Else - eliminate all the words that don\\'t have the exact same amount of matches with the word from step 1 \\n\\nThese four steps, as I mentioned, can be seen at any post but they usually get steps 1 and 4 wrong.\\nLet\\'s start with step 4: Why do we need EXACTLY the same amount of matches between the word from step 1 and the master and the word from step 1 with the words we try to eliminate?\\nIt\\'s because if we have too few matches, the tested word can\\'t possibly be the secret word as it\\'s missing crucial letters.\\nE.g: secret word: \"abcde\". word from step1: \"aaccf\" (2 matches). word from step4: \"abkde\" (1 match with \"aaccf\").\\nNote something interesting: \"abkde\" has more matches with the secret word than the word from step1, it\\'s almost a perfect match, but because it matches only 1 letter from the word from step1 (and not two) we know for a fact that it can\\'t be the secret word.\\n\\nOk, but what about words that have more than the needed matches?\\nE.g: secret word: \"abcde\". word from step1: \"aaccf\" (2 matches). word from step4: \"aacde\" (3 matches with \"aaccf\").\\nSince the word from step1 has 2 matches, we know it has (word.length - matches == 3) mismatches.\\nAny additional match between the word from step1 and step4 means a mismatch for the word in step4\\n\\nIt\\'s crucial to get our heads around this as the wrong logic in step4 can render our solution not good enough\\n\\nLet\\'s get to the meat of it: How do we choose the right word in step1?\\nLet me tell you from the get-go - you might pass a few submissions to leetcode by choosing a random word, but eventually, it will fail every now and then. Also, picking a random word without explaining the idea behind it won\\'t fair well for you in an interview.\\n\\nSo, what\\'s the right heuristic? We want to pick the word that has the most matches with all of the other words in the wordlist.\\nWhy is that?\\nSimple combinatorics will tell us that the chance of any two words in our wordlist to have any match on both letter and index is ~20% (1/26 ^ 6). Which is bad! Think about it, every two words you pick are most likely to not share a single match.\\nPicking a random word each time means you are 80% likely to return 0 matches from the master which is very bad for our algorithm as we can\\'t rule out any of the other words.\\n\\nHow can we find the word with the most matches you ask? \\nWe are going to build a frequency map where at each one of the 6 indexes we check what is the most frequent letter and then choose words with the highest \"score\" (meaning, it has as many matches as possible with the other words in the wordlist)\\n\\nArmed with these understandings, implementing the code is easy. Good luck (and feel free to ask questions in the comments)\\n\\n```\\nvar findSecretWord = function(wordlist, master) {\\n    let MAX_TRIES = 10;\\n    \\n    let badWords = new Set();\\n    \\n    let freq = generateLettersFreq(wordlist);\\n    \\n    for(let i = 0; i < MAX_TRIES; i++) {        \\n        let word = getNextWord(wordlist, badWords, freq);\\n        \\n        let matches = master.guess(word);\\n        if(matches == 6) return;\\n        \\n        reduceGuessSpace(word, matches, wordlist, badWords);\\n        badWords.add(word);\\n    }\\n    \\n};\\n\\nlet generateLettersFreq = (wordlist) => {\\n    let freq = new Array(6).fill().map(() => new Array(26).fill(0));\\n    for(let w of wordlist) {\\n        for(let i = 0; i < w.length; i++) {\\n            freq[i][w.codePointAt(i) - 97]++;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    return freq;\\n}\\n\\nlet getNextWord = (wordlist, badWords, freq) => {\\n    let bestWord = \"\";\\n    let bestScore = -Infinity;\\n    \\n    for(let w of wordlist) {\\n        let wordScore = 0;\\n        for(let i = 0; i < w.length; i++) {\\n            wordScore += freq[i][w.codePointAt(i) - 97];\\n        }\\n        \\n        if(wordScore > bestScore && !badWords.has(w)) {\\n            bestWord = w;\\n            bestScore = wordScore;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    return bestWord;\\n    \\n}\\n\\nlet reduceGuessSpace = (word, mathces, wordlist, badWords) => {\\n    for(let w of wordlist) {\\n        let countMatches = 0;\\n        for(let i = 0; i < w.length; i++)\\n            if(word[i] == w[i]) countMatches++;\\n        \\n        if(countMatches != mathces) badWords.add(w);\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

                "content": "We can summarize the optimal process as so:\\n\\nWe know if we guess a word from the word list, one of three things will occur:\\n\\t1. score = 6 -> We found the secret and can stop :)\\n\\t2. score = 0 -> We can remove any words with overlapping chars. Since they share common chars, and we know all of the chars in the current word are wrong, then no words with any overlap will be the secret.\\n\\t3. score = 1,2,3,4,5 = k -> We know that k chars are correct in our current word. Thus, if another word does not share exactly k overlapping characters with our word, it also is not the secret and we can remove it.\\n\\nThis process is *almost* sufficient. The problem here is with the above approach alone, we can\\'t guarantee we remove \"bad\" words at a fast enough rate to guarantee we can get the correct secret within the first 10 guesses.\\n\\nWhy is that the case? Consider that some words might not overlap with any other words at all.\\n\\nHere is an example test case:\\n\\n```\\n\"hahaha\"\\n[\"bbbbbb\", \"cccccc\", \"dddddd\", \"eeeeee\", \"ffffff\", \"gggggg\", \"iiiiii\", \"jjjjjj\", \"kkkkkk\", \"llllll\", \"mmmmmm\", \"nnnnnn\", \"oooooo\", \"pppppp\", \"qqqqqq\", \"rrrrrr\", \"ssssss\", \"tttttt\", \"uuuuuu\", \"vvvvvv\", \"wwwwww\", \"xxxxxx\", \"yyyyyy\", \"zzzzzz\", \"hahaha\"]\\n10\\n```\\n\\nHere we see that none of the words overlap with each other, and so our best bet would be to try all of them. But *wait*! The key to interviews is to **understand the problem**.\\n\\n\"**For each test case**, you have exactly 10 guesses to guess the word. At the end of any number of calls, if you have made 10 or fewer calls to Master.guess and at least one of these guesses was secret, then you pass the test case.\"\\n\\nSo while we could probably guarantee some approach to say 26 attempts (someone correct me if my math is wrong), for this problem, we just need to optimize it to get to 10 or less **for the given test cases**.\\n\\nThus, the missing piece we can infer from above is that we minimize our problem space more quickly when we test words that overlap with others. The reason being, if the overlap between two words is non-zero (and assuming the words are distinct it is also not 6), then the more overlaps the more chances we get to cut out words that don\\'t fit our invariant.\\n\\nMy Python code is below. If anyone has suggestions, feel free to comment. In no way do I believe my code is perfect, but maybe it could help someone see the problem from this perspective.\\n\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def findSecretWord(self, wordlist, master):\\n        wordsLeft = set(wordlist)\\n        def overlap(wordA, wordB):\\n            return sum([1 if wordA[i]==wordB[i] else 0 for i in range(6)])\\n        \\n        def mostOverlap():\\n            seen = {}\\n            for word in wordsLeft:\\n                for index, char in enumerate(word):\\n                    try:\\n                        seen[char][index] += 1\\n                    except KeyError:\\n                        seen[char] = [0]*6\\n                        seen[char][index] += 1\\n            bestWord, maxOverlap = \"\", -1\\n            for word in wordsLeft:\\n                score = sum([seen[char][index] for index, char in enumerate(word)])\\n                if score > maxOverlap:\\n                    maxOverlap = score\\n                    bestWord = word\\n            return bestWord\\n        \\n        for i in range(10):\\n            if len(wordsLeft) == 0: return\\n            word = mostOverlap()\\n            wordsLeft.remove(word)\\n            matches = master.guess(word)\\n            if matches == 6: break\\n            for wordB in wordsLeft.copy():\\n                overlaps = overlap(word, wordB)\\n                if matches == 0 and overlaps != 0:\\n                    wordsLeft.remove(wordB)\\n                if matches != 0 and overlaps != matches:\\n                    wordsLeft.remove(wordB)  \\n        return                       \\n```\\n\\nThank you for reading and good luck on your interviews!",

Now with `c\\'` as our new candidates pool, we loop back to step0, until we stop at `m == 6`\\n\\n##### python\\nNote, we will implement `choose_word` in the next section\\n```python\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    # count the number of matching characters\\n    def matchNum(self, a, b):\\n        return sum(c1 == c2 for c1, c2 in zip(a, b))\\n\\n    # heuristic to choose the next word\\n    def choose_candidate(self, candidates):\\n        # TODO, implemeht this heuristic of finding the next candidate for master.guess()\\n        \\n    def findSecretWord(self, wordlist, master):\\n        candidates = wordlist[:] # deep copy wordlist, so that we don\\'t change the original list content  \\n        while candidates:        # while candidates is not empty\\n            x = self.choose_candidate(candidates)     \\n            m = master.guess(x)\\n            if m == 6:\\n                return\\n            candidates = [w for w in candidates if self.matchNum(x, w) == m]\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n##  --------------- PART 2: Heuristics of Finding the next chosen word  ---------------\\n**Next is where things start to get more interesting: what\\'s the best approach to choose word `x` from candidates in step1 in each iteration, so that we reduce the number of guesses? We need a heuristic function**\\n### Solution 1\\n`Random`: the problem mentions that all words candidates are generated randomly, so we just choose word at a random index as the lucky one.\\n\\n##### python\\n```\\n    # heuristic to choose the next word\\n    def choose_candidate(self, candidates):\\n        return random.choice(candidates)\\n```\\n\\n##### reference\\n - [solution 2 in lee215\\'s post](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-the-word/discuss/133862)\\n \\n### Solution 2 \\nUse the word `x` that has the `minimum number of words that have 0 mathces to x`, see implementation in function `most_overlap_word()` in this [post](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-the-word/discuss/160945)\\n1. we have a guess word `x` chosen, which has `m` overlap chars with the target\\n2. compare guess word `x`, and use number of mathes to bucket other candidates properly bucket range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\\n3. use probability knowledge, we could easily figure that bucket 0 should be bucket with most number of candidates: `propability = POWER((25/26), 6) = 80%`\\n4. we want to find a word that overlaps most with other words so that we could eliminate all words that might have 0 matches with the guess word, this would help us to eliminate bucket 0, which has highest chance of containing more words, and reach the secret asap.\\n\\n##### python\\n```\\n    # heuristic to choose the next word\\n    def choose_candidate(self, candidates):\\n\\t\\t# for each of 6 position, we compute the histogram of each character count\\n        counts = [collections.defaultdict(int) for _ in range(6)]\\n        for word in candidates:\\n            for index, character in enumerate(word):\\n                counts[index][character] += 1\\n\\t\\t# return the word that has most overlap with others\\n        return max(candidates, key = lambda word : sum(counts[i][c] for i, c in enumerate(word)))\\n```\\n\\nThe above solution uses `sum` as heuristic, we could also use `prod` as heristic (needs to import numpy)\\n```\\n        return max(candidates, key = lambda word : numpy.prod(counts[i][c] for i, c in enumerate(word)))\\n```\\n\\n##### reference\\n - [solution 4 in lee215\\'s post](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-the-word/discuss/133862)\\n - [Python O(n) with maximum overlap heuristic](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-the-word/discuss/160945)\\n\\n### Solution 3\\n`Histogram`: most overlapped candidate synthetic\\n1. for each of 6 position, we compute the histogram of each character count\\n2. the synthetic word is it the max(char) in each position\\n\\n##### python\\nNote: this solution would work if master.guess(syntheticWord) returns the number of matches instead of -1 in the testing system\\n```\\n    # heuristic to choose the next word\\n    def choose_candidate(self, candidates):\\n        counts = [collections.defaultdict(int) for _ in range(6)]\\n        for word in candidates:\\n            for index, character in enumerate(word):\\n                counts[index][character] += 1\\n        return \\'\\'.join([max(hist, key = hist.get) for hist in counts])\\n```\\n\\n##### reference\\n - [C++ elimination histogram, beats Minimax](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-the-word/discuss/134087)\\n\\n### Solution 4\\n`Histogram`: most balanced candidate\\n1. for each word in candidates `c`, we compute histogram, and place all other words into 0-6 buckets, according to their distance\\n2. to choose the candidate with most `balanced` distribution of buckets, whoose the word with min(max(hist)) \\n\\n##### python\\n```\\n    # heuristic to choose the next word\\n    def choose_candidate(self, candidates):\\n        if len(candidates) is 1: # use special judgement here, otherwise \"ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence in return statement in last line\"\\n            return candidates[0]\\n        wordHist = {word : collections.defaultdict(int) for word in candidates}\\n        for i in range(len(candidates)):\\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(candidates)):\\n                m = self.matchNum(candidates[i], candidates[j])\\n                wordHist[candidates[i]][m] += 1\\n                wordHist[candidates[j]][m] += 1\\n        return min(wordHist.keys(), key = lambda w : max(wordHist.get(w).values()))\\n```\\n\\n##### reference\\n - [Optimal MinMax Solution (+ extra challenging test cases)](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-the-word/discuss/134251)\\n \\n",

                "content": "The explaination given in Solution is too terse to understand and it took me a while to figure what it\\'s doing. Now that I have figured it (I think) I\\'d like to share my understanding.\\n\\nThere are 2 parts to this problem. Understanding 1st part is straight forward and I won\\'t spend a lot of time on it. 2nd part is where the magic is.\\n\\nTo begin with, forget Minimax, let\\'s start from scratch.\\n\\n#### deifnitions\\nI am going to use the word similarity a lot and here is how I define it (this shouldn\\'t come as surprise):\\n```\\nint similarity(String s1, String s2) {\\n\\tint res = 0;\\n\\tfor(int k=0; k<words[i].length(); ++k) if(s1.charAt(k) == s2.charAt(k)) ++res;\\n\\treturn res;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet S be the set of words given to us.\\nLet T be the target word.\\n\\n#### Part 1\\n\\nLet\\'s say you guessed word G. Let x = similarity(G, T).\\nObvious way to know what next word to choose is to is to find all words in S which have similarity of x with respect to word G.\\nKeep iterating and you\\'ll find the right word.\\n\\nSide note, clear way to make this take less number to attempts is to keep track of all the guesses you did with their similarity with T. So now you have a map/dict which looks like:\\n```\\n{\\n\\tG1 -> x1,\\n\\tG2 -> x2\\n\\t...\\n}\\n```\\nNow your next guess should be at exact those similarities from previous guess. So if your next guess was Gn then:\\nx1 = similarity(G1, Gn)\\nx2 = similarity(G2, Gn)\\netc.\\nBut this is not good enough.\\n\\n#### Part 2\\nThis is the most intersting part of problem. \\n\\nLet G0 be the 1st guess you made and let x = similarity(G0, T).\\nAll words which are at x similarity from T will lie on a circle at distance x from T.\\nLet all such words be {G0, G1, G2 and G3}, lets calll this set P1 and the visualisation will look as follows:\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/user4453/image_1583552193.png)\\n\\nKey observation here is T is equi-distant (or equi-similarty) from all words in P1.\\n\\nFor every guess you make you want to come closer to T. So if you find every word in S which are as equi-distant (or equi-similarty) from P1 you\\'ll keep getting closer to T.\\n\\nTo visualise, let\\'s say you found that a word G4 in S is exactly equi-similarty from all words in P1, then G4 will be T. This is the curx of it all. As in code below, we are minimising the max-similarty of next candidate in lines:\\n```\\nint thisMaxVotes = votes[0];\\nfor (int j = 0; j < 7; ++j) thisMaxVotes = Math.max(thisMaxVotes, votes[j]);\\n\\nif(minVotes > thisMaxVotes) {\\n\\tminVotes = thisMaxVotes;\\n\\tres = i;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow let\\'s say the next best word G4 which was as equi-similarty from all words in P1 as possible but was not exactly at same similarty. It\\'d appear like so:\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/user4453/image_1583553099.png)\\n\\nAs an excercise, argue what\\'d happen if G4 lies outside the circle.\\n\\nHere is the java code\\n```\\n\\n\\n/**\\n * // This is the Master\\'s API interface.\\n * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation\\n * interface Master {\\n *     public int guess(String word) {}\\n * }\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\n    private int[][] simi;\\n    private int N;\\n    private String[] words;\\n    private HashSet<Integer> used;\\n    private List<Integer> candi;\\n    public void findSecretWord(String[] wordlist, Master master) {\\n        N = wordlist.length;\\n        words = wordlist;\\n        simi = new int[N][N];\\n        for(int i=0; i<N; ++i) {\\n            for(int j=i+1; j<N; ++j) {\\n                simi[i][j] = simi[j][i] = compare(i, j);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        used = new HashSet<>();\\n        candi = new ArrayList<>();\\n        for(int i=0; i<N; ++i) candi.add(i);\\n            \\n        int counter = 0;\\n\\n        while(true) {\\n            int guess = next();\\n            int thisSim = master.guess(words[guess]);\\n            \\n            ++counter;\\n            // System.out.println(counter + \" \" + guess);\\n            \\n            if(thisSim == 6) return;\\n            \\n            used.add(guess);\\n            List<Integer> candi2 = new ArrayList<>();\\n            for(int i:candi) if(simi[guess][i] == thisSim) candi2.add(i);\\n            candi=candi2;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    \\n    private int next() {\\n        int res = -1;\\n        int minVotes = candi.size();\\n        \\n        for(int i=0; i<N; ++i) {\\n            if(used.contains(i)) continue;\\n            \\n            int[] votes = new int[7];\\n            \\n            for(int j:candi) {\\n                if(j==i) continue;\\n                ++votes[simi[j][i]];\\n            }\\n            \\n            int thisMaxVotes = votes[0];\\n            for (int j = 0; j < 7; ++j) thisMaxVotes = Math.max(thisMaxVotes, votes[j]);\\n            \\n            if(minVotes > thisMaxVotes) {\\n                minVotes = thisMaxVotes;\\n                res = i;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return res;\\n    }\\n    \\n    private int compare(int i, int j) {\\n        int res = 0;\\n        for(int k=0; k<words[i].length(); ++k) if(words[i].charAt(k) == words[j].charAt(k)) ++res;\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n",

Instead of wishing to be lucky (use random guesses), I think we should find a way to guarantee that we definitely pass the tests within 10 guesses. And my way is to find a `typical word` in a wordlist, and use it to get a guess result, and then `minimize the wordlist` with the guess result, and then continue to find a typical word in the minimized wordlist, and so on...\\n#### **What is a typical word in a wordlist?**\\nA `typical word` is a word that `have the most common with other words` in the wordlist. Here I use a simple version of typical word. Instead of comparing the whole word, I compared letters in the same position to find the letters that occured the most times, and then get a typical word. (If the guess times are even more limited, I think we should find a typical word by comparing the whole word)\\n#### **Why typical word?**\\nBy guessing with a typical word, we get to know how the most words in the wordlist match the secret key. (Because in some test cases there are many words that have no common with the secret key or most of the words in the wordlist, we should try to avoid guessing with those words.)\\n\\n```\\nvar findSecretWord = function(wordlist, master) {\\n    let group = wordlist;\\n    for(let i=0; i<10; i++){\\n    \\tlet currentGuess = findTheTypical(group);\\n    \\tlet res = master.guess(currentGuess);\\n    \\tif(res===6) return;\\n    \\tlet tmp = [];\\n    \\tfor(let j=0; j<group.length; j++){\\n    \\t\\tif(diff(group[j], currentGuess)===6-res) tmp.push(group[j]);\\n    \\t}\\n    \\tgroup=tmp;\\n    }\\n};\\nfunction findTheTypical(wordlist){\\n\\tlet count = Array.from({length:6}, x=>new Object());\\n\\tfor(let i=0; i<wordlist.length; i++){\\n\\t\\tfor(let j=0; j<6; j++){\\n\\t\\t\\tlet cur = wordlist[i][j];\\n\\t\\t\\tif(count[j][cur]===undefined) count[j][cur]=1;\\n\\t\\t\\telse count[j][cur]++;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\tlet maxPos=0, maxCount=0, maxAlp =\\'\\';\\n\\tfor(let i=0; i<6; i++){\\n\\t\\tfor(let k of Object.keys(count[i])){\\n\\t\\t\\tif(count[i][k]>maxCount){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaxCount = count[i][k];\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaxPos = i;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaxAlp = k;\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\tfor(let i=0; i<wordlist.length; i++){\\n\\t\\tif(wordlist[i][maxPos]===maxAlp) return wordlist[i];\\n\\t}\\n}\\nfunction diff(a,b){\\n\\tlet count = 0;\\n\\tfor(let i=0; i<a.length; i++){\\n\\t\\tif(a[i]!==b[i]) count++;\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn count;\\n}\\n```",

If it\\'s not then lets filter for words that only have the same number of matches as the informed by \"guess\", as that is the exact value we have in common with the current word.\\n- When eliminating, lets excahnge the impossible word with the last valid word in the array, and reduce the index to not include the switched word.\\n  - This ends up creating a pseudo randomization, as at the end of every iteration many words changed place due to the \"randomization\" of the invalid words being exchanged.\\n- At the end of the iteration we eliminate the first word by the same process as the oders (exchanging it by the last valid word and decreasing the \"last\" index)\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/4f6d43c8-a3f7-4979-80ed-2d63aa4ac8a3_1672871768.9160514.png)\\n\\nNote: One of the things that make this so fast is that we are not creating objects (**O(1)**), only switching the position of the existing.

                "content": "The approach is, for each guess, take a word from the word list and use it to guess. If we get 6 matches, we are done. If not, we iterate the rest of the words in the word list and remove words that don\\'t have a similar number of matches. For example, if the guess word is `ccbazz` and the secret word is `acckzz`, `master.guess(\"ccbazz\")` will return 3, then I iterate the array to find words that compared to the guess word (`ccbazz`) have a match of 3, removing the rest.\\n\\nTo make the removal easy, we first convert the array to a hash set, and make use of an `Iterator` to remove while iterating (remember that there will be a concurrent exception if you try to remove an item from a collection while iterating on it). Why not a list? It could also work, but there is no use for the indexes. Besides, removal of a hash set is `O(1)`, which may differ on a list depending on the implementation.\\n\\nFor choosing the guess word, it doesn\\'t really matter, as there is no additional information that we can use to make a \"smart\" choice, so either a random pick or, in the case of this solution, the first word from the iterator.\\n\\n```\\n/**\\n * // This is the Master\\'s API interface.\\n * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation\\n * interface Master {\\n *     public int guess(String word) {}\\n * }\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void findSecretWord(String[] wordlist, Master master) {\\n        Set<String> wordset = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(wordlist));\\n        int guesses = 0;\\n        while (!wordset.isEmpty() && guesses < 10) {\\n            Iterator<String> iterator = wordset.iterator();\\n            String guessWord = iterator.next();\\n            int matches = master.guess(guessWord);\\n            if (matches == 6) {\\n                return;\\n            }\\n            iterator.remove();\\n            while (iterator.hasNext()) {\\n                String word = iterator.next();\\n                if (!this.hasPartialMatch(guessWord, word, matches)) {\\n                    iterator.remove();\\n                }\\n            }\\n            guesses++;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    private boolean hasPartialMatch(String word1, String word2, int matches) {\\n        int count = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {\\n            if (word1.charAt(i) == word2.charAt(i)) {\\n                count++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return count == matches;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor time complexity, we iterate the word list on each guess, reducing the list on each iteration. Worst case is that we don\\'t remove any word from the list, which will make 10 iterations of the list. Since that is fixed, the complexity of the iteration is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of words in the word list. `hasPartialMatch()` also iterates each word, but we know the length is fixed to 6, so it doesn\\'t really add to the complexity.\\n\\nFor space complexity, we make use of a hash set to store the words for easy removal, so that gives us `O(n)`.",

                "content": "This solution revolves around keeping track of which strings in wordlist could still be the secret word, by modifying wordlist in place. Lots of room for unlucky guesses. It takes a few guesses even when wordlist.Length is 100.\\n\\nWe begin by declaring:\\n* pop, which will be used to keep track of how many words could still be the secret word,\\n* right, to keep track of the current guess\\'s similarity to the secret word,\\n* the current guess.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void FindSecretWord(string[] wordlist, Master master) {\\n        int pop = wordlist.Length;\\n        int right;\\n        string guess;\\n```\\npop begins as wordlist.Length, but will quickly be lowered to a small fraction of this. When iterating through wordlist, pop is used instead of wordlist.Length as an upper bound; effectively allowing us to lower the length of wordlist and remove strings as we differentiate them from the secret word.\\nAny string in wordlist beyond pop-1 is known to not be the secret word, and is never accessed.\\n```\\n        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\\n            guess = wordlist[0];\\n            right = master.Guess(guess);\\n            if (right == 6) {\\n                return;\\n            } else {\\n                wordlist[0] = wordlist[pop-1];\\n                pop--;\\n            }\\n```\\nThen we run through 10 guesses, in the form of a for loop. For all submission cases it does not reach the end of this loop.\\nThe first string in wordlist is the guess each time. We assign right to the number of similarities it has with the secret word. If it happens to be correct (e.g. right is 6) then we immediately return, as we have guessed the secret word. This becomes exponentially more likely with each guess, and in the worst case, ocurrs when we have elimentated all other possible words and pop is 1. If wordlist[0] is not the secret word, we remove it from our population of candidates, by copying the last candidate to its position and then removing the last candidate by decrementing pop.\\nNote: we copy wordlist[0] to a buffer string guess, because the value of wordlist[0] is erased if it isn\\'t the secret word.\\n```\\nfor (int j = 0; j < pop; j++) {\\n                if (Match(guess, wordlist[j]) != right) {\\n                    wordlist[j] = wordlist[pop-1];\\n                    pop--;\\n                    j--;\\n                }\\n            }\\n```\\nNow we iterate through the rest of the viable strings in wordlist, using another for loop up to pop-1. We check each remaining word for its number of matching characters with the guess using Match(). If the number of matching characters between wordlist[j] and guess isn\\'t the same as our int right (the number of matching characters between the secret word and guess), then it can\\'t be the secret word. In that case we replace it with the last string in the population, and remove the last string with pop--. We must also decrement j, because the string we just checked (wordlist[j]), as been changed, and we need to go back and check it again.\\nAs this iterates through the rest of the viable population of strings, it decreases pop by roughly a factor of 3. This is what lowers our space complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log(n)). It also serves as a space efficient way to differentiate all of the viable strings from the non-viable ones, just by modifying wordlist in-place.\\n\\n\\nFull Code:\\n\\n```\\n/**\\n * // This is the Master\\'s API interface.\\n * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation\\n * class Master {\\n *     public int Guess(string word);\\n * }\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void FindSecretWord(string[] wordlist, Master master) {\\n        int pop = wordlist.Length;\\n        int right;\\n        string guess;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\\n            guess = wordlist[0];\\n            right = master.Guess(guess);\\n            if (right == 6) {\\n                return;\\n            } else {\\n                wordlist[0] = wordlist[pop-1];\\n                pop--;\\n            }\\n            for (int j = 0; j < pop; j++) {\\n                if (Match(guess, wordlist[j]) != right) {\\n                    wordlist[j] = wordlist[pop-1];\\n                    pop--;\\n                    j--;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return;\\n        \\n    }\\n    \\n    private int Match(string guess, string word) {\\n        int n = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {\\n            if (guess[i] == word[i]) n++;\\n        }\\n        return n;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\nAs mentioned above, the worst-case scenario, wordlist[0] isn\\'t guessed until pop is 1, and all other strings have been proven to not be the secret word. However, it often takes less guesses than this. For example, in test case 2, it takes 5 guesses. The population of viable strings decreases as follows: 100, 14, 9, 3. Once there were  3 strings left, there was a 1/3 chance of wordlist[0] being correct, and it guessed it. This is fairly average luck, since it did not happen to get the 1/9 or 1/14 or 1/100 chance of being correct on an earlier guess. There is a 19% chance that it would have guessed the secret word earlier, and a 46% chance that it guessed the secret word in the number of guesses it did.\\n\\n* O(n log(n)) time complexity worst-case, where n is wordlist.Length. It must iterate through wordlist.Length, then a fraction of that, then a fraction of that, etc.\\n* O(1) space complexity. 5 int values (pop, right, i, j, n). and one buffer string, guess.",

                "content": "First of all, very fun problem. Way outside my comfort zone and a good learning experience.\\n\\nThis problem smelled to me of Mastermind, a puzzle game from the 70\\'s which has been adapted to multiple games (such as in my experience Mansions of Madness!). I am not an expert, so I decided to read a bit on [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) to establish some abtractions.\\n\\nYou can see in the Wikipedia article that the real Mastermind puzzle is quite difficult to solve (NP Complete proofs in Wiki) and as such there are a few conventional solutions in the article. I made the following conceptual abstractions:\\n\\n1. Code guesses in Mastermind are equivalent to secret word guesses in this problem\\n2. Each guess will remove a number of candidates (pruning)\\n3. The mastermind is constrained to inform you how many matches you have between the code and the guess\\n\\nThe 3rd concept is powerful. Assuming *k* is the result of the guess (i.e. master.guess(word)), and *guess* is the word provided to the mastermind:\\n\\n1. Any candidates sharing less than*k* common letters with the *guess* can be removed\\n2. IFF *k* is zero, then all candidates sharing a common index/value pair with *guess* can be removed.\\n\\nNow, how do we pick the next best candidate? I am not an expert but Wikipedia (and Donald Knuth) suggests Minimax. In this problem our worst case scenario is simply running out guesses. We know that each choice will prune our candidate pool, however, maximizing the number of candidates pruned is the challenge. I attempted a few approaches and have valid solutions:\\n\\n 1. Get Lucky Frequently: 0ms avg., at most 10 guesses (non-deterministic).\\n 2. Greedily choose word with highest commonality: 0-4ms avg. at most 8 guesses.\\n\\nI do believe there is a better approach than the ones I implemented and I\\'d love to see them, however, leetcode is only judging by execution speed and memory size, not so much minimum guesses.

                "content": "My approach is simple. I pick a random word from ```wordlist```, then, find how many characters match with secret word. If there ```0 matches```, then ```we eliminate all strings which have even 1 character matching with currently picked word.``` If it has a matching count < 6, then ```we pick only those strings which have exactly the same matching characters in same position from wordlist```. \\n\\nThus, with each call to ```guess API```, we ```reduce our set of possibilities by eliminating the obvious strings which can\\'t be secret```.\\n\\nWhy do we pick ```random``` word instead of ```first word``` from ```wordlist``` everytime? The last 2 test-cases on this problem are arranged in such a way that if you always pick first element, it takes more than 10 guesses to reach to secret as the only possibility. Using a ```random``` word everytime distributes this probability and makes the failure chance 1/1000. It can still fail in rare cases where we always pick such a element at random that we eliminate very few possibilities. If we always make worse choice at ```random```, it will cause us to use more than 10 guesses. However, we probably can make an argument at ```on average```, this randomized approach will work. \\n\\n```\\n/**\\n * // This is the Master\\'s API interface.\\n * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation\\n * interface Master {\\n *     public int guess(String word) {}\\n * }\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void findSecretWord(String[] wordlist, Master master) {\\n        List<String> words = new ArrayList<>();\\n        for (String word : wordlist) {\\n            words.add(word);\\n        }\\n        \\n        Random random = new Random();\\n        \\n        while (!words.isEmpty()) {\\n            String guessWord = words.get(random.nextInt(words.size()));            \\n            int matchingCharCount = master.guess(guessWord);\\n            \\n            if (matchingCharCount == 6) {\\n                return;\\n            }\\n            \\n            if (matchingCharCount == 0) {\\n                // Remove all strings which have atleast 1 matching character with this guessWord\\n                // since they can\\'t be the secret.

                "content": "### Explanation\\nThe main idea is around continuously decreasing the `wordlist` to only contain words that would give us better or at least the same number of matches as our previous guesses.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s consider this input:\\n```\\nsecret: \"apples\"\\nwordlist: [\"aprons\", \"design\", \"apples\", \"apexes\", \"aprils\"]\\n```\\n\\n##### Scenario 1\\n1. We select a random word from our wordlist. Let\\'s say we get \"aprons\".\\n2. We guess this word and `master.guess()` returns 3 because there are 3 matches between \"**ap**ron**s**\" and \"**ap**ple**s**\".\\n3. We then check if we have found the secret word, which would be when we get 6 matches (because the length of each word is 6). If so, we break out of the while loop and have successfully completed the task.\\n4. If we didn\\'t get 6 matches, now we need to filter out the remaining words in our `wordlist`.\\n\\nFilter Function\\nThe filter function will loop through each word in `wordlist` and determine how many character matches there are between the word and the previous word we guessed.\\n\\nFor \"aprons\", the results would be the following:\\n- aprons: 6,\\n- design: 1,\\n- apples: 3,\\n- apexes: 3,\\n- aprils: 4\\n\\nNow we think about what those character match counts mean. \\n- The first word \"aprons\" has a character match of 6 with \"aprons\" and this was the word we originally guessed. We know for sure this is not our secret because we just guessed it and we did not get 6 matches!\\n- The second word \"design\" has a character match of 0 with \"aprons\". This cannot be our secret, because if it was our secret, we would have gotten 3 character matches like we did when we called `master.guess()`. \\n- The third word \"apples\" has a character match of 3 with \"aprons\". This means that it COULD be our secret word. Therefore, we add it to our newWordlist because it is a potential secret word!\\n- The fourth word \"apexes\" has a character match of 3 with \"aprons\". This means that it COULD be our secret word. Therefore, we add it to our newWordlist because it is a potential secret word!\\n- The fifth word \"aprils\" has a character match of 4 with \"aprons\". Therefore, like in the case of \"design\", there is no way this is our secret word.\\n\\nThen we continue guessing on the new wordlist consisting of `[\"apples\", \"apexes\"]` and filtering out words until we find a word that matches the secret.\\n\\n##### Scenario 2\\nNow let\\'s consider another scenario where our random word from the wordlist has -1 matches with the secret.\\n1. We select a random word from our wordlist. Let\\'s say we get \"design\".\\n2. We guess this word and `master.guess()` returns -1 because there are no matches between \"design\" and \"apples\".\\n3. We then check if we have found the secret word, which we have not because we have no character matches with the secret!\\n4. Now we need to filter out the remaining words in our `wordlist`.\\n\\nFilter Function\\nFor \"design\", the results would be the following:\\n- aprons: 0,\\n- design: 6,\\n- apples: 0,\\n- apexes: 0,\\n- aprils: 1\\n\\nNow we think about what those character match counts mean. \\n- The first, third, and fourth words \"aprons\", \"apples\", and \"apexes\" all have character matches of 0 with \"design\". Because they have no matches with \"design\", this means that they COULD have at least 1 match with the secret word. Therefore, we want to keep these words and we add them to our wordlist. \\n- The second word \"design\" has a character match of 6 with \"design\" and this was the word we originally guessed. We know for sure this is not our secret because we just guessed it and we did not get 6 matches! \\n- The fifth word \"aprils\" has a character match of 1 with \"design\". Because it matches \"design\" in 1 location, it definitely cannot be the secret word so we filter it out.\\n\\nTherefore, in the case where our guess returns -1, we only want to continue searching on words that had 0 matches with our guess.\\n\\n### Solution\\n```\\n/**\\n * @param {string[]} wordlist\\n * @param {Master} master\\n * @return {void}\\n */\\nvar findSecretWord = function(wordlist, master) {\\n  // Repeat 10 times\\n  let i = 0;\\n  while (i < 10) {\\n    // Select random word from list\\n    const guess = randomWord(wordlist);\\n    // \"Guess\" it\\n    const matches = master.guess(guess);\\n    // Terminate early if successfully guessed secret\\n    if (matches === 6) {\\n      break;\\n    }\\n    // Filter out remaining words based on matches (we are updating the original wordlist)\\n    wordlist = filter(guess, matches, wordlist);\\n    i++;\\n  }\\n};\\n\\nvar randomWord = function(wordlist) {\\n  return wordlist[Math.floor(Math.random() * wordlist.length)];\\n}\\n\\nvar filter = function(guess, matches, wordlist) {\\n  const newWordlist = [];\\n  for (let word of wordlist) {\\n    let count = 0; // to count number of matches between \\'word\\' and \\'guess\\'\\n    for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {\\n      if (word[i] === guess[i]) {\\n        count++;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    if (count === matches || (matches === -1 && count === 0)) {\\n\\t  newWordlist.push(word);\\n    }\\n  }\\n  return newWordlist;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTime: 44 ms, beats 99.36% of all JavaScript solutions\\nMemory: 34 MB, beats 100.00% of all JavaScript solutions\\n\\n",

                "content": "Randomly picking a word to guess will not always give you a pass in Approach 1. For a 6-letter word, from 0 matching to 6 matching with the secret word, they have different possibilities. 0 matching will have a possibility of (25/26)^6, which is about 79%. If you randomly pick a word with a non-zero guess, you eliminate 79% of the candidates, but if you randomly pick a word with a zero guess, you only eliminate 21% of the candidates and have a higher chance of being stuck in zero guesses for a while. This is for a generic random test case and might be true though for a special test case.\\n\\nThus, the trick in Approach 2 is really to use some sort of a score system to help pick a word with a higher chance to get a non-zero guess. One potential way is to compare each word with other words and let the matching score be the total number of matchings the word with other words. Sort the candidates with the score and get the first element with the highest score to guess. This will be problematic for this type of situation of abcdcd, adeded, bedada, bcdacb, zzzzzz with a secret word of zzzzzz of the lowest matching score.\\n\\nI actually intermittenly get the first and last elememt from the candidate list to try the highest-score element and lowest-score element.

Naive Solution**:\\nWe have at most 10 trials of guesses; at first, we will randomly choose a word to guess. \\n[Why random choose? Because the secret word could be in later part of wordlist, random sample will give us the possibility of 1/len(wordlist) for getting secret word]\\nThen, we use the selected word (`guess`) to `master.guess`, and get mathced number (`match_number`).\\nIn the end, update `wordlist` to be a list that each word only has the same `match_number` with `guess`.\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findSecretWord(self, wordlist: List[str], master: \\'Master\\') -> None:\\n        for _ in range(10):\\n            guess = random.choice(wordlist)\\n            match_number = master.guess(guess)\\n            wordlist = [word for word in wordlist if sum([c1 == c2 for c1, c2 in zip(guess, word)]) == match_number]\\n```\\n**Complexity**: Time O(N), Space O(N).\\n\\nHowever, this doesn\\'t gurantee 10 trails will definitely find the secret word.

Code below is used to get this probability in python\\n```\\n    def probOfMatchN(n):\\n        def nCr(n, r):\\n            f = factorial\\n            return f(n) / f(r) / f(n - r)\\n        return nCr(6, n) * ((1/26) ** n) * ((25/26) ** (6 - n))\\n```\\n\\nAfter we get the expectations, we can write a function that takes word candidates as input and the best word to guess as output:\\n```\\n    def exactMatch(self, s1, s2):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif (s1, s2) not in self.memo:\\n            self.memo[(s1, s2)] = sum(s1[i] == s2[i] for i in range(len(s1)))\\n        return self.memo[(s1, s2)]\\n\\n    def findFirst(self, words):\\n        expectation = [0] * len(words)\\n        for k, prob in enumerate(self.probs):\\n            for i, w1 in enumerate(words):\\n                for j, w2 in enumerate(words[i + 1:]):\\n                    if self.exactMatch(w1, w2) != k:\\n                        expectation[i] += prob\\n                        expectation[i + 1 + j] += prob\\n        return expectation.index(max(expectation))\\n```\\n\\n**For instance**, if `word = [\"112\", \"221\", \"212\", \"cba\", \"abc\"]`, then the expectations is `[1.61, 1.44, 2.21, 1.44, 1.44]`, thus we take `\"212\"` as guess input **because \"212\" is expected to exclude `2.21` words not including itself from the word list**\\n \\n\\nIn addition, the probability of different numbers of overlaping is independent for words, which means we can get and store the probability in advance and hardcode it in our solution:\\n```\\nprobs = [0.79, 0.19, 0.019, 0.001, 0.0003, 0.0005]\\n```\\n\\nWe can also just use one probability to do the guess(always assume the guess has 0 machtes) to speed up the algorithm.(also Accepted)\\n```\\nprobs = [0.79]\\n```\\n\\n\\nThe complete code (**including the Master class for debuging purpose**) is here:\\n```\\nclass Master:\\n\\n    def __init__(self, key):\\n        self.key = key\\n\\n    def guess(self, s1):\\n        return sum(s1[i] == s2[i] for i in range(len(s1)))\\n\\nfrom math import factorial\\nclass Solution:\\n\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.memo = {}\\n        self.probs = [0.79, 0.19, 0.019, 0.001, 0.0003, 0.0005]\\n\\n    def exactMatch(self, s1, s2):\\n         if (s1, s2) not in self.memo:\\n            self.memo[(s1, s2)] = sum(s1[i] == s2[i] for i in range(len(s1)))\\n        return self.memo[(s1, s2)]\\n\\n    def findFirst(self, words):\\n        expectation = [0] * len(words)\\n        for k, prob in enumerate(self.probs):\\n            for i, w1 in enumerate(words):\\n                for j, w2 in enumerate(words[i + 1:]):\\n                    if self.exactMatch(w1, w2) != k:\\n                        expectation[i] += prob\\n                        expectation[i + 1 + j] += prob\\n        return expectation.index(max(expectation))\\n\\n    def findSecretWord(self, wordlist, master):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type wordlist: List[Str]\\n        :type master: Master\\n        :rtype: None\\n        \"\"\"\\n        check = wordlist.copy()\\n        while check:\\n            _check = []\\n            lookup = self.findFirst(check)\\n            sample = check[lookup]\\n            del check[lookup]\\n            overlap = master.guess(sample)\\n            if overlap == 0: # no single common letter\\n                for s in check:\\n                    if not self.exactMatch(s, sample):\\n                        _check.append(s)\\n            elif overlap == len(sample): # found\\n                return sample\\n            else: # partly matched\\n                for s in check:\\n                    if self.exactMatch(s, sample) == overlap:\\n                        _check.append(s)\\n        return -1\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

                "content": "While looking at questions, try to understand why various aspects of the question are given. For eg, i solved the problem in following steps:\\n[1] suppose the wordlist only contains a \\'single word\\', i.e. secret. You cannot access this word list. All you can do is bruteforce a single 6 lettered word, until it matches the secret. \\nGiven these constraints, what is the minimum no of moves you need to make to solve the problem?\\n\\nTo calculate these moves, i started off with a dp solution in mind. Suppose, a string is obtained, s.t. 5 characters of it match, and 1 character does not match. \\nFor eg, \\nsuppose guessed word is abcdez\\nsecret is abcdez, how do we reach the correct word, abcdef from acbdez. \\nHere, as you can see the match api, would return 5 (since abcde) match.\\nWhat is the minimum no of operations you wanna need in this case?\\nTo solve this, you need to find answer to two things:\\n[1] What is the exact \\'character\\' in the guessed word which presents an error. so, for our guess,(abcdez), the character \\'z\\' is the culprit. We need to find this position (i.e. sixth letter) and make it a \\'f\\'. So, suppose we manage to find this 6th position. And want to convert it from \\'z\\' to \\'f\\'. How can we do that? The worst case is to bruterforce from z,a,b,c,...... till we reach characters. Hence, it shall take minimum 24 operations to get this particular letter. \\n[2] As soon as it became clear, it hit me. i.e. asking to find the secret in less than 10 moves must be far fetched. So,next i tried to think in terms of graphs. \\nImagine a six lettered word which represents a secret. Then, at the next graph level would lie \\'all the words\\' whose 5 characters match. Finally, at the fifth level there would be words whose \\'none of the characters match\\'. What i needed then, was to search for a way to start from the fifth level and converge towards the initial level i.e. the word of six perfect matches [i.e. the secret word]. However, moving backward in the graph is generally impossible unless you possess parent pointers. \\n\\nThis is where, the approach of matching words became clear.\\nSuppose your guessed word is of the form XX- - - - , where X denotes the \\'perfectly matching word\\'. Then, a candidate word, whose 3 characters match, must be of the form XX-Y-- i.e. XX of previous word should match, and Y can be anything. So, this is the criteria i used for filtering the words. \\nThis beats 100% of the solutions here. \\n```\\n# \"\"\"\\n# This is Master\\'s API interface.\\n# You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation\\n# \"\"\"\\n# class Master:\\n#     def guess(self, word: str) -> int:\\nimport random \\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    def no_of_matches(self,word1, word2):\\n        #checking the number of matches \\n        matches = 0\\n        for i in range(6):\\n            if word1[i]==word2[i]: matches+=1\\n        return matches\\n    \\n    #you only wanna call the function on the words which retain at least the number of matches with the current word in the wordlist\\n    def findSecretWord(self, wordlist: List[str], master: \\'Master\\') -> None:\\n        \\n        #get the no of trials you can call the secret for \\n        n_trials =10\\n        #shuffling once is fine \\n        random.shuffle(wordlist)\\n        for i in range(n_trials):\\n            #shuffle the wordlist \\n            #choose intial elements \\n            if wordlist!=[]:\\n                n_matches = master.guess(wordlist[0])\\n\\n            #create a new wordlist, who match \\'at least\\', the characters in this guy \\n            new_wordlist = []\\n            for word in wordlist[1:]:\\n                #compute matchds \\n                curr_matches = self.no_of_matches(word,wordlist[0])\\n                if curr_matches ==n_matches:\\n                    #keep that word in the new wordlist \\n                    new_wordlist.append(word)\\n            #reinitialize the wordlist \\n            wordlist = new_wordlist\\n```\\n",

Pruning. #1 does not even use the number of matches returned from guess. We can use it to prune the wordlist.\\n```\\n\\tpublic void findSecretWord(String[] wordlist, Master master) {\\n        int n=wordlist.length;\\n        boolean[] excl=new boolean[n]; \\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {\\n            if(excl[i]) continue;\\n            int match=master.guess(wordlist[i]);\\n            for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++) {\\n                if(matches(wordlist[i],wordlist[j])!=match) \\n                    excl[j]=true;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    private int matches(String s1, String s2) {\\n        int match=0;\\n        for(int i=0;i<s1.length();i++)\\n            if(s1.charAt(i)==s2.charAt(i))\\n                match++;\\n        return match;\\n    }\\n```\\n3. Math. In #2, we always pick the first un-deleted word to guess. For two random words, the probability that they have 0 matches is (25/26)^6 = 79%. So we get 0 from guess most of the time and the guess word has 0 matches with most words. This means we only eleminate few words after each guess. No matter how we pick the word, guess will always return 0. Thus we can pick a word that has the fewest zero matches with the list so that we can filter max number of words.\\n```\\n\\tprivate int LEN = 6;\\n    public void findSecretWord(String[] wordlist, Master master) {\\n        int matches = 0;\\n        List<String> words = Arrays.asList(wordlist);\\n        while(matches !=LEN) {\\n            String guess = pickWord(words);\\n            matches = master.guess(guess);\\n            if(matches == LEN) {\\n                return;\\n            }\\n            words = elimination(matches, guess, words);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    private String pickWord(List<String> words) {\\n        int n = words.size(), max=0, index=0;\\n        int[] count = new int[n];\\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {\\n            String si = words.get(i);\\n            for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++) {\\n                if(matches(si, words.get(j))>0) {\\n                    count[i]++;\\n                    count[j]++;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            if(count[i]>max) {\\n                max = count[i];\\n                index = i;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return words.get(index);\\n    }\\n    private List<String> elimination(int matches, String guess, List<String> words) {\\n        List<String> pruned = new ArrayList<>();\\n        for(String word:words) {\\n            if(matches(word, guess)==matches) {\\n                pruned.add(word);\\n            }    \\n        }\\n        return pruned;\\n    }\\n```",

Therefore, if we select one common point (say, the first one) and compare the slopes of lines created by every point with this one, they should all be equal. Recall from Algebra that slope is calculated by ```(y1-y0) / (x1-x0)```, or the change in y (dy, or rise) divided by the change in x (dx, or run). If you\\'ve seen other discussion solutions, you may have seen something like this:\\n```\\n# initial naive approach comparing slopes\\ndef checkStraightLine(self, coordinates: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\\n    x0, y0 = coordinates[0]\\n    x1, y1 = coordinates[1]\\n    dy = y1 - y0\\n    dx = x1 - x0\\n    m = dy / dx   # m is the slope, as in the slope-intercept form of a line, y = mx + b\\n\\n    for x, y in coordinates:\\n        if (y - y0) / (x - x0) != m:\\n            return False\\n    else:\\n        return True\\n```\\n## But Wait, What About Vertical Lines?\\nI\\'m sure you\\'re screaming \"Hey! That won\\'t work if any of your points lie on the same vertical line! You\\'ll get a divide by zero error!\" And you\\'d be absolutely correct. So we should check that ```dx != 0```. And also that ```x - x0 != 0```. But what if **all** the points are on the same vertical line? Then we should have another ```for``` loop that checks that all the x-coordinates are the same as the first one. While we\\'re at it, might as well do one for the y-coordinates too (it\\'ll run slightly faster if they\\'re on the same horizontal line!). Yikes, this is getting complicated.\\n## There\\'s a Better Way\\nLet\\'s use some *math* to simplify our equation so that we\\'re not worrying about dividing by zero. In our original code, we need to compare the original slope ```(y1-y0) / (x1-x0)``` with each subsequent slope ```(yi-y0) / xi-x0)``` for equality. To simplify things, since the original slope remains constant, let\\'s define ```dy = y1-y0``` and ```dx = x1-x0```. \\n```\\ndy     yi-y0\\n--  =  -----\\ndx     xi-x0\\n```\\nCross-multiply and move all the constant terms to one side to get:\\n```\\ndx*yi - dy*xi = dx*y0 - dy*x0\\n```\\n***Note**: This same equation can also be derived if you take the **cross product** of the vectors formed by AB and AC, where A is the first point, B is the second point, and C is each subsequent point, and set it to zero, since the cross product of two colinear vectors is zero. This is why I\\'ve used the name ```xp``` for the constant term on on the right side of the equation.*\\nFinally, setting ```xp = dx*y0 - dy*x0```, we can iterate through each subsequent point and check that the left side ```dx*yi - dy*xi``` is equal to our ```xp``` term. This avoids any divison by zero, and provides an elegant solution to the problem.\\n",

                "content": "Hello **Tenno Leetcoders**, \\r\\n\\r\\nFor this problem, we are given an array coordinates, `coordinates[i] = [x, y]`, where `[x, y]` represents the coordinate of a point. Check if these points make a straight line in the `XY` plane.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Explanation \\r\\n\\r\\nThis problem, ask use to check if points on the like create a straight line. To help us, we can use a modified `slope formula` denoted as `(y2 - y1) * (x - x1) - (y - y1) * (x2 - x1)` to help us check the points on the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe first check if the number of coordinates is less than or equal to `2` as any two points on the line will always lie on a straight line so we return `true/True`\\r\\n\\r\\nCreate a helper function called `calculate_slope` to help us determine if points are `collinear` of our `2x2` matrix form by the coordinates of `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` with `x` and `y` using the concept of `cross product` to help determine `collinearity`. IFF the points lie one the same straight line, the determinant will be `0` \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cross production calculation denoted as `(y2 - y1) * (x - x1) - (y - y1) * (x2 - x1)`, represents the signed area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)` and from `(x1, y1)` to `(x, y)`. The sign of the determinant determines the orientation of the points. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the determinant is `0`, this means the points are `collinear`, which will lie on a straight line. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf determinant is a `non-zero`, this means the points are `not collinear`\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\nNow, we can calculate the initial slope between the first two points:\\r\\n\\r\\n    - Assign the first set of coordinates to x1, y1\\r\\n    \\r\\n    - Assign the second set of coordinates to x2, y2\\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\nSince we initialized the first two points, we will traverse starting from the third set of the coordinate until the final coordinate. For each iteration, assign the current set of coordinates to `(x, y)`. We then calculate the slope using `calculateSlope`, checking if it equals to `0`.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf slope does not equal to `0` for any set of three consecutive points, it indicates that the points do not lie on the same straight line. so we return `false / False` else it will be `true/True`\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n# Code\\r\\n\\r\\n**Python**\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nclass Solution:\\r\\n    def checkStraightLine(self, coordinates: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\\r\\n        coord_len = len(coordinates) \\r\\n\\r\\n        if coord_len <= 2:\\r\\n            return True\\r\\n\\r\\n        def calculate_slope(x1, y1, x2, y2, x, y):\\r\\n            return (y2 - y1) * (x - x1) - (y - y1) * (x2 - x1)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n        x1, y1 = coordinates[0]\\r\\n        x2, y2 = coordinates[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n        for i in range(2, coord_len):\\r\\n            x, y = coordinates[i]\\r\\n\\r\\n            if calculate_slope(x1, y1, x2, y2, x, y) != 0:\\r\\n                return False\\r\\n\\r\\n        return True\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**JavaScript**\\r\\n```\\r\\n/**\\r\\n * @param {number[][]} coordinates\\r\\n * @return {boolean}\\r\\n */\\r\\nvar checkStraightLine = function(coordinates) {\\r\\n    coordLen = coordinates.length\\r\\n\\r\\n    if(coordLen <= 2) return true\\r\\n\\r\\n    function calculateSlope(x1, y1, x2, y2, x, y) {\\r\\n    return (y2 - y1) * (x - x1) - (y - y1) * (x2 - x1);\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n    let [x1, y1] = coordinates[0]\\r\\n    let [x2, y2] = coordinates[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n   for (let i = 2; i < coordinates.length; i++) {\\r\\n    let [x, y] = coordinates[i];\\r\\n    if (calculateSlope(x1, y1, x2, y2, x, y) !== 0) {\\r\\n      return false;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  return true;\\r\\n};\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Time Complexity: O(n)\\r\\n### Space Complexity: O(n)\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n***Warframe\\'s Darvo wants you to upvote this post  \\uD83D\\uDE4F\\uD83C\\uDFFB \\u2764\\uFE0F\\u200D\\uD83D\\uDD25***\\r\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/814f5668-c966-46d7-ba42-e5435c4c1761_1675302761.3081913.gif)",

So what should we do ?\\n\\nFor this lets consider coordinates of three points (x0,y0), (x1,y1) and (i,j). Now if calculate the slope for these coordinates then it would be\\n**slope = (y1-y0)/(x1-x0) \\nAnd slope = (j-y0)/(i-x0)**\\n\\nFrom this we can say that (y1-y0)/(x1-x0) = (j-y0)/(i-x0)\\nsimilary we can say that\\n**(y1-y0)*(i-x0) = (j-y0)*(x1-x0)**\\nAnd this is true for all coordinates which lie on a stright line. Now the only thing left is to loop this condition to check across all the coordinates.\\n\\nAlso I have checked that if there are less than 2 elements in coordinates array then assume they are on straight line.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n) loop acroos the coordinates\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1) because constant space is required for coordinates\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def checkStraightLine(self, coordinates):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type coordinates: List[List[int]]\\n        :rtype: bool\\n        \"\"\"\\n        if len(coordinates)<3:\\n            return True\\n        \\n        (x0,y0),(x1,y1)=coordinates[:2]\\n\\n        for i,j in coordinates:\\n            if (y1-y0)*(i-x0)!=(j-y0)*(x1-x0):\\n                return False\\n        return True\\n```",

If x0==x1 for the first two points, we have a vertical line, and our line equation becomes ( x = x0 ).\\n\\n3. We build an auxiliary function called \"inline\", which checks if points belong to our line equation.\\n\\n4. We apply our function \"inline\" to all coordinate pairs, and return \"True\" if all points pass the check (otherwise False).\\n\\nI hope the explanation was helpful. I have used this algorithm plenty of times at work :)\\nCheers,\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def checkStraightLine(self, P):\\n        x0,y0 = P[0]\\n        x1,y1 = P[1]\\n        #\\n        if x0==x1:\\n            inline = lambda x,y: x==x0\\n        else:\\n            # y = m*x + b\\n            m = ( y1 - y0 )/float( x1 - x0 )\\n            b = y0 - m*x0\\n            inline = lambda x,y: y == ( m*x + b )\\n        #\\n        return all( [ inline(x,y) for x,y in P[2:] ] )\\n```",

Calculate the slope between the first two points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) using the formula (y1 - y0) / (x1 - x0).\\r\\n1. Iterate through the remaining points starting from index 2.\\r\\n1. For each point (x, y), calculate the slope between (x, y) and (x0, y0).\\r\\n1. If the calculated slope is not equal to the slope between the first two points, return false.\\r\\n1.

What is a slope, it is a quotient between x distance and y distance of two points, it called dx and dy. First calculate slope between first two points, and than compare slope between first point and rest of them with first slope. \\n\\nIt is may happens that dy or dx are the same because it is horizontal or vertical line, and y and x values are same between all points respectively.

I wonder how many other programmers had to revise their algorithms several times as new test cases failed.\n\nSome high school algebra: the slope of a line through any 2 points is \nm = (y0 - y1) / (x0 - x1) = (y1 - y2) / (x1 - x2). Of course, it could be that xi = xj so this can't be used directly. However, we can cross multiply:\n(y0 - y1) * (x1 - x2) = (y1 - y2)  * (x0 - x1) will be true if the 3 points are collinear.\n\nSo go with the test: ``(y[i] - y[i+1]) * (x[i+1] - x[i+2]) == (y[i+1] - y[i+2]) * (x[i] - x[i+1])``\n"
