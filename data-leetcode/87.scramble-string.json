                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe problem is asking to check whether s2 is scrambled string of s1 or not. The scrambled string of a given string is defined as any string that can be obtained by swapping some characters of the original string. So we can solve this problem recursively by dividing the string into left and right substrings and check for two cases i.e., whether we need to swap the substrings before checking for the next recursive call or not.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nWe will first check the base cases i.e., if the two strings are equal or not or if they are of different sizes. Then, we will create a key for the current problem by concatenating the two strings and storing it in a dictionary to avoid repeated computations. We will iterate over all possible splits of the current string and check whether we need to swap the left and right substrings or not. We will then make recursive calls on these two substrings and return true if any of the calls return true.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n^4)$$ \\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nsince for each character in s1, we are trying out all possible splits of the string which takes $$O(n^2)$$ time and we are calling the recursion twice for each split which takes another $$O(n^2)$$ time. And for each such problem, we are storing it in a dictionary which takes $$O(1)$$ time. So overall time complexity is $$O(n^4)$$.\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(n^3)$$ \\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nsince we are using a dictionary to store previously solved problems and the depth of the recursion tree can go up to n. Therefore, the space complexity of this solution is $$O(n^3)$$.\\n\\n\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b427e686-2e5d-469a-8e7a-db5140022a6b_1677715904.0948765.png)\\n\\n\\n# Please Upvote\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\n```\\nThanks for visiting my solution.\\uD83D\\uDE0A Keep Learning\\nPlease give my solution an upvote! \\uD83D\\uDC4D\\nIt\\'s a simple way to show your appreciation and\\nkeep me motivated.

The idea is to recursively check all possible splits of the two strings, and memoize the results to avoid recomputing the same substrings multiple times.\\n##### \\u2022\\tDynamic programming: This approach involves building a 3D table to store the results of all possible substrings of the two strings. The table is filled in a bottom-up manner, starting with the smallest substrings and building up to the largest substrings. The table can then be used to check if the two strings are scrambled versions of each other.\\n##### \\u2022\\tTop-down dynamic programming: This approach is similar to recursion with memoization, but uses a 3D table to store the results of all possible substrings of the two strings. The table is filled in a top-down manner, starting with the largest substrings and building down to the smallest substrings. The table can then be used to check if the two strings are scrambled versions of each other.\\n##### \\u2022\\tBFS: This approach involves using a queue to generate all possible scrambled versions of one of the strings, and checking if any of them match the other string. The idea is to generate all possible substrings of the first string, and then generate all possible permutations of each substring. The resulting strings can then be checked to see if they match the second string.\\n##### \\u2022\\tAll of these approaches have the same time and space complexity of O(n^4), but they differ in their implementation details and performance characteristics.\\n\\n# Intuition &  Approach\\n\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n##### \\u2022\\tThe problem is to determine if two strings s1 and s2 are scrambled versions of each other. The algorithm works by recursively splitting the strings into two non-empty substrings and swapping them randomly. The algorithm stops when the length of the string is 1.\\n##### \\u2022\\tThe approach used to solve the problem use a recursive function that checks if the two strings are scrambled versions of each other. The function checks if the two strings are equal, and if not, it checks if the two strings have the same characters and if the substrings of the two strings are scrambled versions of each other.\\n##### \\u2022\\tThe algorithm uses an unordered map to store the results of previously computed substrings to avoid recomputing them. It also uses three vectors to keep track of the frequency of characters in the two strings and the current substring being checked.\\n##### \\u2022\\tThe intuition behind the algorithm is that if two strings are scrambled versions of each other, then they can be split into two non-empty substrings that are also scrambled versions of each other. The algorithm checks all possible splits of the two strings and recursively checks if the substrings are scrambled versions of each other.\\n##### \\u2022\\tThe algorithm starts by checking if the two strings are equal. If they are, it returns true. If not, it initializes three vectors to keep track of the frequency of characters in the two strings and the current substring being checked. It then checks if the current substring of s1 and s2 have the same characters. If they do, it recursively checks if the substrings of s1 and s2 are scrambled versions of each other. If they are, it returns true.\\n##### \\u2022\\tIf the current substrings of s1 and s2 do not have the same characters, the algorithm checks all possible splits of the two strings. For each split, it checks if the substrings of s1 and s2 are scrambled versions of each other. If they are, it returns true.\\n##### \\u2022\\tThe algorithm uses an unordered map to store the results of previously computed substrings to avoid recomputing them. If the current substring of s1 and s2 has already been computed, the algorithm returns the stored result.\\n##### \\u2022\\tOverall, the algorithm uses a recursive approach to check if two strings are scrambled versions of each other.

This is because the algorithm checks all possible splits of the two strings, which takes O(n^2) time, and for each split, it recursively checks if the substrings are scrambled versions of each other, which takes O(n^2) time in the worst case. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2 * n^2) = O(n^4).\\n##### \\u2022\\tThe space complexity of the algorithm is also O(n^4), due to the use of the unordered map to store previously computed substrings. In the worst case, the map can store all possible substrings of the two strings, which takes O(n^4) space. Additionally, the algorithm uses three arrays to keep track of the frequency of characters in the two strings and the current substring being checked, which also takes O(n^3) space in the worst case. Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n^4).\\n##### \\u2022\\tHowever, the use of the unordered map to store previously computed substrings allows the algorithm to avoid recomputing the same substrings multiple times, which can significantly improve the performance of the algorithm for large inputs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# DP  Intuition\\n##### \\u2022\\tThe problem involves checking if two strings are scrambled versions of each other.\\n##### \\u2022\\tWe have a recursive definition of scrambling a string s, which involves dividing s into x and y, and scrambling x and y independently.\\n##### \\u2022\\tTo check if a given string t is a scrambled string of s, we choose an index and cut s into x and y, and see if we can cut t into scrambled versions of x and y.\\n##### \\u2022\\tWe can solve the problem using dynamic programming by defining a 3D table with variables for length, i, and j to represent the subproblems.\\n##### \\u2022\\tEach state focuses on two substrings: a substring of s1 starting at index i with length equal to length, and a substring of s2 starting at index j with length equal to length.\\n##### \\u2022\\tWe use a base case for substrings of length 1 and fill the table for substrings of length 2 to n.\\n##### \\u2022\\tAt each state, we perform a split on s1 and consider all possible splits, and write down the transitions for each case.\\n##### \\u2022\\tThe answer to the problem is dp[n][0][0], where n is the length of the input strings.\\n#\\tAlgorithm:\\n##### \\u2022\\tIterate i from 0 to n-1.\\n##### \\u2022\\tIterate j from 0 to n-1.\\n##### \\u2022\\tSet dp[1][i][j] to the boolean value of s1[i] == s2[j] (the base case of the DP).\\n##### \\u2022\\tIterate length from 2 to n.\\n##### \\u2022\\tIterate i from 0 to n + 1 - length.\\n##### \\u2022\\tIterate j from 0 to n + 1 - length.\\n##### \\u2022\\tIterate newLength from 1 to length - 1.\\n##### \\u2022\\tIf dp[newLength][i][j] && dp[length-newLength][i+newLength][j+newLength]) || (dp[newLength][i][j+l-newLength] && dp[l-newLength][i+newLength][j] is true, set dp[length][i][j] to true.\\n##### \\u2022\\tReturn dp[n][0][0].\\n\\n\\n\\n```PYTHON []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isScramble(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\\n        n = len(s1)\\n        # Initialize a 3D table to store the results of all possible substrings of the two strings\\n        dp = [[[False for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n+1)]\\n\\n        # Initialize the table for substrings of length 1\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            for j in range(n):\\n                dp[1][i][j] = s1[i] == s2[j]\\n\\n        # Fill the table for substrings of length 2 to n\\n        for length in range(2, n+1):\\n            for i in range(n+1-length):\\n                for j in range(n+1-length):\\n                    # Iterate over all possible lengths of the first substring\\n                    for newLength in range(1, length):\\n                        # Check if the two possible splits of the substrings are scrambled versions of each other\\n                        dp1 = dp[newLength][i]\\n                        dp2 = dp[length-newLength][i+newLength]\\n                        dp[length][i][j] |= dp1[j] and dp2[j+newLength]\\n                        dp[length][i][j] |= dp1[j+length-newLength] and dp2[j]\\n\\n        # Return whether the entire strings s1 and s2 are scrambled versions of each other\\n        return dp[n][0][0]\\n```\\n```JAVA []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean isScramble(String s1, String s2) {\\n        int n = s1.length();\\n        // Initialize a 3D table to store the results of all possible substrings of the two strings\\n        boolean[][][] dp = new boolean[n+1][n][n];\\n\\n        // Initialize the table for substrings of length 1\\n        for (int i = 0;

The value of isS[idx1 * sSize + idx2 + len * sSize * sSize] can be either 0 (not computed yet), 1 (valid scramble), or 2 (invalid scramble). \\n##### \\u2022\\tThe recursion is implemented in the DP_helper function, which takes as input the two strings s1 and s2 , the starting indices idx1 and idx2 , the length len , and the cache isS . \\n##### \\u2022\\tThe function first checks if the result for this substring pair has already been computed and cached, and returns the cached result if it exists. \\n##### \\u2022\\tOtherwise, it counts the frequency of each character in the two substrings, and returns false if the two substrings have different characters. If the length of the substrings is 1, the function returns true.\\n##### \\u2022\\tIf the two substrings have the same character set, the function recursively checks all possible split positions and returns true if any of them are valid scrambles of each other. \\n##### \\u2022\\tFinally, the function saves the intermediate result in the cache and returns the result. \\n##### \\u2022\\tTo optimize the recursion, the function uses early pruning by checking if the two substrings have the same character set before recursively checking all possible split positions. \\n##### \\u2022\\tIf the two substrings have different character sets, the function immediately returns false without doing any further computation. \\n##### \\u2022\\tThis helps to reduce the number of recursive calls and improve the overall performance of the algorithm.\\n\\n\\n# DRY RUN 1\\n\\n##### \\u2022\\tLet\\'s dry run the algorithm with the input \"great\" andrgeat\".\\n##### \\u2022\\tFirst, the algorithm checks if the two strings are equal.

The algorithm updates the frequency vectors for s1, s2, and the current substring, and checks if the current substring has the same characters. Since \"gr\" and \"rg\" have the same characters, the algorithm recursively checks if the substrings of s1 and s2 are scrambled versions of each other. It does this by calling the isScramble function with the substrings \"g\" and \"r\" for both s1 and s2. Since \"g\" and \"r\" are not scrambled versions of each other, the algorithm backtracks and checks the other possible split.\\n##### \\u2022\\tFor the third split, i = 3 and j = 2. The algorithm updates the frequency vectors for s1, s2, and the current substring, and checks if the current substring has the same characters. Since \"gre\" and \"rge\" have the same characters, the algorithm recursively checks if the substrings of s1 and s2 are scrambled versions of each other. It does this by calling the isScramble function with the substrings \"g\" and \"r\" for s1 and s2, and the substrings \"re\" and \"eat\" for s1 and s2. Since \"g\" and \"r\" are not scrambled versions of each other, the algorithm backtracks and checks the other possible split.\\n##### \\u2022\\tFor the fourth split, i = 4 and j = 1. The algorithm updates the frequency vectors for s1, s2, and the current substring, and checks if the current substring has the same characters. Since \"reat\" and \"rgea\" have the same characters, the algorithm recursively checks if the substrings of s1 and s2 are scrambled versions of each other. It does this by calling the  isScramble function with the substrings \"r\" and \"r\" for s1 and s2, and the substrings \"eat\" and \"gea\" for s1 and s2. Since \"r\" and \"r\" are scrambled versions of each other, the algorithm proceeds to check if \"eat\" and \"gea\" are scrambled versions of each other. It does this by calling the  isScramble function with the substrings \"e\" and \"e\" for s1 and s2, and the substrings \"at\" and \"ga\" for s1 and s2. Since \"e\" and \"e\" are scrambled versions of each other, the algorithm proceeds to check if \"at\" and \"ga\" are scrambled versions of each other. It does this by calling the  isScramble function with the substrings \"a\" and \"a\" for s1 and s2, and the substrings \"t\" and \"g\" for s1 and s2. Since \"a\" and \"a\" are scrambled versions of each other, and \"t\" and \"g\" are scrambled versions of each other, the algorithm returns true.\\n##### \\u2022\\tTherefore, the output of the algorithm for the input \"great\" and \"rgeat\" is true, indicating that the two strings are scrambled versions of each other.\\n\\n# DRY RUN 2\\n##### \\u2022\\tLet\\'s dry run the algorithm with the input \"abcde\" and \"caebd\".\\n##### \\u2022\\tFirst, the algorithm checks if the two strings are equal.

The memoization is achieved using a dictionary m that stores the result of previous computations for the same inputs.\\n\\nThe func function takes in two strings s1 and s2, and returns a boolean value indicating whether they are scrambled versions of each other. The function first checks the length of the strings - if they are both of length 1, it simply compares the characters. If the sorted characters in the two strings are not equal, it returns False.\\n\\nOtherwise, the function loops through all possible partitions of s1 and checks if they are valid scrambles of corresponding partitions in s2. The partitions are formed by looping through the length of s1 from index 1 to the end. If a valid partition is found, the function recursively checks the remaining partitions to see if they are also valid scrambles.\\n\\nIf at least one valid partition is found, the function returns True and stores the result in the m dictionary. If no valid partitions are found, the function returns False and stores the result in the m dictionary.\\n\\nFinally, the isScramble function calls the func function with the two input strings and returns the resulting boolean value.\\n# Please Upvote \\uD83D\\uDE07\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/a85197c0-ca4e-4b4b-9d0e-6c3e999491f0_1680140610.86559.png)\\n\\n\\n# Python3\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isScramble(self,s1, s2):\\n        m ={}\\n        def func(s1, s2):\\n            if (s1, s2) in m:\\n                return m[(s1, s2)]\\n            if not sorted(s1) == sorted(s2):\\n                return False\\n            if len(s1) == 1:\\n                return True\\n            \\n\\n            for i in range(1, len(s1)):\\n                if func(s1[:i], s2[-i:]) and func(s1[i:], s2[:-i]) or func(s1[:i], s2[:i]) and func(s1[i:], s2[i:]):\\n                    m[(s1, s2)] = True\\n                    return True\\n            m[(s1, s2)] = False\\n            return False\\n        return func(s1, s2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/a6c83c54-1d1a-4f26-8273-b687d119dd5b_1679889261.1494205.png)",

We can define a 3D boolean array dp[i][j][length] to represent whether s1[i:i+length] and s2[j:j+length] are scrambled versions of each other. The array dp will have dimensions n x n x (n+1), where n is the length of the strings. The base case is when length=1, and in this case, dp[i][j][1] is true if and only if s1[i] is equal to s2[j]. For each value of length, we can iterate through all possible starting indices i and j, and all possible split points k such that 1 <= k < length. We can then check if the substrings of s1 and s2 starting at indices i and j, respectively, and both of length k, are scrambled versions of each other, and if the substrings of s1 and s2 starting at indices i+k and j+k, respectively, and both of length length-k, are scrambled versions of each other. If either of these conditions are met, then dp[i][j][length] is true.\\n\\n# Intuition:\\n\\n- The intuition behind this approach is that if two strings s1 and s2 are scrambled versions of each other, then there must exist a split point k such that either the substrings of s1 and s2 starting at indices 0 and 0, respectively, and both of length k, are scrambled versions of each other, and the substrings of s1 and s2 starting at indices k and k, respectively, and both of length length-k, are scrambled versions of each other, or the substrings of s1 and s2 starting at indices 0 and length-k, respectively, and both of length k, are scrambled versions of each other, and the substrings of s1 and s2 starting at indices k and 0, respectively, and both of length length-k, are scrambled versions of each other. This is because a scrambled version of a string can be obtained by swapping any two non-adjacent substrings of the string.\\n\\n- By using dynamic programming to store the results of the subproblems, we can avoid recomputing the same subproblems multiple times, leading to a more efficient solution. The time complexity of this approach is O(n^4), and the space complexity is O(n^3)\\n\\n\\n```Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isScramble(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\\n        if s1 == s2:\\n            return True\\n        if sorted(s1) != sorted(s2):\\n            return False\\n        \\n        n = len(s1)\\n        dp = [[[False] * (n+1) for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\\n        \\n        for i in range(n):\\n            for j in range(n):\\n                dp[i][j][1] = (s1[i] == s2[j])\\n        \\n        for length in range(2, n+1):\\n            for i in range(n-length+1):\\n                for j in range(n-length+1):\\n                    for k in range(1, length):\\n                        if (dp[i][j][k] and dp[i+k][j+k][length-k]) or (dp[i][j+length-k][k] and dp[i+k][j][length-k]):\\n                            dp[i][j][length] = True\\n                            break\\n        \\n        return dp[0][0][n]\\n\\n    \\n        # An Upvote will be encouraging\\n\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean isScramble(String s1, String s2) {\\n        if (s1.equals(s2)) {\\n            return true;\\n        }\\n        if (!Arrays.equals(s1.chars().sorted().toArray(), s2.chars().sorted().toArray())) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        \\n        int n = s1.length();\\n        boolean[][][] dp = new boolean[n][n][n+1];\\n        \\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\\n                dp[i][j][1] = (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j));\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        for (int length = 2; length <= n; length++) {\\n            for (int i = 0; i <= n-length; i++) {\\n                for (int j = 0; j <= n-length; j++) {\\n                    for (int k = 1; k < length; k++) {\\n                        if ((dp[i][j][k] && dp[i+k][j+k][length-k]) || (dp[i][j+length-k][k] && dp[i+k][j][length-k])) {\\n                            dp[i][j][length] = true;\\n                            break;\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return dp[0][0][n];\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isScramble(string s1, string s2) {\\n        if (s1 == s2) {\\n            return true;\\n        }\\n        if (!is_permutation(s1.begin(), s1.end(), s2.begin())) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        \\n        int n = s1.length();\\n        vector<vector<vector<bool>>> dp(n, vector<vector<bool>>(n, vector<bool>(n+1, false)));\\n        \\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\\n                dp[i][j][1] = (s1[i] == s2[j]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        for (int length = 2; length <= n; length++) {\\n            for (int i = 0; i <= n-length; i++) {\\n                for (int j = 0; j <= n-length; j++) {\\n                    for (int k = 1; k < length; k++) {\\n                        if ((dp[i][j][k] && dp[i+k][j+k][length-k]) || (dp[i][j+length-k][k] && dp[i+k][j][length-k])) {\\n                            dp[i][j][length] = true;\\n                            break;\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return dp[0][0][n];\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/e2515d84-99cf-4499-80fb-fe458e1bbae2_1678932606.8004954.png)\\n\\n# Please UPVOTE \\uD83D\\uDC4D\\n",

It depends on which non-leaf nodes we want to swap, and no of swaps can be equal to or greater than zero.\\n- What happens when both strings are the same, then also both strings are scrambled.\\n- We can break it at any kth position, but the tree should be complete i.e. no empty nodes.\\n\\n- *This is MCM type question, as we need to check for every kth position.*\\n\\n#####  *Approach*\\n\\n- We will break the strings into two parts i.e from (0, ith) to (ith, n - ith) and check whether they are equal or not\\n- This arise two cases, whether the substring is swapped or not. So we have to check \\n ```\\n           left part of string1 == left part of string2 along with right part of string1 == right part of string2\\n                                                              or\\n\\t\\t      left part of string1 == right part of string2 along with right part of string1 == left part of string2\\n```\\n\\n- If any one condition becomes true then the string are scrambled.

So I started thinking about what will be the DP states, what things can we solve recursively, what will be the base case and transistions be like. I have used top-down dynamic programming to solve this problem.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nProblem asks us to find whether string `s1` is scramble of `s2` or not. We can also look this problem as for given two string `s1` and `s2`, and their substrings `s1[l1...r1]` and `s2[l2...r2]` are scrambles of each other or not. So the original question can be answered for the substrings from `0` to `n - 1`.\\n\\nWe have a `helper` function that returns us exactly what we need to find above, and it takes `l1`, `r1`, `l2` and `r2` as parameters.\\nNote: we will always call the `helper` function such that the length of both the substring from `s1` and `s2` are of same size.\\n\\nBase Case: if both the substrings are same, we simply return `true`.\\nNow, if it is not the base case, i.e. the substrings are not same, we need to further divide this substring into two more substrings `x` and `y` (as named in the question). As we can randomly partition the substring, we will have to check for all the partitions. After each partition, we have two options: \\n\\n**Option 1:** DON\\'T FLIP\\nWe keep the current substring of `s1` as it is, i.e. `x + y`. Here we check scrambles of `x` with the prefix of substring of `s2` of the same size as `x`, and check `y` with the remaining suffix of substring of `s2`, which will be also of same size as that of `y`.\\n\\n**Option 2:** FLIP\\nWe swap the `x` and `y` after partition, i.e. `y + x`. Here we check the scrambles of `x` with the suffix of substring of `s2` of the same size as `x`, and check `y` with the remaining prefix of substring of `s2`, which will be also of same size as that of `y`.\\n\\nIf none of the above options return true, we simply return false.\\n\\nIn the code below, I have used boolean arrays to store whether we have visited any state, and its answer. Hence it is a memoized DP. Also I have used the lambda functions just cause I am addicted to it :)\\n\\n<!-- # Complexityd -->\\n<!-- - Time complexity: -->\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n<!-- - Space complexity: -->\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isScramble(string s1, string s2) {\\n        int n = (int) s1.size();\\n        bool vis[n][n][n][n];\\n        bool dp[n][n][n][n];\\n        memset(vis, false, sizeof(vis));\\n        memset(dp, false, sizeof(dp));\\n\\n        // we are always calling the function such that, the substring we are checking on both the\\n        // substrings are of same length, i.e. (r1 - l1 + 1 == r2 - l2 + 1)\\n\\n        // helper takes in two substrings of both string\\n        // and returns whether they are scamble of each other\\n        function<bool(int, int, int, int)> helper = [&] (int l1, int r1, int l2, int r2) {\\n            if (vis[l1][r1][l2][r2]) return dp[l1][r1][l2][r2];\\n            vis[l1][r1][l2][r2] = true;\\n\\n            bool isSame = true;\\n            for (int i = l1, j = l2; i <= r1 && j <= r2; i++, j++)\\n                if (s1[i] != s2[j]) isSame = false;\\n            \\n            // is already same, simply return true\\n            if (isSame) {\\n                dp[l1][r1][l2][r2] = true;\\n                return true;\\n            }\\n\\n            bool res = false;\\n            for (int i = l1; i < r1; i++) {\\n                // opt1: prefix1 matches to prefix2 and suffix1 matches to suffix2\\n                res |= (helper(l1, i, l2, l2 + (i - l1)) && helper(i + 1, r1, l2 + (i - l1) + 1, r2));\\n\\n                // opt2: prefix1 matches to suffix2 and prefix2 matches to suffix1\\n                res |= (helper(l1, i, r2 - (i - l1), r2) && helper(i + 1, r1, l2, r2 - (i - l1) - 1));\\n            }\\n\\n            dp[l1][r1][l2][r2] = res;\\n            return res;\\n        };\\n\\n        return helper(0, n - 1, 0, n - 1);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nFeedbacks are appreciated :)",

YOU WILL DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE CODE LINE BY LINE AFTER SEEING THE APPROACH.**\\n\\n# Intuition of this Problem :\\n*The problem of determining whether two strings are scrambled versions of each other is a challenging one. One way to approach this problem is to use dynamic programming. The key idea is to divide the strings into two non-empty substrings at a random index, and recursively apply the same process to each of these substrings. If one or both of the substrings can be scrambled into the corresponding substrings of the other string, then the original strings can be scrambled into each other as well.*\\n\\n*To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can define a 3D boolean array dp[l][i][j] that stores whether a substring of length l starting at index i of s1 and a substring of length l starting at index j of s2 can be scrambled into each other. We can use a bottom-up approach and fill the array dp in a way that depends on its smaller values, i.e., we start with dp[1][i][j] for all i and j, which is simply the base case where l is 1. We then compute dp[l][i][j] for l > 1 by trying all possible ways to divide the substrings into two non-empty parts and recursively checking if the two parts can be scrambled into each other. If we find such a way, we set dp[l][i][j] to true.*\\n\\n*Finally, the answer to the problem is the value of dp[n][0][0], where n is the length of the input strings. This is because we want to determine whether the entire strings s1 and s2 can be scrambled into each other, which corresponds to the case where we consider substrings of length n starting at the beginning of both strings. If dp[n][0][0] is true, then the answer is yes, otherwise it is no.*\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n\\n# Approach for this Problem :\\n1. Get the length of both strings s1 and s2 and check if they are equal. If not, return false.\\n2. Define a 3D boolean array dp[n+1][n][n] to store the results, where n is the length of the strings.\\n3. Initialize all values of dp to false using memset.\\n4. For the base case where the length of strings is 1, loop through both strings and if the characters are equal, set dp[1][i][j] to true.\\n5. For the general case where the length of strings is greater than 1, loop through all possible lengths of substrings (from 2 to n) and all possible starting positions of substrings (from 0 to n - length).\\n6. Divide the strings into two substrings at all possible positions and check if they are scrambled strings of each other in both swapped and same order using dp[k][i][j] and dp[l-k][i+k][j+k] and dp[k][i][j+l-k] and dp[l-k][i+k][j] respectively. If any of these checks returns true, set dp[l][i][j] to true and break out of the loop.\\n7. Return dp[n][0][0], which is the final result.\\n\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Code :\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isScramble(string s1, string s2) {\\n        int n = s1.length(); // Get the length of the strings\\n        if (n != s2.length()) { // If the lengths are not equal, return false\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        bool dp[n + 1][n][n]; // Define a 3D boolean array to store the results\\n        memset(dp, false, sizeof(dp)); // Initialize all values to false\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // Base case: length 1\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\\n                if (s1[i] == s2[j]) { // If the characters are equal, set dp[1][i][j] to true\\n                    dp[1][i][j] = true;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        for (int l = 2; l <= n; l++) { // General case: length > 1\\n            for (int i = 0; i <= n - l; i++) {\\n                for (int j = 0; j <= n - l; j++) {\\n                    for (int k = 1; k < l; k++) { // Divide the strings into two substrings at all possible positions\\n                        if ((dp[k][i][j] && dp[l - k][i + k][j + k]) || // Check if the two substrings are scrambled strings of each other in swapped order\\n                            (dp[k][i][j + l - k] && dp[l - k][i + k][j])) { // Check if the two substrings are scrambled strings of each other in same order\\n                            dp[l][i][j] = true; // If any one of these checks returns true, set dp[l][i][j] to true\\n                            break;\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return dp[n][0][0]; // Return dp[n][0][0], which is the final result\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean isScramble(String s1, String s2) {\\n        int n = s1.length();\\n        if (n != s2.length()) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        boolean[][][] dp = new boolean[n + 1][n][n];\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\\n                if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) {\\n                    dp[1][i][j] = true;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        for (int l = 2; l <= n; l++) {\\n            for (int i = 0; i <= n - l; i++) {\\n                for (int j = 0; j <= n - l; j++) {\\n                    for (int k = 1; k < l; k++) {\\n                        if ((dp[k][i][j] && dp[l - k][i + k][j + k]) ||\\n                            (dp[k][i][j + l - k] && dp[l - k][i + k][j])) {\\n                            dp[l][i][j] = true;\\n                            break;\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return dp[n][0][0];\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n```Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isScramble(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\\n        n = len(s1)\\n        if n != len(s2):\\n            return False\\n        dp = [[[False for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            for j in range(n):\\n                if s1[i] == s2[j]:\\n                    dp[1][i][j] = True\\n        for l in range(2, n + 1):\\n            for i in range(n - l + 1):\\n                for j in range(n - l + 1):\\n                    for k in range(1, l):\\n                        if (dp[k][i][j] and dp[l - k][i + k][j + k]) or (dp[k][i][j + l - k] and dp[l - k][i + k][j]):\\n                            dp[l][i][j] = True\\n                            break\\n        return dp[n][0][0]\\n\\n```\\n\\n# Time Complexity and Space Complexity:\\n- **Time Complexity :** ***O(n^4)**, where n is the length of s1. This is because there are n^2 possible starting indices for the substrings, and for each pair (i,j), we iterate over k, which can take up to l-1 values. Therefore, the innermost loop runs at most (l-1) times for each pair (i,j). The total number of iterations of the innermost loop is bounded by the sum of (l-1) over all possible values of l, which is O(n^3). The initialization of dp takes O(n^3) time, so the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^4).*\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- **Space Complexity :** ***O(n^3)**, since we use a 3D array of size n+1 x n x n to store the intermediate results.*\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nThe problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach where we check if the substrings of s1 and s2 are scrambled strings or not. We start by checking the base cases, which is when the length of the substring is 1. We then recursively check all possible split points and if the substrings are swapped or not.\\n\\n# Approach\\nThe solution uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Let dp[i][j][len] be true if the substring s1[i:i+len] is a scrambled string of the substring s2[j:j+len], and false otherwise.\\n\\nThe base case is when len = 1, in which case we just need to check if the characters in the substrings are equal. If they are, then we set dp[i][j][1] to true, otherwise to false.\\n\\nFor the recursive case, we try all possible split points of the substrings s1[i:i+len] and s2[j:j+len]. If the substrings are split at position k, we have two possibilities: either the substrings are not swapped, or they are swapped. If they are not swapped, then we need to check if the left halves and right halves are scrambled strings, i.e., dp[i][j][k] && dp[i+k][j+k][len-k]. If they are swapped, then we need to check if the left half of s1 and the right half of s2 are scrambled strings, and if the right half of s1 and the left half of s2 are scrambled strings, i.e., dp[i][j+len-k][k] && dp[i+k][j][len-k].\\n\\nThe overall solution is the value of dp[0][0][n], where n is the length of the input strings.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(n^4), where n is the length of the input strings. This is because we have three nested loops, and the length of the substrings can be up to n.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity of the solution is O(n^3), where n is the length of the input strings. This is because we need to store the results of all possible substring combinations in the 3D array dp.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isScramble(string s1, string s2) {\\n        if (s1 == s2) {\\n            return true;\\n        }\\n        int n = s1.length();\\n        if (n != s2.length()) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        vector<int> count(26, 0);\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            count[s1[i] - \\'a\\']++;\\n            count[s2[i] - \\'a\\']--;\\n        }\\n        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\\n            if (count[i] != 0) {\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(n + 1, -1)));\\n        return isScrambleHelper(s1, s2, 0, 0, n, dp);\\n    }\\n    \\n    bool isScrambleHelper(string& s1, string& s2, int i, int j, int len, vector<vector<vector<int>>>& dp) {\\n        if (dp[i][j][len] != -1) {\\n            return dp[i][j][len];\\n        }\\n        if (s1.substr(i, len) == s2.substr(j, len)) {\\n            return dp[i][j][len] = true;\\n        }\\n        vector<int> count(26, 0);\\n        for (int k = 0; k < len; k++) {\\n            count[s1[i + k] - \\'a\\']++;\\n            count[s2[j + k] - \\'a\\']--;\\n        }\\n        for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++) {\\n            if (count[k] != 0) {\\n                return dp[i][j][len] = false;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        for (int k = 1; k < len; k++) {\\n            if ((isScrambleHelper(s1, s2, i, j, k, dp) && isScrambleHelper(s1, s2, i + k, j + k, len - k, dp)) ||\\n               (isScrambleHelper(s1, s2, i, j + len - k, k, dp) && isScrambleHelper(s1, s2, i + k, j, len - k, dp))) {\\n                return dp[i][j][len] = true;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return dp[i][j][len] = false;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```",

The idea behind dynamic programming is to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems in memory so that we can avoid recalculating them.\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we create a 3D boolean array called canScramble to store intermediate results. canScramble[k][i][j] represents whether the substring of s1 starting at index i and of length k can be scrambled into the substring of s2 starting at index j and of length k.\\n\\nThe base case for our dynamic programming approach is when both strings have length 1. In this case, we simply compare the two characters at the same index in both strings and store the result.\\n\\nNext, we solve the subproblems in a bottom-up manner. We start by looking at substrings of length 2, then length 3, and so on, until we reach the length of the entire string. For each substring of length len, we consider all possible ways to split the substring into two parts, with lengths k and len - k. We then check if the two parts of s1 can be scrambled into the corresponding parts of s2. We do this by checking the following conditions:\\n\\n1) The first part of s1 can be scrambled into the first part of s2 and the second part of s1 can be scrambled into the second part of s2.\\n2) The first part of s1 can be scrambled into the second part of s2 and the second part of s1 can be scrambled into the first part of s2.\\n\\nIf any of these conditions is true, then we can scramble the substring of s1 into the substring of s2. We store the result in canScramble[len][i][j].\\n\\nFinally, we return the value of canScramble[n][0][0], which represents whether the entire s1 can be scrambled into s2.\\n",

It is the base case. Or if the current \\'S\\' has length = 1, then also we need to return true or false depending upon its equality with its counterpart in \\'R\\'.\\n* Let\\u2019s say that we cut the string \\'S\\' at index i.

We sort the ```s1``` and ```s2```, if ```s1!=s2```, return ```false``` because in this case, ```s1```miss some letters in ```s2```.\\n2. If ```s1 == s2```, ok they are same so return ```true```.\\n3. Else, we try every possible position to swap or not, to see if we can find a ```true``` case. Note once we find a ```true``` case, we do not need to test anymore, we can return ```true``` immediately.\\n\\nHere is my code:\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isScramble(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\\n        memo = {}\\n        def dfs(s1, s2):\\n            if (s1, s2) not in memo:\\n                if sorted(s1) != sorted(s2):\\n                    flag = False\\n                elif s1 == s2:\\n                    flag = True\\n                else:\\n                    for i in range(1, len(s1)):\\n                        flag = (dfs(s1[:i], s2[:i]) and dfs(s1[i:], s2[i:])) \\\\\\n                                or (dfs(s1[:i], s2[-i:]) and dfs(s1[i:], s2[:-i]))\\n                        if flag:\\n                            break\\n                memo[s1,s2] = flag\\n            return memo[s1,s2]\\n              \\n        return dfs(s1, s2)\\n```\\nAlso, you can solve the [Regular Expression Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/) and [Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/) with the same template method.",

Then that would be a 4D DP problem with $$n^5$$ time complexity.\n\nMy point is that you can complicate problems as much as you like, but there should be a limit!.

Then that would be a 4D DP problem with $$n^5$$ time complexity.\n\nMy point is that you can complicate problems as much as you like, but there should be a limit!.

Specifically, we can create a map to store the boolean results of previous function calls. Each key in the map will be a concatenation of the two input strings, separated by a special character such as \"#\". The corresponding value will be the boolean result indicating whether the second string can be scrambled into the first string.\\n- Define a recursive function that takes two strings as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the second string can be scrambled into the first string. This function will be called repeatedly with different substrings of the input strings.\\n- Base cases:\\na. If the lengths of the two input strings are not equal, return false.\\nb. If the two input strings are the same string, return true.\\n- For each possible split point in the input strings (excluding the first and last characters), do the following:\\na.

If any combination is a scrambled version, you can set dp[i][j][k] to true and break out of the loop.\\nhere\\'s the solution for the problem\\nbool isScramble(string s1, string s2) {\\n     if (s1 == s2) {\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n    if (s1.size() != s2.size()) {\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n    int n = s1.size();\\n    vector<vector<vector<bool>>> dp(n + 1, vector<vector<bool>>(n, vector<bool>(n)));\\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\\n            dp[1][i][j] = (s1[i] == s2[j]);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n - len + 1; i++) {\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n - len + 1; j++) {\\n                for (int k = 1; k < len; k++) {\\n                    if ((dp[k][i][j] && dp[len - k][i + k][j + k]) || (dp[k][i][j + len - k] && dp[len - k][i + k][j])) {\\n                        dp[len][i][j] = true;\\n                        break;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return dp[n][0][0];\\n}\\n\\n\\n\\n"
