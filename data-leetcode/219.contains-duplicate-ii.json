If you like this solution or find it useful,* ***please upvote*** *this post.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Idea:***\\n\\nWith a singly linked list, the _only_ way to find the end of the list, and thus the **n**\\'th node from the end, is to actually iterate all the way to the end. The challenge here is attemping to find the solution in only one pass. A naive approach here might be to store pointers to each node in an array, allowing us to calculate the **n**\\'th from the end once we reach the end, but that would take **O(M) extra space**, where **M** is the length of the linked list.\\n\\nA slightly less naive approach would be to only store only the last **n+1** node pointers in the array. This could be achieved by overwriting the elements of the storage array in circlular fashion as we iterate through the list. This would lower the **space complexity** to **O(N+1)**.\\n\\nIn order to solve this problem in only one pass and **O(1) extra space**, however, we would need to find a way to _both_ reach the end of the list with one pointer _and also_ reach the **n**\\'th node from the end simultaneously with a second pointer.\\n\\nTo do that, we can simply stagger our two pointers by **n** nodes by giving the first pointer (**fast**) a head start before starting the second pointer (**slow**). Doing this will cause **slow** to reach the **n**\\'th node from the end at the same time that **fast** reaches the end.\\n\\n![Visual 1](https://i.imgur.com/BSiLKj0.png)\\n\\nSince we will need access to the node _before_ the target node in order to remove the target node, we can use **fast.next == null** as our exit condition, rather than **fast == null**, so that we stop one node earlier.\\n\\nThis will unfortunately cause a problem when **n** is the same as the length of the list, which would make the first node the target node, and thus make it impossible to find the node _before_ the target node. If that\\'s the case, however, we can just **return head.next** without needing to stitch together the two sides of the target node.\\n\\nOtherwise, once we succesfully find the node _before_ the target, we can then stitch it together with the node _after_ the target, and then **return head**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Implementation:***\\n\\nThere are only minor differences between the code of all four languages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Javascript Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **60ms / 40.6MB** (beats 100% / 13%).\\n```javascript\\nvar removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {\\n    let fast = head, slow = head\\n    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) fast = fast.next\\n    if (!fast) return head.next\\n    while (fast.next) fast = fast.next, slow = slow.next\\n    slow.next = slow.next.next\\n    return head\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Python Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **28ms / 13.9MB** (beats 92% / 99%).\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:\\n        fast, slow = head, head\\n        for _ in range(n): fast = fast.next\\n        if not fast: return head.next\\n        while fast.next: fast, slow = fast.next, slow.next\\n        slow.next = slow.next.next\\n        return head\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Java Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 36.5MB** (beats 100% / 97%).\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {\\n        ListNode fast = head, slow = head;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) fast = fast.next;\\n        if (fast == null) return head.next;\\n        while (fast.next != null) {\\n            fast = fast.next;\\n            slow = slow.next;\\n        }\\n        slow.next = slow.next.next;\\n        return head;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***C++ Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 10.6MB** (beats 100% / 93%).\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {\\n        ListNode *fast = head, *slow = head;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) fast = fast->next;\\n        if (!fast) return head->next;\\n        while (fast->next) fast = fast->next, slow = slow->next;\\n        slow->next = slow->next->next;\\n        return head;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

If you like this solution or find it useful,* ***please upvote*** *this post.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Idea:***\\n\\nWith a singly linked list, the _only_ way to find the end of the list, and thus the **n**\\'th node from the end, is to actually iterate all the way to the end. The challenge here is attemping to find the solution in only one pass. A naive approach here might be to store pointers to each node in an array, allowing us to calculate the **n**\\'th from the end once we reach the end, but that would take **O(M) extra space**, where **M** is the length of the linked list.\\n\\nA slightly less naive approach would be to only store only the last **n+1** node pointers in the array. This could be achieved by overwriting the elements of the storage array in circlular fashion as we iterate through the list. This would lower the **space complexity** to **O(N+1)**.\\n\\nIn order to solve this problem in only one pass and **O(1) extra space**, however, we would need to find a way to _both_ reach the end of the list with one pointer _and also_ reach the **n**\\'th node from the end simultaneously with a second pointer.\\n\\nTo do that, we can simply stagger our two pointers by **n** nodes by giving the first pointer (**fast**) a head start before starting the second pointer (**slow**). Doing this will cause **slow** to reach the **n**\\'th node from the end at the same time that **fast** reaches the end.\\n\\n![Visual 1](https://i.imgur.com/BSiLKj0.png)\\n\\nSince we will need access to the node _before_ the target node in order to remove the target node, we can use **fast.next == null** as our exit condition, rather than **fast == null**, so that we stop one node earlier.\\n\\nThis will unfortunately cause a problem when **n** is the same as the length of the list, which would make the first node the target node, and thus make it impossible to find the node _before_ the target node. If that\\'s the case, however, we can just **return head.next** without needing to stitch together the two sides of the target node.\\n\\nOtherwise, once we succesfully find the node _before_ the target, we can then stitch it together with the node _after_ the target, and then **return head**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Implementation:***\\n\\nThere are only minor differences between the code of all four languages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Javascript Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **60ms / 40.6MB** (beats 100% / 13%).\\n```javascript\\nvar removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {\\n    let fast = head, slow = head\\n    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) fast = fast.next\\n    if (!fast) return head.next\\n    while (fast.next) fast = fast.next, slow = slow.next\\n    slow.next = slow.next.next\\n    return head\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Python Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **28ms / 13.9MB** (beats 92% / 99%).\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:\\n        fast, slow = head, head\\n        for _ in range(n): fast = fast.next\\n        if not fast: return head.next\\n        while fast.next: fast, slow = fast.next, slow.next\\n        slow.next = slow.next.next\\n        return head\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Java Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 36.5MB** (beats 100% / 97%).\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {\\n        ListNode fast = head, slow = head;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) fast = fast.next;\\n        if (fast == null) return head.next;\\n        while (fast.next != null) {\\n            fast = fast.next;\\n            slow = slow.next;\\n        }\\n        slow.next = slow.next.next;\\n        return head;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***C++ Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 10.6MB** (beats 100% / 93%).\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {\\n        ListNode *fast = head, *slow = head;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) fast = fast->next;\\n        if (!fast) return head->next;\\n        while (fast->next) fast = fast->next, slow = slow->next;\\n        slow->next = slow->next->next;\\n        return head;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

We can find the total number of nodes in the linked list and then traverse the list again to find the nth node from the end. We can then remove the node by updating the pointer of the previous node.\\n\\n# Approach:\\n\\n1. Initialize a pointer to the head of the linked list and a count variable to 0.\\n2. Traverse the linked list and increment the count for each node until the end of the list is reached.\\n3. If the count is equal to n, remove the head node and return the next node as the new head.\\n4. Otherwise, initialize the pointer to the head of the linked list again and set n to count - n - 1.\\n5. Traverse the linked list again and update the pointer of the previous node to remove the nth node from the end.\\n6. Return the head of the linked list.\\n\\n# Complexity:\\n\\n- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the linked list.

(Figure 2)\\n- Then, we walk `left` and `right` in tandem, until `right` reaches the end of the list.\\n- At this point `left` will point to the *Nth node from the end*, which we want to remove.  (Figure 3)\\n```\\nleft                       right\\n| 1 | -> | 2 | -> | 3 | -> | 4 | -> | 5 |\\n\\nFig 2\\n```\\n```\\n                  left                    right\\n| 1 | -> | 2 | -> | 3 | -> | 4 | -> | 5 |   *\\n\\nFig 3\\n```\\nThis will work. However, we have to maintain a previous pointer to `left`, in order to delete `left`. We also need to take care of the corner case where, the node to be deleted is the `head` of our list. i.e when `n` = 5 in our example.\\n\\nWe'll instead follow a cleaner approach which is discussed next.\\n#### Second Approach\\n- We employ a node called the `preHeader` node, whose `Next` pointer points to the head of our list.\\n- Then we point our `left` pointer to the `preHeader` to start off with. (Figure 4)\\n- The advantage of this approach is that, when our `right` pointer gets to the end of our list, `left` will be pointing to the node just before the *Nth node from the end*, which makes deleting that node very straight forward.  (Figure 5/6)\\n- Another advantage is that, we do not need to code anything special for handling the corner case where `n` = 5 in our example. \\n```\\nleft                                 right\\n| ph | -> | 1 | -> | 2 | -> | 3 | -> | 4 | -> | 5 |\\n\\nFig 4\\n```\\n```\\n                   left                             right\\n| ph | -> | 1 | -> | 2 | -> | 3 | -> | 4 | -> | 5 |   *\\n\\nFig 5\\n```\\n```\\n                   left                    right\\n| ph | -> | 1 | -> | 2 | -> | 4 | -> | 5 |   *\\n\\nFig 6\\n```\\n\\n```c\\nfunc removeNthFromEnd(head *ListNode, n int) *ListNode {\\n    if head == nil || n <= 0 {return head}\\n    preHeader := &ListNode{Next: head}\\n    left, right := preHeader, head\\n\\n    for i := 0; right != nil && i < n; i++ {\\n        right = right.Next\\n    }\\n    for right != nil {\\n        left, right = left.Next, right.Next\\n    }\\n    left.Next = left.Next.Next\\n    return preHeader.Next\\n}\\n```",

I\\'d apparently visited this a few months back and made a hash of it, but after revisiting having learnt some base techniques it\\'s much easier.\\n\\n**(1)** \\nOk obviously need to delete a node. So best know how to do that. Already in my mind i\\'m seeing:\\n\\n``` \\nconst deleteNextNode = (node) => node.next = node.next.next\\n```\\n\\nWhich means if we want to delete a node, we need to get the node before it.\\n\\n**(2)**\\nThen the other bit, which actually comes before in the description, is to get the `Nth` node from the end. In our case, as we want to get the `Nth` node from the end of the linked list to delete it, we actually want to get the `Nth+1` node **from the end**. Seems like a slow/fast 2 pointer solution.\\n\\nTo do this, i\\'m seeing the beginning of the answer to the entire question:\\n\\n```\\nvar removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {\\n\\n    if(!head) return head\\n\\n    let [slow, fast] = [head, head]\\n\\t\\n    // move fast ahead by n\\n\\t// have to be careful about --n or n-- here. \\n\\t// As we want the node before the one we are deleting,\\n\\t// we want fast to be ahead by an additional node\\n\\t// if the question was just to return slow, i\\'d probably use --n instead\\n    while(n--){\\n        fast = fast.next\\n    }\\n    \\n\\t// we want to stop when fast.next is null\\n\\t// we move both along the linked list \\n\\t// keeping the same distance between them\\n    while(fast.next){\\n        [slow, fast] = [slow.next, fast.next]\\n    }\\n\\t...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOne final issue came up when submitting. What happens when `n` is equal to the length of the linked list. We\\'ll we run into problems. Easiest solution I could think of is to create a dummy node that is before the linked list. That allows us to remove the head node if the Nth node from the end is the head node.\\n\\n**Final submission:**\\n```\\n/**\\n * @param {ListNode} head\\n * @param {number} n\\n * @return {ListNode}\\n */\\nvar removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {\\n    if(!head) return head\\n    let begin = { val: -1, next: head }\\n       \\n    let [slow, fast] = [begin, begin]\\n    // move fast ahead by n\\n    while(n--){\\n        fast = fast.next\\n    }\\n    \\n    while(fast.next){\\n        [slow, fast] = [slow.next, fast.next]\\n    }\\n    \\n    // remove slow.next\\n    removeNextNode(slow)\\n    \\n    return begin.next\\n};\\n\\nconst removeNextNode = (node) => { \\n    node.next = node.next.next\\n}\\n```",

                "content": "# Solution no. 01\\nThe first solution helps you understand the basics with simple steps. \\n\\n# Intuition\\n\\nTo determine the node to remove, which is n positions from the end, we need to figure out how many positions we should move from the front to reach the desired node. By counting the total number of nodes in the linked list, we gain this insight and can then adjust the connections accordingly to remove the targeted node from the end.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Count the total number of nodes in the linked list by traversing it with a curr pointer.\\n1. Calculate the position to move from the front to reach the node n positions from the end.\\n1. Reset the count and curr to traverse the list again.\\n1. If the node to be removed is the first node, return head.next.\\n1. Traverse the list while keeping track of the count.\\n1. When the count matches the calculated position before the node to be removed, update the connection to skip the node.\\n1. Exit the loop after performing the removal.\\n1. Return the updated head.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nWe traverse the linked list twice, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nWe only use a few variables, so the space complexity is O(1).\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:\\n        count = 0\\n        curr = head\\n        while curr:\\n            count += 1\\n            curr = curr.next\\n\\n        check = count - n - 1\\n        count = 0\\n        curr = head\\n\\n        # Removing the first node\\n        if check == -1:  \\n            return head.next\\n\\n        while curr:\\n            if count == check:\\n                curr.next = curr.next.next\\n                # As the removal is done, Exit the loop\\n                break  \\n            curr = curr.next\\n            count += 1\\n\\n        return head\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Solution no. 02\\n\\n# Intuition\\nIn our first approach we counted the total number of nodes in the linked list and then identify the n-th node from the end by its position from the beginning. While this counting approach could work, it involves traversing the list twice: once to count the nodes and once to find the node to remove. This double traversal can be inefficient, especially for large lists.\\n\\nA more efficient approach comes from recognizing that we don\\'t really need to know the total number of nodes in the list to solve this problem. Instead, we can utilize two pointers to maintain a specific gap between them as they traverse the list. This gap will be the key to identifying the n-th node from the end.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. We\\'ll use two pointers, first and second, initialized to a dummy node at the beginning of the linked list. The goal is to maintain a gap of n+1 nodes between the two pointers as we traverse the list.\\n\\n1. Move the first pointer n+1 steps ahead, creating a gap of n nodes between first and second.\\n\\n1. Now, move both first and second pointers one step at a time until the first pointer reaches the end of the list. This ensures that the gap between the two pointers remains constant at n nodes.\\n\\n1. When first reaches the end, the second pointer will be pointing to the node right before the node we want to remove (n-th node from the end).\\n\\n1. Update the second.next pointer to skip the n-th node, effectively removing it from the list.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n The solution involves a single pass through the linked list, so the time complexity is **O(N)**, where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nWe are using a constant amount of extra space to store the dummy, first, and second pointers, so the space complexity is **O(1)**.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:\\n        dummy = ListNode(0)\\n        dummy.next = head\\n        \\n        first = dummy\\n        second = dummy\\n        \\n        # Advance first pointer so that the gap between first and second is n+1 nodes apart\\n        for i in range(n+1):\\n            first = first.next\\n        \\n        # Move first to the end, maintaining the gap\\n        while first:\\n            first = first.next\\n            second = second.next\\n        \\n        # Remove the nth node from the end\\n        second.next = second.next.next\\n        \\n        return dummy.next \\n\\n```\\n\\n",

                "content": "# Solution 1: Two Passes\\nThe reason why this problem is a medium and not an easy one is because we need to remove the nth node **from the end**. To do this, we need to find the length of the linked list. That is why we need 2 passes: one to find the length of the linked list and another to actually remove the node.\\n\\nWe first set `i` as the head and iterate the entire list, with each iteration adding 1 to the length. That is really basic.\\n\\nNow that we have our length, we can remove the node. To remove a node, you set the previous node\\'s link to the node after the one we remove. \\n\\nSay we want to remove node 2: we set 1\\'s next link to 3 instead of 2. Therefore the linked list becomes 0, 1, 3.\\n```txt\\n 0------->1------->2------->3\\n 0        1        2        3\\n|_|----->|_|-------------->|_|\\n```\\n\\nAlso, the corner case is that `n` is the length, in which we don\\'t do anything but return the node after `head`.\\n\\nNow onto removing the node:\\nWe move our `j` pointer to the node **before** the node we want to remove. To do that, we need to mvoe it `length-n-1` times. \\n\\nOnce we are at that desired node, we just set `j`\\'s next pointer to the node after the node we want to remove. \\n\\nFor those of you who are worried about memory leaks: python has a garbage collection system that\\'s automated, so you don\\'t have to take care of that.\\n```py\\n# Definition for singly-linked list.\\n# class ListNode(object):\\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\\n#         self.val = val\\n#         self.next = next\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type head: ListNode\\n        :type n: int\\n        :rtype: ListNode\\n        \"\"\"\\n        i = head\\n        length = 0\\n        while i:\\n            i = i.next\\n            length += 1\\n            \\n        if length == n:\\n            return head.next\\n        j = head\\n        for x in range(length-n-1):\\n            j = j.next\\n        j.next = j.next.next\\n        return head\\n```\\n\\n# Solution 2: One Pass\\nThis is the optimal solution: we maintain two pointers and are able to do the entire thing (find length and remove node) in **one pass**.\\n\\nThe trick is that the distance between the 2 pointers is `n`, so when we have the right pointer at the end, the left pointer will be exactly at the node before the node we want to remove. \\n\\nNote: to prevent the right node from becoming None (go after the last node), I use `while right.next` instead of `while right` as my loop definition\\n\\nWe first move the right pointer `n` times, so that the distance between the left and right pointers is `n`.\\n\\nNow we maintain this \"window\" and move both pointers until the right pointer is at the end of the list. Now, the left pointer is at the node before the node we want to remove, so we can just remove the node. \\n\\nIf you want to know how to remove a node, I explain it in the first solution (so scroll up). \\n```py\\n# Definition for singly-linked list.\\n# class ListNode(object):\\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\\n#         self.val = val\\n#         self.next = next\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type head: ListNode\\n        :type n: int\\n        :rtype: ListNode\\n        \"\"\"\\n        left = right = head\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            right = right.next\\n            \\n        if not right:\\n            return left.next\\n        \\n        while right.next:\\n            left = left.next\\n            right = right.next\\n        left.next = left.next.next\\n        return head\\n```\\n\\n**If you liked this, please upvote to support me!**",

They\\'re both O(n).  I still think that this is a classic Tortoise and Hare problem, and that\\'s what they\\'ll be looking for.  But you can Easily defend the Array version as well imo (On Time Complexity at least.  It\\'s still worse on space because it\\'s O(n) space whereas Tortoise and Hare is O(1).).  Take your pick. \\n\\nI wrote two solutions for this problem.  First is the most performant, and the most \\'clever\\' solution that they\\'ll probably want in an interview.  First solution uses tortoise and hare pointers to locate the node which needs to be removed.  Second is FAR easier to code imo, but I\\'m not sure they would consider it optimal in an interview if they\\'re looking for constant space.  Second stores linked list nodes in an array and then we can locate which nodes we need Very easily and remove them.  That said, it does take extra space to store in the array and this is a classic \\'tortoise and hare\\' problem - so if they\\'re asking it, they\\'re likely looking for the first solution.  If you strugle to implement it on the spot though, the second version might save face in a pinch.\\n\\nEitherway though, the basic intuition is to \\'locate\\' the node Before the one to be removed.  There are three possibilities here.  1.) Node to be removed is the head node.  I.E. - The one we need to locate Before it doesn\\'t exist.  In this case, our hare will end up at null after it loops. Or in the Array version, llMap.length - n - 1 will be -1.  We then just simply return head.next which \\'removes\\' the original head node.  2.) Node to be removed is at the End of the list.  In this case, our node Before it has a node.next, but node.next.next = null.  Here our code for case 3 works as well because it will just set node.next = null, which \\'removes\\' our node.next (The last node.) 3.)  Normal Linked List node removal.  There is a node.next (One to be removed since we located the node Before it.), and there is a node.next.next.  In this case, we just set node.next = node.next.next and the node is removed.  Hardest part about this problem is locating the correct node.  Tortoise and Hare both start at head.  We then move hare forward n.  After moving hare, we check to see if hare === null (!hare).  If it does, we know the node to remove is the first and we go with case 1.  Then we begin to move tortoise and hare in tandem until hare.next === null.  This means hare is now at the end of the list and turtle is one before the node we need to remove. We have located the correct node.  The storing in an array one is pretty simple, we just store them, and can instantly look up the nth from the end by its array index.\\n\\n```\\nconst removeNthFromEnd = (head, n) => {  \\n  let tortoise = head, hare = head;\\n  \\n  while (n) hare = hare.next, n--;\\n  if (!hare) return head.next;\\n  \\n  while (hare.next) hare = hare.next, tortoise = tortoise.next;       \\n         \\n  tortoise.next = tortoise.next.next\\n  \\n  return head\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTrack by array version.\\n\\n```\\nconst removeNthFromEnd = (head, n) => {\\n  const llMap = [];\\n  \\n  while (head) {\\n    llMap.push(head);\\n    head = head.next;\\n  }\\n    \\n  const prevNode = llMap[llMap.length - n - 1];\\n  \\n  if (!prevNode) return llMap[0].next;\\n  \\n  prevNode.next = prevNode.next.next;\\n    \\n  return llMap[0];\\n}\\n```",

                "content": "**Context**\\\\\\nWe\\'re given two parameters: `head` and `n`. The former stores a reference to the head of the linked list. The latter stores an integer representing the xth final node that we must remove (*i.e. if `n` is 2, then we must remove the 2nd final node*). The problem requires us to remove the nth final node from the linked list.\\n\\n**Solution**\\\\\\nThe way to solve this problem in one-pass is by utilizing two pointer variables: `slow` and `fast`. In order to find the nth final node, we\\'ll need to find the total number of nodes in the linked list. However, this (finding the total number of nodes) requires N additional time - which prevents us from solving the problem in one pass.\\n\\nRather than finding the nth final node, we can find the nth node instead (*i.e. if the total number of nodes is 5 and `n` is 2, then we\\'ll want to remove the 3rd node*). This can be achieved by executing two tasks:\\n* move `fast` `n` times beforehand\\n* move `slow` and `fast` in parallel until `fast.next` is null.\\n\\nBy the time `fast.next` is null, `slow` should be storing a reference to the nth node\\'s previous node. The way to remove the nth node is by having `slow` point to the nth node\\'s next node (`slow.next = slow.next.next`).\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:\\n        slow = fast = head\\n        \\n        for _ in range(n):\\n            fast = fast.next\\n        \\n        # if fast is null, then it implies that we must remove\\n        # the first node. Hence, we\\'ll return the next node\\n        # (after the first node) as an answer.\\n        if not fast:\\n            return head.next\\n        \\n        while fast.next:\\n            slow = slow.next\\n            fast = fast.next\\n        \\n        slow.next = slow.next.next\\n        return head\\n```\\n\\\\\\nThe time complexity is O(N) because we must iterate through the linked list at most once (moving `fast` `n` times beforehand + moving `fast` until it\\'s null).\\n\\nThe space complexity is O(1) because we\\'re only using few additional spaces to initialize few variables.",

In this question, we can start by initializing a pointer ```fast``` at the head of the linked list given. Then we can move this pointer ```n``` nodes further. Then we can intialize a pointer ```slow``` to ```head```, and ```prev``` to ```null``` (this pointer being the one trailing ```slow```). We can move ```fast```, ```slow```, and ```prev``` simultaneously, and once ```fast``` becomes ```null``` (passes the end of the list), ```slow``` will be pointing to the ```n```th node from the end, which can now be removed. \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {\\n        ListNode fast = head;\\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){\\n            fast = fast.next;\\n        }\\n        ListNode slow = head;\\n        ListNode prev = null;\\n        while(fast != null){\\n            fast = fast.next;\\n            prev = slow;\\n            slow = slow.next;\\n        }\\n        if(prev == null){\\n            return head.next;\\n        }\\n        prev.next = slow.next;\\n        return head;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\nThis solution is also done in ```O(n)``` time, and ```O(1)``` space, but the difference being that it is done in one pass. \\n\\nHope this helps!!",

In this way, `s` is always the preceding node of the node to remove.When e is the `tail` node of the List (i.e. when `e.next = null`), we simply remove s.next (`s.next = s.next.next`). For example,\\n```\\nGiven 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - N, n = 2,\\ns is always 2 nodes distance in front of e\\nD - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - N\\n            s\\n                    e\\n3 is the node to remove.\\n```\\n**Code**\\n```\\n    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {\\n\\n        if (head == null || head.next == null) {\\n            return null;\\n        }\\n\\n        ListNode dummyHead = new ListNode(0), s = dummyHead, e = s;\\n        dummyHead.next = head;\\n\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            e = e.next;\\n        }\\n        while (e.next != null) {\\n            e = e.next;\\n            s = s.next;\\n        }\\n        s.next = s.next.next;\\n\\n        return dummyHead.next;\\n    }\\n```\\n**Trick**\\nTo remove a node in List, we need to figure out its preceding node.

Let\\'s say `n = 2` and we have a LinkedList `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 `. Then we want to make it as `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5`. Therefore, we want to have make `left` pointer points to `3`, and we could do `left.next = left.next.next`. But how do we achieve it?\\n  \\n**Oberservation**\\nThis is what we want eventually so we can perform the operation mentioned above. We can obeserve that the distance between `left` and `right` are `n+1`. \\n```\\n1   ->   2   ->   3   ->   4   ->   5  ->  null\\n                 left                      right\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t |----      n+1        ------|\\n```\\n\\nHow do we achieve it?

But, since its formula is pretty sleek, we proceed as follows:\\n\\nsuppose we have **nCr** and we have to find **nC(r+1)**, like **5C3** and **5C4**\\n==> `5C3 = 5*4*3 / 1*2*3`\\n\\nto get the next term we multiply numerator with its next term and denominator with its next term. As, \\n==> `5C4 = 5*4*3 * 2 / 1*2*3 * 4`\\n\\nWe are following this simple maths logic to get the complete row in **O(N)** time.\\n\\n**Note:-** We didnt actually need the variable temp.

How we generate next row, using current? We need:\\n1. Add `1` to the beginning of new row.\\n2. Evaluate sums of elements with indexes differ by `1`.\\n3. Add `1` to the end of new row.\\n\\nThis can be written as `[1]+[r[j]+r[j+1] for j in range(len(r)-1)]+[1]`.\\n\\nWhat we need to do now is to repeat this `k` times and this is all, we can use `reduce` function to do it.\\n\\n**Complexity**: space complexity as it asked is only `O(k)`, each moment of time we have only one(two) rows. Time complexity is `O(k^2)` because for each row we do `k` iterations. Theoretically time complexity can be reduced to `O(k)` if we use direct formulas for elements of pascal triangle, but `k` is very small and there will no be difference in this problem.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def getRow(self, rowIndex):\\n        return reduce(lambda r,_:[1]+[r[j]+r[j+1] for j in range(len(r)-1)]+[1], range(rowIndex),[1])\\n```\\n\\n### Solution 2\\n\\nLet us note, that `1001^5 = 1 005 010 010 005 001`, so if we want to find row of Pascal triangle for small numbers `k`, then we can just use power of number `1000...001` and then split it into parts. For thes problem it is enough to take `10000000001` and then split by blocks with size `10`. \\n\\n**Complexity**: Space complexity is also `O(k)`, but more like `O(10k)`, because we have string of length `10k` in the end.

One approach is to calculate the entire Pascal\\'s triangle up to the given row, and then return the row. However, this approach requires calculating all the previous rows, which is inefficient.\\n\\nA better approach is to use the formula for the i-th element of the k-th row of the triangle, which is the binomial coefficient C(k, i-1). This formula allows us to calculate each element of the row separately, without having to compute the entire triangle.\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe approach is to iterate from i = 0 to i = rowIndex, and compute each element of the row using the formula for the binomial coefficient. We can use the previously computed value to optimize the calculation of the coefficient. We only store the current row, rather than storing the entire triangle.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:The algorithm computes each element of the row from scratch, and there are rowIndex elements in the row. Therefore, the time complexity is O(rowIndex).\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:The algorithm stores only one row at a time, and there are rowIndex elements in the row.

It takes an integer `rowIndex` as input and is expected to return a list of integers.\\n- `res` is initialized as a list containing a single list with the value `[1]`. This list represents the first row of Pascal\\'s Triangle.\\n\\n```python\\n    for i in range(rowIndex):\\n        temp = [0] + res[-1] + [0]\\n        row = []\\n```\\n- A loop is set up to iterate from 0 to `rowIndex - 1`. This loop is used to calculate the subsequent rows of Pascal\\'s Triangle.\\n- `temp` is initialized as a new list, which is formed by adding `0` at the beginning and end of the last row in `res`. This is done to create a buffer of zeros around the row to calculate the next row.\\n- `row` is initialized as an empty list. This list will store the values of the current row being calculated.\\n\\n```python\\n        for j in range(len(res[-1])+1):\\n            row.append(temp[j] + temp[j+1])\\n```\\n- Another nested loop is set up to iterate over the elements of `temp` and calculate the values of the current row.\\n- For each element at index `j` in `temp`, it adds the value at index `j` and the value at index `j+1` and appends the result to the `row` list.\\n\\n```python\\n        res.append(row)\\n```\\n- After calculating all the values for the current row, the `row` list is appended to the `res` list. This adds a new row to the list, representing the current row of Pascal\\'s Triangle.\\n\\n```python\\n    return res[-1]\\n```\\n- After the loop completes (i.e., all rows up to `rowIndex` have been calculated and added to `res`), the function returns the last row of `res`, which corresponds to the row at index `rowIndex` in Pascal\\'s Triangle.\\n\\nIn summary, this code calculates and returns the `rowIndex`-th row of Pascal\\'s Triangle using a list-based approach, where each row is calculated based on the previous row. It builds up the rows one by one, starting with the first row as `[1]` and using the values from the previous row to calculate the next row.\\n\\n# Python Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:\\n        res = [[1]]\\n        \\n        for i in range(rowIndex):\\n            temp = [0] + res[-1] + [0]\\n            row = []\\n\\n            for j in range(len(res[-1])+1):\\n                row.append(temp[j] + temp[j+1])\\n            res.append(row)\\n\\n        return res[-1]\\n```\\n**Please upvote if you like the solution & feel free to give your opinion. \\nHappy Coding! \\uD83D\\uDE0A**",

Iterative \\n* Same approach as the recursive solution, but implemented in an iterative way.\\n* Time Complexity: `O(n^2)` where `n = rowIndex`\\n\\t* Two nested `O(n)` for loops\\n* Space Complexity: `O(n)` \\n\\t* Stores only the required row.\\n\\n```\\n    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:\\n        row = [1]*(rowIndex+1)\\n        for i in range(1, rowIndex):\\n            for j in range(i, 0, -1):\\n                row[j] = row[j-1]+row[j]\\n        return row\\n```\\n\\n## Solution #3 - Using Binomial Coefficients\\n* `nCr = C(n, r)` = number of ways to choose `r` items from a set of `n` items (amonth many other interpretations)\\n* `iCj = C(i, j)` is the `j`th element in the `i`th row of the pascal triangle\\n* Time Complexity: `O(n)` where `n = rowIndex`\\n\\t* We directly compute elements of the required row\\n* Space Complexity: `O(n)` \\n\\t* Stores only the required row.\\n* We compute `nCr = n!/(r!*(n-r)!) = (n * n-1 * n-2 * ....) / (1 * 2 * 3 * ...)`\\n```\\n    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        using C(n, r) = n!/(r!*(n-r)!)\\n        row-0: C(0,0)\\n        row-1: C(1,0) C(1,1)\\n        row-2: C(2,0) C(2,1) C(2,2)\\n        row-3: C(3,0) C(3,1) C(3,2) C(3,3)\\n        row-4: C(4,0) C(4,1) C(4,2) C(4,3) C(4,4)\\n        \\'\\'\\'\\n        answer = [1]\\n        numerator = rowIndex\\n        denominator = 1\\n        while numerator:\\n            answer.append(answer[-1] * numerator//denominator)\\n            denominator += 1\\n            numerator -= 1\\n        return answer\\n```\\n* To write the same thing in a more compact way:\\n```\\n    def getRow(self, R: int) -> List[int]:\\n        row = [1]\\n        for i in range(R):\\n            row.append(row[-1]*(R-i)//(i+1))\\n        return row\\n```\\n\\n## Solution #4 - Pairwise Sum of two lists\\n* Pairwise sum of two lists is denoted by # below\\n* We can generate a row from the previous row in the following way:\\n\\t* Row#0  `[1]`\\n\\t* Row#1  `[0,1] # [1,0] = [1,1]`\\n\\t* Row#2  `[0,1,1] # [1,1,0] = [1,2,1]`\\n\\t* Row#3  `[0,1,2,1] # [1,2,1,0] = [1,3,3,1]`\\n\\t* Row#4  `[0,1,3,3,1] # [1,3,3,1,0] = [1,4,6,4,1]`\\n\\t* and so on .......\\n* Time Complexity: `O(n^2)` where `n = rowIndex`\\n\\t* We are essentially computing all previous rows to arrive to the required row\\n* Space Complexity: `O(n)` \\n\\t* Needs storage for two (or three) lists of `O(n)` length each.\\n\\n```\\n    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:\\n        row = [1]\\n        for _ in range(rowIndex): \\n            row = [x+y for x, y in zip([0]+row, row+[0])]\\n        return row\\n```\\n## Solution#5 - Using the Power of 1000...0001\\n* Every row of the pascal triangle has an interesting relationship with powers of 11, 101, 1001, etc.\\n* This allows us to generate the row using the power `100..001^rowIndex`\\n* Let\\'s take an example:\\n\\t* `rowIndex = 6`\\n\\t* `num = 10^6+1 = 1000001`\\n\\t* `string = num^6 = 1000001^6 = 1000006000015000020000015000006000001`\\n\\t* Split this string into chunks of length `6` from the end (leaving the leading 1 alone)\\n\\t* chunks: `1 000006 000015 000020 000015 000006 000001`\\n\\t* convert these chunks to integers: `1 6 15 20 15 6 1`\\n\\t* This gives us the pascal triangle row #6\\n* Time Complexity: `O(n^2)` where `n = rowIndex`\\n\\t* We are directly computing the elements of the required row\\n\\t* However, we have to process a string of length `1+n^2`\\n* Space Complexity: `O(n^2)` \\n\\t* To store the string of length `1+n^2`\\n* *Note:* Complexity of computing `(1+10^n)^n` renders this solution inefficient and impractical.\\n```\\n    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:\\n        if rowIndex == 0 : return [1]\\n        num = 10**rowIndex+1\\n        string = str(num**rowIndex)\\n        row = [1]\\n        # for j in range(1, len(string), rowIndex):\\n        #     row.append(int(string[j:j+rowIndex])\\n        # return row\\n        return [1] + [int(string[j:j+rowIndex]) for j in range(1, len(string), rowIndex)]\\n```\\n\\n### A Possible Solution using 11^n ???\\n**THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION, IT\\'S STILL JUST AN IDEA**\\n* It\\'s a well known fact that every row of pascal triangle corresponds to a power of 11.\\n\\t* Row#0 `11^0 = 1`\\n\\t* Row#1  `11^1 = 11`\\n\\t* Row#2  `11^2 = 121`\\n\\t* Row#3  `11^3 = 1331`\\n\\t* Row#4  `11^4 = 14641`\\n* However things get tricky beyond this. You have to carry over the digits other than the unit digit to the previous element and so on.\\n\\t* Row#5 `1 5 10 10 5 1 >> 161051 = 11^5`\\n* If this process is reversible, it may allow us to compute the `n`th row using the digits of `11^n`.\\n* We have to only compute the first `n/2` numbers.\\n* Following is my attempt to figure this out that works only till `n=7` after which it produces incorrect results. If someone can figure it out, please post in comments. I am unlikely to spend more time on this problem.\\n```\\n    # WORK IN PROGRESS\\n\\t# Following works only upto rowIndex = 7\\n    def getRow_power11(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:\\n        row = []\\n        power11 = 11**rowIndex\\n        for _ in range(1+rowIndex//2):\\n            a = power11%10\\n            power11 = power11//10\\n            # TODO: figure out a way to adjust the \"a\" by borrowing from higher digits\\n            while len(row) > 1 and (a - row[-1]) < (row[-1] - row[-2]):\\n                a += 10\\n                power11 -= 1\\n            row.append(a)\\n        return row + row[:rowIndex//2][::-1]    \\n```\\n\\n*Comments and feedback are welcome*",

Pascal\\'s triangle is a triangle of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first two rows are always `[1]` and `[1,1]`. We can use this information to generate subsequent rows until we reach the desired row.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Initialize a `triangle` list with the first two rows of Pascal\\'s triangle: `[[1],[1,1]]`.\\n2. Check if `rowIndex` is 0 or 1, and return the corresponding row if it is.\\n3. Initialize an empty list `curr` to store the current row, and a list `prev` to store the previous row.\\n4. Use a while loop to iterate from 2 to `rowIndex`, inclusive.\\n5. For each iteration, use a for loop to iterate from 0 to `i+1`, where `i` is the current row index.\\n6. If `j` (the current column index) is 0 or `i`, append 1 to `curr`.\\n7. Otherwise, append the sum of the two numbers directly above (`prev[j-1]` and `prev[j]`) to `curr`.\\n8. Set `prev` to `curr`, and reset `curr` to an empty list.\\n9. Return `prev`.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(rowIndex^2)$$\\n- Space complexity: $$O(rowIndex)$$\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:\\n        triangle = [[1],[1,1]]\\n        if rowIndex==0:\\n            return triangle[0]\\n        if rowIndex==1:\\n            return triangle[1]\\n        curr = []\\n        prev = [1,1]\\n        i = 2\\n        while i<=rowIndex:\\n            for j in range(i+1):\\n                if j==0 or j==i:\\n                    curr.append(1)\\n                else:\\n                    curr.append(prev[j-1]+prev[j])\\n            prev = curr\\n            curr = []\\n            i+=1\\n        return prev\\n```",

Create an ArrayList named result to store the elements of the row.\\n2. Handle the edge case where rowIndex is less than 0 by returning an empty list.\\n3. Add the first element, which is always 1, to the result list.\\n4. Iterate from row 1 to rowIndex (inclusive):\\n- Within each row, iterate backwards starting from the second-to-last element to the first element.\\n- Update each element by setting it to the sum of the current element and the next element in the result list.\\n- This operation effectively calculates the value at each position in the current row using the values from the previous row.\\n5.

Return the result list.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe time complexity of the code is O(rowIndex^2). This is because for each row from 1 to rowIndex, the inner loop iterates from the second-to-last element to the first element, which takes roughly rowIndex/2 iterations on average. Therefore, the overall time complexity is proportional to the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + rowIndex, which is equivalent to rowIndex * (rowIndex + 1) / 2, resulting in O(rowIndex^2) time complexity.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe space complexity is O(rowIndex) since the size of the result list is equal to rowIndex + 1, which stores the elements of the generated row. The additional space required is negligible compared to the size of the result list, making the space complexity O(rowIndex).  \\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public List<Integer> getRow(int rowIndex) {\\n        ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Integer>();\\n        if (rowIndex < 0)\\n            return result;\\n        result.add(1);\\n        for (int i = 1; i <= rowIndex; i++) \\n        {\\n            for (int j = result.size() - 2; j >= 0; j--) \\n            {\\n                result.set(j + 1, result.get(j) + result.get(j + 1));\\n            }\\n            result.add(1);\\n        }\\n        return result;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

So here is the explanation-\\npascle triangle actually represent coefficients of  biionomial expention\\nso lets take a example to understand how\\nhere when i talk about power it means sum of power of **a** and **b**\\n\\nlets take x(row index) =0, which is equal to (a+b)^0 which is equal to 1 and as total power will be zero , so only 1 way to represent it.\\n\\nlets take x =1, which is equal to ((a+b)^0) *(a+b) and as we know it will be [1,1]  as now we want to represent power 1 and it can either be done as \\'a\\' or \\'b\\'.\\n\\nlets  take x=2, which is (a+b)(a+b), now as we want to represent power 2, we can do it by  a^2, ab,b^2. we have already got [1,1] for (a+b) and now we want a^2 so it can only possible if we take \\'a\\' from (a+b) and it can be done in only one way. For \\'ab\\' we  can take \\'a\\'from (a+b) and then b from next (a+b) or \\'b\\' from (a+b) and then \\'a\\' from next (a+b). We can get b^2 same way as a^2.  So answer is [1,2,1]\\n\\nlets take x=3, which is (a+b)^2(a+b). as we already got [1,2,1] from (a+b)^2. Now we want to represent power 3 and it can be done as a^3,a^2b,ab^2,b^3. Now to represent a^3, we need a^2 from (a+b)^2 and it can be done in only one way, for a^2b we can done it by using following combinations (ab,a), (a^2,b). as \\'ab\\' can be represented by 2 ways in (a+b)^2. So, total 3 ways for a^b. After, that we can take similar action to get other values.\\n\\nHonestly when I solve this question I did not solve it by using this explanation. I have solved some \\'find next number in series\\' aptitude  questions in past  and I applied same logic in it and came with this formula. Then i thought of some logical reason and find its just binomial coefficients.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<int> getRow(int r) {\\n        vector<int>v(r+1,0);\\n        long long x=1,n=r;\\n        for(int i=0;i<=r/2;i++,n--){\\n             v[i]=x;\\n             v[r-i]=x;\\n             x=x*n/(i+1);\\n         }\\n        return v;\\n       \\n    }\\n};\\n",

The equation to figure out the pascal\\'s triangle value at a given index is number * (i-j)/(j+1), where number is initialized to 1 within the first for loop. It would eliminate the need to create a multidimensional array, and could reduce your space complexity, as well as make your answer less easy to break.\\n\\nTo answer your question, I think the issue is that the previous problem was base-1, and this one is base-0, causing your previous grabbing of array values to need tweaking.

It would eliminate the need to create a multidimensional array, and could reduce your space complexity, as well as make your answer less easy to break.\\n\\nTo answer your question, I think the issue is that the previous problem was base-1, and this one is base-0, causing your previous grabbing of array values to need tweaking.

If it\\'s a new element, just add this pair to the dictionary\\n3.

Create a defaultdict where values are lists with indices of respective elements.\\n2. Then take values that have length of more than 1. It means that a respective number has duplicates. It is saved in ```indices``` that is a list of lists.\\n3. Then I go through every list in this list of lists and check whether there are elements such that when you subtract one from another, the result is ```<= k```.\\n\\n```\\ndef containsNearbyDuplicate_default(nums, k):\\n    if len(nums) <= 1: return False \\n    if len(set(nums)) == len(nums): return False\\n    d = defaultdict(list)\\n    for ix, v in enumerate(nums):\\n        d[v].append(ix)\\n    indices = [v for v in d.values() if len(v) > 1]\\n    for ind in indices:\\n        return True if any(abs(ind[i] - ind[i + 1]) <= k for i in range(len(ind) - 1)) else False\\n```\\n\\n**Solution 3**:\\n1. Start adding elements to the set.\\n2. If you encounter an element that is already in the set, check whether the absolute difference between the index of this element and ```nums.index(nums[i]) <= k.``` If it is, return True. Otherwise, you need to substitute the element at index ```nums.index(nums[i])``` with ```-math.inf``` and keep going. The idea is that ```index()``` returns the index of a first occurance of the element, and you don\\'t longer want to consider this element and its index going forward. \\n3.

                "content": "I\\'ll go from an unimproved to the improved version.\\n\\nMain Idea (2-pass) -\\n* Store the indices of same nums[i] and compare them.\\n* **We need to only compare the adjacent ones as we need abs(i-j) less than/equal to k. Having to compare values which are not adjacent will only give a worse answer.**\\n* Thus we can store a map of vectors, where a value will point to the different indices, stored in a vector. In other words, we need to have a `map<int, vector<int>>`  and then iterate compute for all adjacent elements of different vectors in the map.\\n* Time Complexity : `O(n)` Since the **size of all vectors which we are iterating sums up to the actual size of the array.**\\n* Space Complexity : `O(n)` Additional space due to the map used.\\n\\nCode :\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool containsNearbyDuplicate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {\\n\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n\\n        map<int, vector<int>> mp;\\n        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) \\n            mp[nums[i]].push_back(i);\\n        \\n        map<int, vector<int>> :: iterator itr;\\n        \\n        for(itr = mp.begin(); itr != mp.end(); itr++) {\\n            int sz = (itr->second).size();\\n            for(int i=0; i<sz-1; i++)\\n                if(abs(itr->second[i] - itr->second[i+1]) <= k)\\n                    return true;\\n        }\\n        \\n        return false;\\n    }\\n        \\n};\\n```\\n\\nIdea for (1-pass) Solution :\\n* Since we only need to compare adjacent values and indices are increasing as we traverse ahead, **it is only required to store the greatest index of num[i] encountered till then.** Thus, `mp[nums[i]] = idx;`\\n* If we encounter the the same element with different index we just calculate `abs(i - mp[num[i]])`. If it is `<= k` return `true`, else we just update the map with `i` for next comparison.\\n* Time Complexity : `O(nlogn)`. **One Pass is needed. + We need to check .find() which is logarithmic. in a map**\\n* Space Complexity : `O(n)`. Size of the map equal total number of unique numbers. \\n\\nCode :\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool containsNearbyDuplicate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {\\n\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n        \\n        map<int, int> mp;\\n        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {\\n\\t\\t\\t// element already exists\\n\\t\\t\\t// check takes O(logn) in a map and O(1) in unordered map \\n            if(mp.find(nums[i]) != mp.end()) {\\n                if(abs(mp[nums[i]] - i) <= k)\\n                    return true; // condition satisfied\\n                else\\n                    mp[nums[i]] = i;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t// just update with latest index for next check.\\n            }\\n            \\n\\t\\t\\t// adding new element\\n            else \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmp[nums[i]] = i; \\n        }\\n        \\n        return false;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nFinal Optimization Step -\\n**Likewise, we can use `unordered map<int, int>` in the 1-pass case and Time Complexity reduces to `O(n)`.**",

I went with map because of constant search time!\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nFor every element, we check if it is already present in the map. \\nIf it is not, we add it with the element being the key and the index being the value.\\nOtherwise, we check if the difference between the indices is less than K.

So you can quickly use this trick to bypass the long code execution time.\n\n---\nLet's start with the 3rd example:\n-->given: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2\n-->conditions: nums[i]==nums[j], abs(i-j)<=k\n\nnums: [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\nindex:   0    1     2     3     4     5\n---\n\n                    [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\n                    [0---------------------->4     5]\n> We can start a loop1:  index 0 to index 4\n\n                    [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\n                    [0     1---->2     3     4     5]\n> We will start another inner loop2: index 1 to index 2\n\n> `i` as index counter for loop1, `j` as index counter for loop2.\n\n> Since we're using index value in both loops we don't want to compare the numbers with itself i.e. at index 0 both loops will have the same values if i=j. So loop2 will always start from 1 step ahead. Again at last index of `nums` loop2 and loop1 will have the same indices so loop1 has a range of `(0,len(nums)-1)`.\n\n> `max index of loop2` is `i1=(index of loop1 at any moment)+2`.

Here `i1=4+2` which will give 6 with an error `index out of range`.\n..................................\nloop1 at index 4\nloop2: 5-->6\n\n> Till index 3 in loop1 we've maintained the condition `index of loop2 - index of loop1=2`. At index 4 for we still want i1 to be 5 i.e. `len(nums)-1`.\n\n> So we can use `i1=min((index of loop1+2), len(nums)-1)`. This way our loop2 will never get out of the index.\n\n> If someone is wondering what about `abs(i-j)<=k` then we know loop2 will always have greater indices so `abs(i-k)` is basically `index of loop2 - index of loop1`. Till index 3 in loop1 `index of loop2 - index of loop1=2`. But at index 4 `index of loop2 - index of loop1=1`  e.g. 5-4=1 since we've limited our loop2 index to `len(nums)-1`. Thus the value of `abs(i-j)` in our case will be equal to k and then it'll start decreasing and eventually end at 1.\n\n> Now in loop2 we can compare values using both loop1's and loop2's indices i.e. `if nums[i]==nums[j]` and return True.\n\n> If the loop1 runs till it's max range i.e. `len(nums)-1` then we're sure that there's no duplicate values.

Most of the time the testcase will just through a huge sequential series e.g. -10001, -10000, -9999, -9998..... So you can quickly use this trick to bypass the long code execution time.\n\n---\nLet's start with the 3rd example:\n-->given: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2\n-->conditions: nums[i]==nums[j], abs(i-j)<=k\n\nnums: [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\nindex:   0    1     2     3     4     5\n---\n\n                    [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\n                    [0---------------------->4     5]\n> We can start a loop1:  index 0 to index 4\n\n                    [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\n                    [0     1---->2     3     4     5]\n> We will start another inner loop2: index 1 to index 2\n\n> `i` as index counter for loop1, `j` as index counter for loop2.\n\n> Since we're using index value in both loops we don't want to compare the numbers with itself i.e. at index 0 both loops will have the same values if i=j. So loop2 will always start from 1 step ahead. Again at last index of `nums` loop2 and loop1 will have the same indices so loop1 has a range of `(0,len(nums)-1)`.\n\n> `max index of loop2` is `i1=(index of loop1 at any moment)+2`. Thus when loop1 starts from index 0 loop2 will have a range of `((index of loop1)+1,i1+2)`.\n..................................\nloop1 at index 0\nloop2: 1-->2\n..................................\nloop1 at index 1\nloop2: 2-->3\n..................................\nloop1 at index 2\nloop2: 3-->4\n\n> Now what would happen if loop1 is at index 4? Here `i1=4+2` which will give 6 with an error `index out of range`.\n..................................\nloop1 at index 4\nloop2: 5-->6\n\n> Till index 3 in loop1 we've maintained the condition `index of loop2 - index of loop1=2`. At index 4 for we still want i1 to be 5 i.e. `len(nums)-1`.\n\n> So we can use `i1=min((index of loop1+2), len(nums)-1)`. This way our loop2 will never get out of the index.\n\n> If someone is wondering what about `abs(i-j)<=k` then we know loop2 will always have greater indices so `abs(i-k)` is basically `index of loop2 - index of loop1`. Till index 3 in loop1 `index of loop2 - index of loop1=2`. But at index 4 `index of loop2 - index of loop1=1`  e.g. 5-4=1 since we've limited our loop2 index to `len(nums)-1`. Thus the value of `abs(i-j)` in our case will be equal to k and then it'll start decreasing and eventually end at 1.\n\n> Now in loop2 we can compare values using both loop1's and loop2's indices i.e. `if nums[i]==nums[j]` and return True.\n\n> If the loop1 runs till it's max range i.e. `len(nums)-1` then we're sure that there's no duplicate values. So we'll return False at the end.\n\n---\nFinal structure:\n---\nuse variable1 to store length of nums\ncompare if variable1 is same with len(set(nums))\n...........return False\nuse i as index counter for loop with range(0,varibale1)\n...........find max limit for j using min\n...........use j as index counter in range(i+1,max limit+1)\n......................compare if both loops have the same values\n......................return True\nreturn False\n\nHope it helps,\nThank you :)"

So you can quickly use this trick to bypass the long code execution time.\n\n---\nLet's start with the 3rd example:\n-->given: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2\n-->conditions: nums[i]==nums[j], abs(i-j)<=k\n\nnums: [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\nindex:   0    1     2     3     4     5\n---\n\n                    [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\n                    [0---------------------->4     5]\n> We can start a loop1:  index 0 to index 4\n\n                    [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\n                    [0     1---->2     3     4     5]\n> We will start another inner loop2: index 1 to index 2\n\n> `i` as index counter for loop1, `j` as index counter for loop2.\n\n> Since we're using index value in both loops we don't want to compare the numbers with itself i.e. at index 0 both loops will have the same values if i=j. So loop2 will always start from 1 step ahead. Again at last index of `nums` loop2 and loop1 will have the same indices so loop1 has a range of `(0,len(nums)-1)`.\n\n> `max index of loop2` is `i1=(index of loop1 at any moment)+2`. Thus when loop1 starts from index 0 loop2 will have a range of `((index of loop1)+1,i1+2)`.\n..................................\nloop1 at index 0\nloop2: 1-->2\n..................................\nloop1 at index 1\nloop2: 2-->3\n..................................\nloop1 at index 2\nloop2: 3-->4\n\n> Now what would happen if loop1 is at index 4? Here `i1=4+2` which will give 6 with an error `index out of range`.\n..................................\nloop1 at index 4\nloop2: 5-->6\n\n> Till index 3 in loop1 we've maintained the condition `index of loop2 - index of loop1=2`. At index 4 for we still want i1 to be 5 i.e. `len(nums)-1`.\n\n> So we can use `i1=min((index of loop1+2), len(nums)-1)`. This way our loop2 will never get out of the index.\n\n> If someone is wondering what about `abs(i-j)<=k` then we know loop2 will always have greater indices so `abs(i-k)` is basically `index of loop2 - index of loop1`. Till index 3 in loop1 `index of loop2 - index of loop1=2`. But at index 4 `index of loop2 - index of loop1=1`  e.g. 5-4=1 since we've limited our loop2 index to `len(nums)-1`. Thus the value of `abs(i-j)` in our case will be equal to k and then it'll start decreasing and eventually end at 1.\n\n> Now in loop2 we can compare values using both loop1's and loop2's indices i.e. `if nums[i]==nums[j]` and return True.\n\n> If the loop1 runs till it's max range i.e. `len(nums)-1` then we're sure that there's no duplicate values. So we'll return False at the end.\n\n---\nFinal structure:\n---\nuse variable1 to store length of nums\ncompare if variable1 is same with len(set(nums))\n...........return False\nuse i as index counter for loop with range(0,varibale1)\n...........find max limit for j using min\n...........use j as index counter in range(i+1,max limit+1)\n......................compare if both loops have the same values\n......................return True\nreturn False\n\nHope it helps,\nThank you :)"

                        "content": "*** If you're getting `Time Limit Exceeded` then you can compare `len(set(nums))` with `len(nums)`. Most of the time the testcase will just through a huge sequential series e.g. -10001, -10000, -9999, -9998..... So you can quickly use this trick to bypass the long code execution time.\n\n---\nLet's start with the 3rd example:\n-->given: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2\n-->conditions: nums[i]==nums[j], abs(i-j)<=k\n\nnums: [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\nindex:   0    1     2     3     4     5\n---\n\n                    [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\n                    [0---------------------->4     5]\n> We can start a loop1:  index 0 to index 4\n\n                    [1,    2,    3,    1,    2,    3]\n                    [0     1---->2     3     4     5]\n> We will start another inner loop2: index 1 to index 2\n\n> `i` as index counter for loop1, `j` as index counter for loop2.\n\n> Since we're using index value in both loops we don't want to compare the numbers with itself i.e. at index 0 both loops will have the same values if i=j. So loop2 will always start from 1 step ahead. Again at last index of `nums` loop2 and loop1 will have the same indices so loop1 has a range of `(0,len(nums)-1)`.\n\n> `max index of loop2` is `i1=(index of loop1 at any moment)+2`. Thus when loop1 starts from index 0 loop2 will have a range of `((index of loop1)+1,i1+2)`.\n..................................\nloop1 at index 0\nloop2: 1-->2\n..................................\nloop1 at index 1\nloop2: 2-->3\n..................................\nloop1 at index 2\nloop2: 3-->4\n\n> Now what would happen if loop1 is at index 4? Here `i1=4+2` which will give 6 with an error `index out of range`.\n..................................\nloop1 at index 4\nloop2: 5-->6\n\n> Till index 3 in loop1 we've maintained the condition `index of loop2 - index of loop1=2`. At index 4 for we still want i1 to be 5 i.e. `len(nums)-1`.\n\n> So we can use `i1=min((index of loop1+2), len(nums)-1)`. This way our loop2 will never get out of the index.\n\n> If someone is wondering what about `abs(i-j)<=k` then we know loop2 will always have greater indices so `abs(i-k)` is basically `index of loop2 - index of loop1`. Till index 3 in loop1 `index of loop2 - index of loop1=2`. But at index 4 `index of loop2 - index of loop1=1`  e.g. 5-4=1 since we've limited our loop2 index to `len(nums)-1`. Thus the value of `abs(i-j)` in our case will be equal to k and then it'll start decreasing and eventually end at 1.\n\n> Now in loop2 we can compare values using both loop1's and loop2's indices i.e. `if nums[i]==nums[j]` and return True.\n\n> If the loop1 runs till it's max range i.e. `len(nums)-1` then we're sure that there's no duplicate values. So we'll return False at the end.\n\n---\nFinal structure:\n---\nuse variable1 to store length of nums\ncompare if variable1 is same with len(set(nums))\n...........return False\nuse i as index counter for loop with range(0,varibale1)\n...........find max limit for j using min\n...........use j as index counter in range(i+1,max limit+1)\n......................compare if both loops have the same values\n......................return True\nreturn False\n\nHope it helps,\nThank you :)"
