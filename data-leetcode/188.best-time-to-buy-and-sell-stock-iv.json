We need to merge these two arrays into a single sorted array, and the result should be stored inside nums1. Since nums1 is of size m+n, we can use this extra space to store the merged array. We can iterate through the arrays from the end and place the larger element in the end of nums1.\\n\\n---\\n# Approach : ***Using STL***\\n1.

We will also have another pointer k initialized to m+n-1, which will be used to keep track of the position in nums1 where we will be placing the larger element. Then we can start iterating from the end of the arrays i and j, and compare the elements at these positions. We will place the larger element in nums1 at position k, and decrement the corresponding pointer i or j accordingly. We will continue doing this until we have iterated through all the elements in nums2.

                "content": "### Logic\\nWe\\'d like to attempt this question in-place because all the space we need is already provided by our first array; there\\'s no need to create extra space. We\\'d like to use a two-pointer approach but it can get quite messy dealing with certain cases. Since our extra space starts at the end of the first array, let\\'s see if we can do this by iterating backwards! \\n\\n**Three Pointers:**\\nLet\\'s use three pointers for this operation:\\n* The main pointer, `i`, will be starting from the end of the first array and will work its way to index 0.\\n* The pointer for the first array, `a`, and;\\n* The pointer for the second array, `b`, will be used for comparing the two sorted arrays and deciding what value to place at `i` next.\\n\\nWe\\'ll decide which value at index `a` or `b` is larger, place that value at index `i`, and decrement either `a` or `b` depending on which was larger. This sounds a bit confusing so I\\'ve illustrated below how this would work with two example arrays:\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/c677fb0a-96f3-4738-bbfa-28f6b4e3e97e_1654564101.5492318.png)\\n\\nI hope the above illustration sufficiently details the three pointer approach. In summary, we compare two values, pick the larger one, and move to the next comparison. The reason we move the pointer of the larger value is because we already know that that number is larger than (or equal to) ANY number that comes before it. So we can confidently place it at `i` and move on.\\n___\\n### But won\\'t some values at array A be overridden by the main pointer?\\nGood question! Yes you\\'re right; our `i` pointer will eventually land at values of `A` that are non-zero. Is this a problem? Turns out it isn\\'t. This is because we\\'re guaranteed to have already used those values at `A` before they become overridden. Think about it like this:\\n\\n`A` is of length `m+n`. All our meaningful values are the first `m` values. This means that the last `n` values are empty. Therefore, our `i` pointer needs to process the `nth` largest numbers in both arrays before overriding values at `A`. It\\'s not possible for `i` to override any unused values of `A` by the time it reaches `A`. \\n\\nLet\\'s consider the two extremes:\\n* If the `nth` largest values are all at `A`, our pointer `a` pointer will be moving with `i` so there\\'s no issues there. \\n* If the `nth` largest values are all at `B`, then our `b` pointer will trigger our exit condition \"`b >= 0`\" since our `b` pointer would be negative eventually. Therefore, `i` won\\'t get a chance to override values at `A`. \\n \\nIf this all sounds a bit confusing, don\\'t worry about it! Took me a while to get this explanation in order and if your interviewer expects you to spit this out in an interview, they don\\'t want to hire you haha.  \\n___\\n### Code\\nJust for clarity, the for loop initialises all three pointers and it maintains the `b >= 0` condition that\\'s necessary for our algorithm as aforementioned.\\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or improvements, feel free to let me know.

I\\'ll continue this process until all elements from nums2 are merged into nums1.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(m + n)\\n  The algorithm iterates through both arrays once, where \\'m\\' is the length of nums1 and \\'n\\' is the length of nums2.\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1)\\n  The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables, so the space complexity is constant.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n   public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {\\n        int p1 = m - 1;\\n        int p2 = n - 1;\\n        int pMerge = m + n - 1;\\n        \\n        while (p2 >= 0) {\\n            if (p1 >= 0 && nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]) {\\n                nums1[pMerge--] = nums1[p1--];\\n            } else {\\n                nums1[pMerge--] = nums2[p2--];\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n![c0504eaf-5fb8-4a1d-a769-833262d1b86e_1674433591.3836212.webp](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/8a3b41d1-f0ca-472f-a9f7-8346b34a824e_1693297402.2918687.webp)",

And at last check if  some emlement is left in second array then push that also.\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nTwo pointer can used here by keeping pointers from back and keep decrementing our pointers and keep adding the larger elements in back.\\nNOTE: Since arr1 can accomadate all the elemnts but m is given without zeroes counting so take care of that i.e take `k=m+n-1`\\n**Some confusion that can occur: Why we check if arr2 is empty why not arr1**\\nSince we have to fill the  first array so we only need to cover the second array because if second will be empty we can directly return our first one as its but if first one is empty we have to move second array in first and then return. Since first can\\'t be actually empty but m is given without zeroes counting so when m=0 we might take that as empty so just traverse second wholely. And check the pointer of first array if it has gone to end still there might be some elemnts in arr2.But when pointer of arr2 has gone to end we don\\'t need any comparsion then juut keep the remnaing elemnts as it is .\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:O(N+M)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n**Biginer Friendly Code but SPACE is $$O(N)$$**\\n```\\nvoid merge(vector<int>& arr, int m, vector<int>& arr2, int n) {\\n        int i=0,j=0;\\n        vector<int>v(m+n);\\n        int k=0;\\n        while(i<m and j<n){\\n            \\n           if(arr[i]<arr2[j])v[k++]=arr[i],i++;\\n           else {\\n               v[k++]=arr2[j],j++;\\n           }\\n        }\\n        while(i<m)v[k++]=arr[i++];\\n          while(j<n)v[k++]=arr2[j++];\\n        \\n        for(int i=0;i<m+n;i++)arr[i]=v[i];\\n    }\\n```\\n**Actual Code with O(1) SPACE**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void merge(vector<int>& arr, int m, vector<int>& arr2, int n) {\\n      int i=m-1,j=n-1;\\n      int k=m+n-1;\\n      while(j>=0 and i>=0){\\n          if(arr[i]<arr2[j])arr[k--]=arr2[j--];\\n          else arr[k--]=arr[i--];\\n      }\\n      while(j>=0)arr[k--]=arr2[j--];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n****ONE LINER with same logic only simpler implementation****\\n```\\n void merge(vector<int>& arr, int m, vector<int>& arr2, int n) {\\n      int i=m-1,j=n-1,k=m+n-1;\\n      while(j>=0 ){\\n         arr[k--]=(i<0 || arr[i]<arr2[j])?arr2[j--]:arr[i--];\\n      }\\n    }\\n```",

Also, we need to start from **end** of our lists, and this is essential, if you start from the beginning of lists, you can accidentely rewrite you data, so you need to think where to put it first and it will be extra space.\\n\\nSo, all we do is:\\n1. define `p1 = m - 1` and `p2 = n - 1`: pointers for `nums1` and `nums2`.\\n2. We start from `i = m + n - 1` and move in backward direction: we compare `nums1[p1]` and `nums2[p2]`, write biggest number to `nums1[i]` and move one of the pointers: `p1` or `p2`.\\n3. This is not all: it can happen, that when we reached `p1 = 0`, there are still some numbers we need to copy from `nums2` to `nums1`, and in next step we do this.\\n\\n**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n + m)`, space complexity is `O(1)`: we did everything inplace.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):\\n        p1, p2 = m - 1, n - 1\\n        for i in range(m+n-1, -1, -1):\\n            if p1 < 0 or p2 < 0: break\\n            if nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:\\n                nums1[i] = nums1[p1]\\n                p1 -= 1\\n            else:\\n                nums1[i] = nums2[p2]\\n                p2 -= 1\\n              \\n        while p2 >= 0:\\n            nums1[i] = nums2[p2]\\n            i -= 1\\n            p2 -= 1\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Make a copy of nums1, and then step through the nums1 copy and nums2, from the front, adding whichever is smallest back into nums1.\\n\\nThis obviously will increase memory use, but produces 52ms runtime (i.e 100%).\\n\\n```\\nvar merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {\\n    \\n    if (n == 0) return;\\n    \\n    let nums1copy = [...nums1], mm = 0, nn = 0;\\n    \\n    for (let i = 0; i < (m+n); i++) {\\n        //Is it smaller, or have we run out of the second list?\\n        if ( (nums1copy[mm] < nums2[nn] && mm < m) || nn >= n ) {\\n            nums1[i] = nums1copy[mm];\\n            mm++;\\n        } else {\\n            nums1[i] = nums2[nn];\\n            nn++;\\n        }   \\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Method 3**\\n\\nThis method uses no additional memory and retains the 52ms (100%) runtime.\\n\\nThe biggest problem with starting from the front, is that you run into trouble with overwriting values etc. and it likely won\\'t work.\\n\\nThis method starts from the back - where our \"empty\" spaces are. Similar to method 2, we are basically keeping two pointers, but starting at the back and looking for the bigger of the two numbers instead of the smaller.\\n\\nThe code would be a lot more legible if we simply \"let i = m + n\" but I quite liked the zero memory consumption of this approach.\\n\\n```\\nvar merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {\\n    //we don\\'t want the length, we want the start position of the final elements\\n    m--;\\n    n--;\\n    \\n    while (m + n >= -1) {\\n        //If bigger, or nothing left in nums2, copy it over\\n        if ( (nums1[m] > nums2[n] ) || n < 0) {\\n            nums1[m + n + 1] = nums1[m];\\n            m--;\\n        } else {\\n            nums1[m + n + 1] = nums2[n];\\n            n--;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n",

Is that a good idea? The only way to know for sure is to profile on the hardware of interest, but short of that, we can take a look at the assembly generated by the compiler. Here\\'s that loop again:\\n\\n```c++\\nwhile(n >= 0 && m >= 0){\\n\\tconst int num1 = nums1[m];\\n\\tconst int num2 = nums2[n];\\n\\tnums1[write] = std::max(num1, num2);\\n\\tif(num1 > num2){\\n\\t\\t--m;\\n\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t--n;\\n\\t}\\n\\t--write;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis was an attempt to keep the code inside the branch as short as possible. Let\\'s use Godbolt to see what a compiler (clang trunk in this case) does with that:\\n\\n```\\n.LBB0_2: # =>This Inner Loop Header: Depth=1\\n  movsxd rsi, esi\\n  mov ebp, dword ptr [r9 + 4*rsi]\\n  movsxd rcx, ecx\\n  mov ebx, dword ptr [r8 + 4*rcx]\\n  xor r10d, r10d\\n  xor eax, eax\\n  cmp ebp, ebx\\n  cmovl ebp, ebx\\n  mov ebx, r15d\\n  mov dword ptr [r9 + 4*rbx], ebp\\n  setle r10b\\n  setg al\\n  sub esi, eax\\n  sub ecx, r10d\\n  dec r15d\\n  mov eax, ecx\\n  or eax, esi\\n  jns .LBB0_2\\n```\\n\\nCool, the `std::max` becomes a conditional move:\\n\\n```\\n  cmp ebp, ebx\\n  cmovl ebp, ebx\\n  mov ebx, r15d\\n  mov dword ptr [r9 + 4*rbx], ebp\\n  ```\\n  Going into this, register ebp contains `nums1[m]` and ebx `nums2[n]`. The two registers are compared, one is conditionally moved on top of the other, and then that is written out to memory, all without a branch.\\n\\nNow we have a very simple branch at the source level to update either `m` or `n`:\\n\\n```c++\\nif(num1 > num2){\\n\\t--m;\\n} else {\\n\\t--n;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet\\'s look at what code that generates:\\n\\n```\\n  setle r10b\\n  setg al\\n  sub esi, eax\\n  sub ecx, r10d\\n```\\nAs we go into this, the processor condition codes still reflect the earlier `cmp ebp, ebx` which we used to find the ordering betwen the elements of the two arrays. Now we use the codes again for the two conditional set instructions, `setle` (_set if less than or equal_) and `setg` (_set if greater than_). This gives us either a 0 in register 10 and a 1 in register al, or a 1 in register 10 and a 0 register al. The next two lines then subtract either a 0 or a 1 from the registers holding the values of m and n without any branches being used. \\n\\nNow we can consider what code is generated with the more straightforward formulation of the same loop, not using `std::max` and instead having just a single extra line on each side of the `if` statement. \\n\\n```c++\\nwhile(n >= 0 && m >= 0){\\n\\tconst int num1 = nums1[m];\\n\\tconst int num2 = nums2[n];\\n\\tif(num1 > num2){\\n\\t\\tnums1[write] = num1;\\n\\t\\t--m;\\n\\t} else {\\n\\t\\tnums1[write] = num2;\\n\\t\\t--n;\\n\\t}\\n\\t--write;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the dissassembly below, we jump into it at label `.LBB1_2`. The body of the loop then features a branch `jle` for our `if` statement and a control flow which bounces around a lot more.\\n\\n```\\n.LBB1_22: # in Loop: Header=BB1_2 Depth=1\\n  mov dword ptr [r9 + 4*rax], ecx\\n  dec r10d\\n.LBB1_23: # in Loop: Header=BB1_2 Depth=1\\n  dec eax\\n  mov ecx, esi\\n  or ecx, r10d\\n  js .LBB1_4\\n.LBB1_2: # =>This Inner Loop Header: Depth=1 <----- We enter here from a jump not shown.\\n  movsxd rcx, esi\\n  mov ebx, dword ptr [r9 + 4*rcx]\\n  movsxd rcx, r10d\\n  mov ecx, dword ptr [r8 + 4*rcx]\\n  mov eax, eax\\n  cmp ebx, ecx\\n  jle .LBB1_22\\n  mov dword ptr [r9 + 4*rax], ebx\\n  dec esi\\n  jmp .LBB1_23\\n.LBB1_4:    # Go on to the cleanup loop ...\\n```\\n\\nThis is just the result of one compiler with a particular set of flags. Which of these two is actually faster is still not certain. \\n\\nFull assembly listing on Godbolt [here](https://godbolt.org/z/XqEH9-).\\n",

                "content": "This is not my solution.  It\\'s a tweak of the solution in _Cracking the Code Interview_. But I wanted to share it, since it\\'s clever and I didn\\'t see it mentioned in the top discussions. Everything I saw had more than 2 conditionals or loops, or ternaries that made the solution harder to read.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works.  Instead of starting at the beginning, then having to shift the array over when you\\'ve inserted into the first array, work backwards.  Start at the end of both arrays, you know that the biggest of these two must be the last one in the merged array, so replace the (empty) spot at the end of the merged array, then move your indexes to the left and repeat. Also, keep an index on the current spot to insert at.  Eventually you\\'ll run out of empty spots, and start overwriting spots in `nums1`.  This is OK though, because at the point this happens, all the elements that are bigger than the index at which you\\'re inserting area already present in the array where there used to be empty space!\\n\\nHere\\'s what it looks like at the point we start overwriting values in the first array\\na = 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6\\nb = 1, 2, 6\\naPointer = 3 (index 0)\\nbPointer = 2 (index 1)\\ninsertAt = the first 5 (index 2)\\n\\nThen, we start replacing, and the first replacement will actually be from `a` itself, since it\\'s the next biggest\\na = 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6\\nb = 1, 2, 6\\naPointer = null (index -1)\\nbPointer = 2 (index 1)\\ninsertAt = the first 4 (index 1)\\n\\nThen all that\\'s left is the last 2 (`1` and `2`) from `b`, which replace the first `3` and `4`, giving us the final result.\\na = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\nb = 1, 2, 6\\naPointer = null (index -1)\\nbPointer = null (index -1)\\ninsertAt = null (index -1)\\n\\n```\\npublic void merge(int[] a, int aLength, int[] b, int bLength) {\\n    int aIndex = aLength - 1;  // initialize to the end of a, not including empty space\\n    int bIndex = bLength - 1;  // initialize to end of b\\n    int insertAt = aLength + bLength - 1;  // initialize to end of a, including empty space\\n    while (bIndex >= 0)  // looping over b, because once we\\'re out of b\\'s, the a\\'s remaining are already sorted (since input is sorted)\\n        if (aIndex >= 0 && a[aIndex] >= b[bIndex])  // a >= b\\n            a[insertAt--] = a[aIndex--];  // insert value from a, then shift indexes for a and insert\\n        else  // b < a\\n            a[insertAt--] = b[bIndex--];  // insert value from b, then shift indexes for b and insert\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Analysis**\\n**Time:**\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Worst Case:** O(m + n), we iterate over each of m and n once.\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Best Case:** O(n), we insert b\\'s into a, and they all happen to fit exactly at the end.\\n**Memory:** O(1)\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We introduce 3 variables.

It converts it into an awesome question!\\n\\nThe key idea is to start from the end of the arrays rather than the start. The problem with starting at the start is that we\\'d need to use extra memory (or maintain a circular array in the start of nums2... that is an option I think!).\\n\\nThen, we just keep track of our current reading point in each array, and the current point we are writing into.

This is simple enough; at each index ```i```, we can check the values of ```nums1[m-1]``` and ```nums2[n-1]``` and store the larger one into ```nums[i]```.\\n\\nWhile performing this operation, we need to be aware of edge cases:\\n\\n- If ```n == 0```, we\\'ve successfully merged ```nums2``` into ```nums1```. Hence, we can return straightaway since there is nothing more to be done.\\n- If ```m == 0```, we are only left with ```nums2``` elements to fix. Since we started with largest elements first, we can guarantee that the remaining ```k``` elements in ```nums2``` (where ```k <= n```) are smaller than the rest of the elements we\\'ve previously fixed. Then, since these ```k``` elements are already sorted, **we can insert ```nums2``` at the front of ```nums1``` instantly and be done with the merging**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Code\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:\\n        while m > 0 and n > 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t# Index to append to: len(nums1)-1 = m+n-1\\n            if nums1[m-1] > nums2[n-1]:\\n                nums1[m+n-1] = nums1[m-1]\\n                m -= 1  # Check the next element in nums1\\n            else:\\n                nums1[m+n-1] = nums2[n-1]\\n                n -= 1  # Check the next element in nums2\\n\\t\\t# The remaining k elements in nums2 can just be inserted into the front\\n\\t\\t# If k == 0, nums2 has already been merged, so this for loop is also skipped\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            nums1[i] = nums2[i]\\n\\t\\t# nums1[:n] = nums2[:n]  # one-liner\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Final Result\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/67c4722c-04f8-431f-bfed-74308e153b00_1635134680.1653547.png)\\n\\nPlease upvote if this has helped you!

                "content": "# Intuition:\\nThe problem requires merging two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, into `nums1`. To solve this, we can start from the end of the two arrays and compare the elements. We place the larger element at the end of `nums1` and continue this process until we reach the beginning of either array.\\n\\n# Approach 1:\\n1. Initialize a variable `n2` to store the value of `n`.\\n2. Iterate `i` from 0 to `n` (exclusive).\\n    a. Assign `nums2[n2-1]` to `nums1[m+i]` to merge the elements from `nums2` to `nums1`.\\n    b. Check if `n2` is less than or equal to 0. If true, return from the function.\\n    c. Decrement `n2` by 1.\\n3. Sort `nums1` using the `sort` function to ensure the merged array is sorted.\\n\\n# Complexity Analysis:\\n- Time Complexity: The time complexity of this approach is O((m+n)log(m+n)), where m and n are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. This is because we perform a sort operation on `nums1` after merging.\\n- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional space that grows with the input size. We are performing the merge operation in-place.\\n# Code: \\n\\n### C++\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {\\n        int n2 = n;\\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\\n            nums1[(m+i)]=nums2[n2-1];\\n            while(n2<0){\\n            return;\\n            }\\n            n2--;\\n        }\\n        sort(nums1.begin(),nums1.end());\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n### Java\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {\\n        int n2 = n;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            nums1[m + i] = nums2[n2 - 1];\\n            while (n2 < 0) {\\n                return;\\n            }\\n            n2--;\\n        }\\n        Arrays.sort(nums1);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n### Python\\n```py\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):\\n        n2 = n\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            nums1[m + i] = nums2[n2 - 1]\\n            while n2 < 0:\\n                return\\n            n2 -= 1\\n        nums1.sort()\\n\\n```\\n### JavaScript\\n```js\\nvar merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {\\n    let n2 = n;\\n    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n        nums1[m + i] = nums2[n2 - 1];\\n        while (n2 < 0) {\\n            return;\\n        }\\n        n2--;\\n    }\\n    nums1.sort((a, b) => a - b);\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Optimized Approach:\\n1. We start from the end of both `nums1` and `nums2` arrays and compare the elements.\\n2. We have three pointers: `i`, `j`, and `k`. `i` points to the last element in `nums1`, `j` points to the last element in `nums2`, and `k` points to the last position in the merged array.\\n3. While `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to 0, we compare `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`. We place the larger element at `nums1[k]` and decrement the corresponding pointers (`i`, `j`, and `k`).\\n4. After the above loop, if there are any remaining elements in `nums2`, they should be copied to `nums1` starting from position `k` downwards.\\n5. The merged array in `nums1` is now sorted and contains all the elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.\\n\\n# Optimized Complexity:\\n- Time Complexity: The optimized approach has a time complexity of O(m + n) since we perform a linear scan through both `nums1` and `nums2`.\\n- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as we are performing the merge in-place without using any additional data structures.\\n\\n# Code:\\n\\n### C++\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {\\n        int i = m - 1;  // Index of last element in nums1\\n        int j = n - 1;  // Index of last element in nums2\\n        int k = m + n - 1;  // Index of last element in the merged array\\n\\n        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {\\n            if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {\\n                nums1[k] = nums1[i];\\n                i--;\\n            } else {\\n                nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n                j--;\\n            }\\n            k--;\\n        }\\n\\n        // If there are any remaining elements in nums2, they should be copied to nums1\\n        while (j >= 0) {\\n            nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n            j--;\\n            k--;\\n        }\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n### Java\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {\\n        int i = m - 1;  // Index of last element in nums1\\n        int j = n - 1;  // Index of last element in nums2\\n        int k = m + n - 1;  // Index of last element in the merged array\\n\\n        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {\\n            if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {\\n                nums1[k] = nums1[i];\\n                i--;\\n            } else {\\n                nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n                j--;\\n            }\\n            k--;\\n        }\\n\\n        // If there are any remaining elements in nums2, they should be copied to nums1\\n        while (j >= 0) {\\n            nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n            j--;\\n            k--;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n### Python\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):\\n        i = m - 1  # Index of last element in nums1\\n        j = n - 1  # Index of last element in nums2\\n        k = m + n - 1  # Index of last element in the merged array\\n\\n        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\\n            if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:\\n                nums1[k] = nums1[i]\\n                i -= 1\\n            else:\\n                nums1[k] = nums2[j]\\n                j -= 1\\n            k -= 1\\n\\n        # If there are any remaining elements in nums2, they should be copied to nums1\\n        while j >= 0:\\n            nums1[k] = nums2[j]\\n            j -= 1\\n            k -= 1\\n\\n```\\n### JavaScript\\n```\\nvar merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {\\n    let i = m - 1;  // Index of last element in nums1\\n    let j = n - 1;  // Index of last element in nums2\\n    let k = m + n - 1;  // Index of last element in the merged array\\n\\n    while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {\\n        if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {\\n            nums1[k] = nums1[i];\\n            i--;\\n        } else {\\n            nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n            j--;\\n        }\\n        k--;\\n    }\\n\\n    // If there are any remaining elements in nums2, they should be copied to nums1\\n    while (j >= 0) {\\n        nums1[k] = nums2[j];\\n        j--;\\n        k--;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```",

Starting from the end of both arrays, we compare the last elements of nums1 and nums2, and place the larger element at the end of nums1. We continue this process until we have merged all the elements of nums1 and nums2.**\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n\\n# Approach for this Problem :\\n1. Set indices i, j, and k to m - 1, n - 1, and nums1.size() - 1, respectively.\\n2. While j is greater than or equal to 0, do the following:\\n    - a. If i is greater than or equal to 0 and the element at index i in nums1 is less than or equal to the element at index j in nums2, set the element at index k in nums1 to the element at index j in nums2 and decrement j.\\n    - b.

If they let you, go ahead.\\n\\nThis is the implementation:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type nums1: List[int]\\n        :type m: int\\n        :type nums2: List[int]\\n        :type n: int\\n        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        nums1[:] = sorted(nums1[:m] + nums2[:n])\\n```\\n\\nWhat it does is that slices the array that you want to store it and it will sort both `nums1` and `nums2` with their sizes (`m` and `n`). Thus, will return you the elements from the sorted array and size of it into `nums1[:]`.\\n\\nHope this helps :)",

The larger element is placed at the end of `nums1`, and the respective counter (i or j) is decremented. The loop continues until either `nums1` or `nums2` has been completely merged into `nums1`.\\n\\nAfter this initial merge, if there are still elements left in `nums2`, they are added to the beginning of `nums1`.\\n\\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the approach:\\n\\n1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to the last valid index of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.\\n2. Initialize a counter `counter` to the last valid index of `nums1`.\\n3. While both `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to 0, compare `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`. \\n   - If `nums2[j]` is greater or equal to `nums1[i]`, set `nums1[counter]` to `nums2[j]`, decrement `j` and `counter`.\\n   - Otherwise, set `nums1[counter]` to `nums1[i]`, set `nums1[i]` to 0 (to mark the element as \"used\"), decrement `i` and `counter`.\\n4. If there are still elements left in `nums2`, copy them to the beginning of `nums1`.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n    O(m+n)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n    O(1)\\n\\nThe `time complexity` of the given code is `O(m + n)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. This is because the code iterates through both arrays only once, comparing and copying elements as needed.\\n\\nThe `space complexity` of the code is `O(1)`, as it uses constant extra space for the `i`, `j`, and `counter` variables. The original input array `nums1` is modified in place to hold the merged elements, and no additional data structures are used. Therefore, the space used by the algorithm does not depend on the size of the input arrays.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:\\n \\n        i , j = m-1 , n-1\\n        counter = (m+n)-1\\n        while j >= 0  and i >= 0 :\\n            if nums2[j] >= nums1[i]: \\n                nums1[counter] = nums2[j]\\n                counter -= 1\\n                j -= 1\\n            else:\\n                nums1[counter] = nums1[i]\\n                nums1[i] = 0\\n                counter -= 1\\n                i -=1\\n        \\n        if j >= 0:\\n            for k in range(j+1):\\n                nums1[k] = nums2[k]\\n\\n\\n```",

One pile has some red toys and the other pile has some blue toys. Now, you want to put all the toys together in a big pile, but you want to make sure that the toys are still sorted by their colors.\\n\\nTo do this, you take one toy from the red pile and one toy from the blue pile and put them in the big pile. If the red toy is bigger than the blue toy, you put the red toy in the big pile first. If the blue toy is bigger than the red toy, you put the blue toy in the big pile first.\\n\\nYou keep doing this until you have put all the toys in the big pile. If there are still some toys left in the blue pile, you just put them in the big pile without comparing them to any red toys.\\n\\nThis is kind of like what the code is doing. It takes two arrays of numbers that are already sorted, and puts them together into one big array that is also sorted. It does this by comparing the last number in each array, and putting the bigger number in the big array first. It keeps doing this until all the numbers are in the big array."

The trick is to treat [v1, p2] as the first transaction, and [v2, p1] as the second.

                "content": "Re: [A Concise DP Solution in Java](/topic/8984/a-concise-dp-solution-in-java)\\n\\nIn Problem III (At most two transaction), I try to understand and solve this problem from state machine perspective inspired by this amazing post: https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/30680/share-my-dp-solution-by-state-machine-thinking\\n\\nThen we conclude that we can use constant variable to represent 4 states and get a very concise solution as followed.\\n\\n```java\\n    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {\\n        int buy1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, sell1 = 0, buy2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, sell2 = 0;\\n        for (int price : prices) {\\n            buy1 = Math.max(buy1, -price);\\n            sell1 = Math.max(sell1, buy1 + price);\\n            buy2 = Math.max(buy2, sell1 - price);\\n            sell2 = Math.max(sell2, buy2 + price);\\n        }\\n        return sell2;\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nNow for Problem IV, we can make at most K transaction rather than only two. Why not reuse the idea above? The only edge case is the first buy which has no previous sell. So here we create two int[k + 1] array to use sell[0] as a buffer region. Here is the solution.\\n\\n```java\\n    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {        \\n        int[] buy = new int[k + 1], sell = new int[k + 1];\\n        Arrays.fill(buy, Integer.MIN_VALUE);\\n        for (int price : prices) {\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\\n                buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i], sell[i - 1] - price);\\n                sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i], buy[i] + price);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return sell[k];\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nYes, that's all. While this will TLE for large test case, so it's necessary to add a special case handling to pass that. But don't be confused, the basic idea is only the piece of data above indeed.\\n\\n```java\\n        if (k >= prices.length / 2) { // if k >= n/2, then you can make maximum number of transactions\\n            int profit = 0;\\n            for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++)\\n                if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];\\n            return profit;\\n        }\\n```",

Let (v1, p1) and (v2, p2) denote two successive valley-peak pairs of the prices, respectively. Consider the two cases:\\n\\n- **Case 1**: prices[v1] <= prices[v2] and prices[p1] <= prices[p2]. In this case, if we can conduct one transaction, we will use (v1, p2). If we can conduct two transactions, we will use (v1, p1) and (v2, p2). Equivalently, we can consider (v1, p2) as one transaction opportunity, and (v2, p1) as another transaction opportunity. The key idea is that these two original valley-peak pairs provide two transaction opportunities: (v1, p2) and (v2, p1).\\n\\n- **Case 2**: prices[v1] >= prices[v2] or prices[p1] >= prices[p2]. In this case, if we can conduct one transaction, we will use either (v1, p1) or (v2, p2). If we can conduct two transactions, we will use both (v1, p1) and (v2, p2). That is, these two valley-peak pairs provides two transaction opportunities: (v1, p1) and (v2, p2).\\n\\n**The algorithm consists of two steps:**\\n\\n- **Step 1**: Find all transaction opportunities and record their profits. We use a stack `vps` to store the valley-peak pairs of the stock prices, wherein the valley value is sorted in ascending order. (The valley value at the top of the stack is the largest.)

O(nk) DP solution**\\n\\nFirst let\\'s nail down the state transition function,\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/da3cd218-6f92-43e1-918d-bd01495716e0_1631736468.7804964.png)\\n\\nBtw, some folks could end up with the 3 dimentional form and get a worse solution with time complexity of ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/3e49013a-656a-4ab2-b108-19c15323b99a_1631737013.63085.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/ef615154-bf16-4ee9-8b54-848b25e5144a_1631736807.8626459.png)\\n\\nTo avoid this you should always start deducing your state transition function from lower dimention first. Let\\'s focus on the first transition function. It\\'s easy to translate from the transition function to code:\\n\\n```\\nfor i from 0 to n-1\\n{\\n\\tfor k from 0 to K\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tdp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k]; // if prices[i] is not selected\\n\\t\\tfor p from 0 to i\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\tdp[i][k] = max(dp[i][k] , dp[p-1][k-1] + prices[i] - prices[p]); // if prices[i] is selected\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nwell, this seems still O(k*n^2), why a 2d DP[n][k] ends up being O(k*n^2)? Are we doing any dup operation? \\nYes, we are doing duplicate recalculations in below line, actually prices[i] can be moved out of the formula,\\n\\n`dp[i][k] = max(dp[i][k] , dp[p-1][k-1] + prices[i] - prices[p]); // if prices[i] is selected`\\n\\nequivalently it can be:\\n\\n`dp[i][k] = max(dp[i][k] , max(dp[p-1][k-1] - prices[p]) + prices[i]);`\\n\\nmax(dp[p-1][k-1] - prices[p]), 0<p<i, this max value can be pre-calculated and saved when we iterate i, then we can reduce from O(n) to O(1) \\n\\n\\nThen we get the O(kn) solution:\\n\\n```\\n   for (int k = 1; k <= K; k++) {\\n            int pre_max =  -prices[0];\\n            for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {\\n                dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][k], prices[i] + pre_max);\\n                pre_max =  max(pre_max, dp[i - 1][k - 1] - prices[i]);  // save the max of dp[p-1][k-1]  - prices[p]\\n            }\\n        }\\n```\\n\\nThis is the solution [the top answer](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/discuss/54113/A-Concise-DP-Solution-in-Java) gives.\\n\\n**2. O(n) stack solution**\\n\\nThis question has a non-DP solution which is particular to this question itself. People never too greedy in stock market, some always want to buy at the lowest and sell at the highest point as a long term trade, some want to do short term swing trade and make even more. Bear this in mind, we already know that it is reasonable to collapse v1, p1, v2 ,p2 to v1, p2 when v1< v2 and p1 < p2 in order to make more in one transaction.\\n\\nTake [4, 8, 6, 8, 7, 9, 4, 5] and k=2 as an example, we can list all the possible single transaction we can do and sort the gains in decending order, then try to search the whole list from beginning to end to find the one whose indexes are not conflicting with ones already selected. Obviously this is at lease O(n^2) solution. \\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/07573ae1-860f-4ff7-8c53-7b8133b59249_1631746126.7154567.png)\\n\\nLet\\'s think about a better solution, think about how many pattern that the numbers can fall into, the example we use above does\\'t cover all the patterns, let\\'s pick some better numbers and list the patterns it could have:\\n**there are basically 4 patterns:**\\n \\n```\\n\\tv1    p1       v2    p2\\n\\t\\n\\t4      9       8     12        // v2 >= v1, p2 >= p1, can collapse to (4, 12)\\n\\t\\n\\t4     12       8      9        // v2 >= v1, p2 < p1, can\\'t collapse for now but (4 , 12) be possible to collapse later with the numbers coming after 9\\n\\t\\n\\t8     12       4      9        // v2 < v1, p2 < p1, (4, 9) possible to collapse later, (8, 12) can only be taken as a single transaction\\n\\t\\n\\t8      9       4     12        // v2 < v1, p2 <= p1,   same as above\\n\\t\\n```\\n\\nThis is kind of like[ longest valid parenthesis match](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/discuss/1424432/0-ms-faster-than-100.00-of-C%2B%2B-homework-for-the-Sophomore-in-computer-science), where we use stack to collapse a pair of \\'(\\', \\')\\' to nothing.\\n\\nLet\\'s try to use stack to process each prices[i] and try to collapse the new prices[i] with the old prices[i-1] on the top of stack: \\n\\n\\n```\\n\\t(v1    p1)    (v2    p2)       // (v1, p1) is on the top of the stack, (v2, p2) is the current pair under processing\\n\\t\\n\\t4      9       8     12        // v2 >= v1, p2 >= p1, collapse into one new pair, pop out the top to vector, push in the new pair \\n\\t\\n\\t4     12       8      9        // v2 >= v1, p2 < p1, push in the current pair \\n\\t\\n\\t8     12       4      9        // v2 < v1, p2 < p1, pop out the top to vector, push in the current pair\\n\\t\\n\\t8      9       4     12        // v2 < v1, p2 <= p1,   same as above\\n\\t\\n```\\n\\nCan the above stack solution work? No. the conflicting index issue is still there. We need solve it.\\n\\nNow we come to the core of this solution, there is one trick we need to leverage, that is, \\n\\nFor example we have a lengthy sequence of pairs which can fall into the first \"collapse\" pattern:\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/5da7f6d5-9292-4ede-a826-83bc4d167151_1631751810.962142.png)\\n\\nthe following equation is always true:\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/669a5ec2-90bf-4f5a-8a77-2d4ec4f8404e_1631750814.7802377.png)\\n\\nit is true also for partial sum: \\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/2bf1ced7-57d5-4c33-a932-4fa9817a8ae9_1631750834.9336944.png)\\n\\n\\n**What\\'s the meaning of the equation as above?**\\n\\nThis means we collapse from n to t+1 to get one transaztion, from t to 1 to get another transation, then we can get the sum of these two transactions, we can easily to expand this to 3, 4, or more collapses(transactions), e.g. collapse from n to t, from t-1 to k, from k-1 to m, from m-1 to 1 and so on.\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/aef4f438-d61a-4319-b696-51492ce807f4_1631751432.2669985.png)\\n\\n\\nNow we know when we collapse two pairs (V1, P1) (V2, P2), we need to record the value of (P1 - V2), for example collapse (4, 9) (8, 12) to (4, 12) and keep the value of 9-8 = 1, which can be summed with 12-4 = 8 later when we need to take (4, 9) (8, 12) as two transaction to get more benefit.\\n\\n\\nThis ends up with the implementation in [this answer](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/discuss/54145/O(n)-time-8ms-Accepted-Solution-with-Detailed-Explanation-(C%2B%2B)):\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {\\n\\n        // Step 1: Find out all profit opportunities            \\n        vector<int> profits;\\n        stack<pair<int, int>> vps; // valley-peak pairs\\n        \\n        int v;\\n        int p = -1;\\n        for (;;) {\\n            // find next valley-peak pair\\n            for (v = p+1; (v+1 < prices.size()) && (prices[v] >= prices[v+1]); ++v);\\n            for (p = v  ; (p+1 < prices.size()) && (prices[p] <= prices[p+1]); ++p);\\n            \\n            if (v == p) { // v==p means that both v and p reach the end of the array\\n                break;\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Consider two transactions (v1, p1) (back of the stack) and (v2, p2) (the new-found).\\n            // If prices[v1] >= prices[v2], \\n            // it is meaningless to combine the two transactions.\\n            // Save of profit of (v1, p1), and pop it out of the record.\\n            while ((!vps.empty()) && (prices[v] <= prices[vps.top().first])) {\\n                profits.push_back(prices[vps.top().second] - prices[vps.top().first]);\\n                vps.pop();\\n            }\\n            \\n            // If prices[v1]<prices[v2] and prices[p1]<prices[p2], \\n            // then it is meaningful to combine the two transactions\\n            // update (v1, p1) to (v1, p2), and save the profit of (v2, p1)\\n            while ((!vps.empty()) && (prices[p] >= prices[vps.top().second])) {\\n                profits.push_back(prices[vps.top().second] - prices[v]);\\n                v = vps.top().first;\\n                vps.pop();\\n            }\\n            \\n            // save the new-found valley-peak pair\\n            vps.emplace(v, p);\\n        }\\n        \\n        // save all remaining profits\\n        while (!vps.empty()) {\\n            profits.push_back(prices[vps.top().second] - prices[vps.top().first]);\\n            vps.pop();\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Step 2: Calculate the k highest profits\\n        int ret;\\n        if (profits.size() <= k) {\\n            ret = accumulate(profits.begin(), profits.end(), 0);\\n        } else {\\n            nth_element(profits.begin(), profits.end() - k, profits.end());\\n            ret = accumulate(profits.end() - k, profits.end(), 0);\\n        }\\n        return ret;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n",

I visited a number of resources, watched a number of videos and here is the culmination of everything I have picked so far.\\n\\nThese are all the problems we have in the Buy and Sell Stock set.\\n1.

[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)\\n\\nFirst, we will see how we can come up with a framework which we can apply for all the above problems. A framework which is flexible enough to accomodate any tweaks an interviewer might throw at us in the future. *A framework which exhausts all the possible outcomes and then come up with the best solution*. A recursive solution would be exhaustive but we will use \"states\" for exhaustion in these problems. **We will consider each day and see how many possible \"states\" do we have for each day and then find \"choices\" corresponding to each state.**\\n\\n**Let\\'s talk about the constraints first.**\\n1. `Sell` must be after `Buy`.\\n2. `Buy` must be after `Sell`.\\n3.  Limit on the number of transaction(k), `k>0`.\\n\\n**For each day we have three choices.**\\n1. `Buy`.\\n2. `Sell`.\\n3. `Rest`. Which further has two states.\\n\\t a. `Rest after buy`. Here we are holding the stock. We are not selling or buying. We are just resting.\\n\\t b. `Rest after selling`. Here we are not holding any stocks. We are not selling or buying. We are just resting.\\n\\n**Let\\'s talk about the states now.**\\n1. The day we are on i.e `i`.\\n2. The maximum number of allowed transactions i.e `k`.\\n3. The holding state i.e the resting state we talked about before. This is either `1(holding stock)` or `0(not holding stock)`.\\n\\nNow, we can put all the combinations of these states in a 3D matrix like so :\\n\\n```\\nfor 0 <= i <= n:             // n is the number of days\\n\\tfor i <= k <= k:        // k is the maximum number of transactions\\n\\t\\tfor s in {1,0}:    // s is the rest state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdp[i][k][s] = max(buy,sell,rest)\\n```\\n\\n\\n***For every problem we have to find the `dp[n-1][k][0]`, which is the maximum profit for the maximum number of transactions allowed on the last day.***\\n\\nOne important observation. Why didn\\'t we say **`dp[n-1][k][1]`** instead of saying **`dp[n-1][k][0]`**? because if the resting state `S` is 1, it means we are still holding a stock and the profit cannot be maximum until and unless we are done selling all the stocks we have.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, let\\'s think about what choices do we have for each state and how we can update the \"state\". Let\\'s write our state transition equations. They will be something like this.\\n\\n`dp[i][k][0] = Max(dp[i-1][k][0], dp[i-1][k][1] + prices[i]) // prices is the array of stocks`\\n\\n***This equation corresponds to when you are not holding a stock. You are not holding a stock today because perhaps you didn\\'t have any stocks yesterday which we could sell today or maybe you have stocks that you want to sell today, so at the end of the day we will not be holding any stocks.***\\n\\n`dp[i][k][1] = Max(dp[i-1][k][1], dp[i-1][k-1][0] - prices[i])`\\n\\n***This equation corresponds to when you are holding a stock. You are holding a stock today because perhaps you had stocks yesterday or maybe you want to buy stocks today, so at the end of the day we will be holding stocks.***\\n\\n***This explanation should be clear. If you buy, you need to subtract prices[i] from the profit, and if you sell, you need to increase prices[i] to the profit.***\\n\\n\\nNow, let\\'s talk about the base cases.\\n\\n1. `dp[-1][k][0]  = 0`     **// Because the day starts with 0 and here i is -1**\\n2. `dp[-1][k][1] = -Infinity`  **// Because we can\\'t hold any stocks before the first day**\\n3. `dp[i][0][0] = 0`  **// Because k = 0. There won\\'t be any transactions so the profit will be zero** \\n4. `dp[i][0][1] = -Infinity`  **// Because k = 0. We can\\'t hold any stocks without starting a transaction** \\n\\n\\nSo, to summarize the above base conditions and state transition equations\\n\\n```\\nbase case\\uFF1A\\ndp[-1][k][0] = dp[i][0][0] = 0\\ndp[-1][k][1] = dp[i][0][1] = -infinity\\n\\nstate transition equation\\uFF1A\\ndp[i][k][0] = max(dp[i-1][k][0], dp[i-1][k][1] + prices[i])\\ndp[i][k][1] = max(dp[i-1][k][1], dp[i-1][k-1][0] - prices[i])\\n```\\n\\n\\nNow, let\\'s begin with the problems.\\n\\n1. ***When k = 1***\\n\\nWe will put k = 1 directly in the state transition equations and see for ourselves.\\n\\n```\\ndp[i][1][0] = Max(dp[i-1][1][0], dp[i-1][1][1] + prices[i];\\ndp[i][1][1] = Max(dp[i-1][1][1], dp[i-1][0][0] - prices[i];\\n\\t        = Max(dp[i-1][1][1], 0 - prices[i];  // from the above base case when k is 0\\n```\\n\\nWe can also see that the presence of k when it is 1 does not change the state in any way so, we can simply ignore it.\\n\\n```\\ndp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i])\\ndp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], -prices[i])\\n```\\n\\nWe can write the solution for it like so:\\n\\n```\\nvar maxProfit = function(prices){\\n  let n = prices.length;\\n  let dp = [];\\n  \\n  for(let i=0; i<n; i++){\\n    dp[i] = [];\\n    if(i-1 === -1){\\n      dp[i][0] = 0; \\n        // Explanation\\uFF1A\\n        //   dp[i][0] \\n        // = max(dp[-1][0], dp[-1][1] + prices[i])\\n        // = max(0, -infinity + prices[i]) = 0\\n      dp[i][1] = -prices[i];\\n        // Explanation\\uFF1A\\n        //   dp[i][1] \\n        // = max(dp[-1][1], dp[-1][0] - prices[i])\\n        // = max(-infinity, 0 - prices[i]) \\n        // = -prices[i]\\n      continue;\\n    }\\n    dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i]);\\n    dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i-1][1],  -prices[i])\\n  }\\n  return dp[n-1][0];\\n}\\n```\\n\\n***We can reduce the Space complexity to 0(1) by not constructing the DP matrix as the new state is only related to an adjacent state. So, instead of the DP matrix we can store the states in a single variable. One variable for not holding and one for holding.***\\n\\nCode for that would look something like :\\n\\n```\\nvar maxProfit = function(prices){\\n  let d_i10 = 0;\\n  let d_i11 = -Infinity;\\n  \\n  for(let i=0; i<prices.length;i++){\\n    d_i10 = Math.max(d_i10, d_i11 + prices[i]);\\n    d_i11 = Math.max(d_i11, 0 - prices[i]);\\n  }\\n  return d_i10;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2. ***When k = + Infinity***\\n\\nWhen k is Infinity, k and k-1 are practically the same. We will use that in our state transition equations.\\n\\n\\n```\\ndp[i][k][0] = max(dp[i-1][k][0], dp[i-1][k][1] + prices[i])\\ndp[i][k][1] = max(dp[i-1][k][1], dp[i-1][k-1][0] - prices[i])\\n            = max(dp[i-1][k][1], dp[i-1][k][0] - prices[i]) // k and k-1 are the same\\n```\\n\\nSince, the presence of k is not really impacting the states, we will ignore it.\\n\\n```\\ndp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i])\\ndp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0] - prices[i])\\n```\\n\\nAnd the solution would look like this : \\n\\n```\\nvar maxProfit = function(prices){\\n  let d_ik0 = 0;\\n  let d_ik1 = -Infinity;\\n  \\n  for(let i=0;i<prices.length;i++){\\n    d_ik0 = Math.max(d_ik0 , d_ik1 + prices[i]);\\n    d_ik1 = Math.max(d_ik1, d_ik0 - prices[i]);\\n  }\\n  return d_ik0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n3. ***When k = 2***\\n\\nNow, we need to exhaust the value of k as well. Before this we were ignoring k because it was not impacting our states. We need to hold the states for the second transaction as well along with the first transaction. \\n\\n```\\ndp[i][2][0] = max(dp[i-1][2][0], dp[i-1][2][1] + prices[i])\\ndp[i][2][1] = max(dp[i-1][2][1], dp[i-1][1][0] - prices[i])\\ndp[i][1][0] = max(dp[i-1][1][0], dp[i-1][1][1] + prices[i])\\ndp[i][1][1] = max(dp[i-1][1][1], -prices[i])\\n```\\n\\nThe solution would look like this :\\n\\n```\\nvar maxProfit = function(prices){\\n  let d_i20 = 0;\\n  let d_i21 = -Infinity; // base case for second transaction\\n  let d_i10 = 0;\\n  let d_i11 = -Infinity; //base case for second transaction\\n  \\n  for(let i=0; i<prices.length; i++){\\n    d_i10 = Math.max(d_i10, d_i11 + prices[i]);\\n    d_i11 = Math.max(d_i11,  0 - prices[i]);\\n    d_i20 = Math.max(d_i20, d_i21 + prices[i]);\\n    d_i21 = Math.max(d_i21, d_i10 - prices[i]);\\n   \\n  }\\n  return d_i20\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n4. ***When k = + interger***\\n\\n**Important observation** : A transaction consists of buying and selling, which takes atleast 2 days. Therefore, the effective limit k should not exceed n/2( n is the number of days). If it exceeds, there is no contraint effect which makes k equivalent to +Infinity.\\n\\nThis is the only problem from this set which is a little difficult.\\n\\nSolution would look like this \\n```\\nvar maxProfit = function(k, prices) {\\n    if(prices.length == 0) return 0;\\n    \\n    // When k becomes so much larger than the number of prices we can make transactions whenever.\\n    if(k > (prices.length / 2) ){\\n      let d_ik0 = 0;\\n      let d_ik1 =  -Infinity;\\n      for(let i =0; i<prices.length;i++){\\n        d_ik0 = Math.max(d_ik0, d_ik1 + prices[i]);\\n        d_ik1 = Math.max(d_ik1, d_ik0 - prices[i]);\\n      }\\n      return d_ik0\\n    }\\n    else{\\n        let dp = [];\\n        let size = prices.length;\\n        for(let i=0; i<size; i++){\\n          dp[i] = [];\\n          for(let j=0; j<=k; j++){\\n            dp[i][j] = []\\n            if(i-1 === -1 || j-1 === -1){\\n              dp[i][j][0] = 0;\\n              dp[i][j][1] = -prices[i];\\n              continue;\\n            }\\n            dp[i][j][0] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j][0], dp[i-1][j][1] + prices[i]);\\n            dp[i][j][1] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j][1], dp[i-1][j-1][0] - prices[i])\\n          }\\n        }\\n      return dp[size-1][k][0]\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n5. ***When k = +Infinity with cooldown***\\n\\nWe must wait one day after selling a stock to continue trading. We can write the state transition equations as :\\n\\n```\\ndp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i])\\ndp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-2][0] - prices[i])\\nExplanation: When we choose to buy on day i, the state of i-2 should be transferred instead of i-1\\n```\\n\\nCode would look like \\n\\n```\\nvar maxProfit = function(prices){\\n  let d_ik0 = 0;\\n  let d_ik1 = -Infinity;\\n  let d_ik0_pre = 0;\\n  \\n  for(let i=0;i<prices.length;i++){\\n    let d_ik0_old = d_ik0; \\n    d_ik0 = Math.max(d_ik0 , d_ik1 + prices[i]);\\n    d_ik1 = Math.max(d_ik1, d_ik0_pre - prices[i]);\\n    d_ik0_pre = d_ik0_old;\\n  }\\n  return d_ik0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n6. ***When k = +Infinity with transaction fee***\\n\\nSince now we need to pay some fee for each transaction made, the profit after buying or selling the stock on the i-th day should be subtracted by this amount, therefore the new recurrence relations will be either\\n\\n```\\ndp[i][k][0] = max(dp[i-1][k][0], dp[i-1][k][1] + prices[i])\\ndp[i][k][1] = max(dp[i-1][k][1], dp[i-1][k][0] - prices[i] - fee)\\n\\nor\\n\\ndp[i][k][0] = max(dp[i-1][k][0], dp[i-1][k][1] + prices[i] - fee)\\ndp[i][k][1] = max(dp[i-1][k][1], dp[i-1][k][0] - prices[i])\\n```\\n\\nCode can we written as  :\\n\\n```\\nvar maxProfit = function(prices, fee){\\n  let d_ik0 = 0;\\n  let d_ik1 = -Infinity;\\n  \\n  for(let i=0;i<prices.length;i++){\\n    d_ik0 = Math.max(d_ik0 , d_ik1 + prices[i]);\\n    d_ik1 = Math.max(d_ik1, d_ik0 - prices[i] - fee);\\n  }\\n  return d_ik0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this post.",

Formula is below, its better if we understand this with example. as words dont make sense.\\n                \\n                dp[i][j] = maximum of   a) dp[i][j-1]\\n                                        b) dp[i-1][x] + (prices[j] - prices[x]) (for all x in range of 0 to j-1)\\n                        \\n                        6   4   8   6   8   7   8   9\\n                k = 1   0   0   4   4   4   4   5   6\\n                k = 2   0   0   4   4   6   6  ???      \\n                \\n                for the position  k=2, price = 8.\\n                ??? = max of a) 6\\n                             b) max of (4 + 8 - 7) or ( 4 + 8 - 8 ) or ( 4 + 8 - 6 ) or ( 4 + 8 - 8 ) or ( 0 + 8 - 4 ) [ i.e for all x in range of 0 to j-1, profit from previous transaction till that position x i.e dp[i-1][x] and plus the profit if you buy at position x and sell at position j.(i.e prices[j] - prices[x]).

Merge two consecutive trades or remove a trade to minimise the loss in profit, whichever is smaller\\n3. Repeat until we have k trades left \\n\\nDetailed explanation:\\n\\n1. As a first step, before we try to search for any solution, we can potentially reduce the number of prices we need to look at by observing that it can never be optimal to buy at some price at time t p(t) when the following price p(t+1) is lower than it. Conversely, it can never be optimal to sell at p(t) when p(t+1) is higher. So we can start by removing all \"intermediate\" prices, leaving us a consecutive set of buy and sell price points. Not only does this preprocessing reduce the number of prices, but it makes the next part of the problem much simpler, since buys and sells now have a structural relationship: in our cut-down vector of prices, every p(t) where t % 2 == 0 will be a buy, and every p(t) where t % 2 == 1 will be a sell. This is important, since it means we no longer need to search for entries/exits; we already know where they all will be.\\n2. Now we know that we\\'re constrained by the number of trades we can make. If k >= len(prices)/2, i.e. if we are allowed to make an equal or greater number of trades than the number of trades actually possible, then our optimal solution is simply to sum the difference of the consecutive buys and sells.\\n3. But now consider what happens when this isn\\'t the case. Suppose k trades are permitted, but we have k+1 possible trades from which to choose. To meet the constraint, we need to cull one of the possible trades, which we can do in one of two ways: we can either *merge* two consecutive trades or we can *remove* a trade, If we merge two trades, at best we\\'ll end up with a single trade that was as profitable as the pair of trades we merged; it cannot be more profitable. So we need to find the merge that will incur the least loss of profit.\\n4. The cost of merging two trades, assuming we have the vector p(t), p(t+1), p(t+2), p(t+3) is p(t+1) - p(t) + p(t+3) - p(t+2) - (p(t+3) - p(t)); in other words, the sum of the profit from making the two trades as before, less the profit from merging them together and just performing one trade between p(t) and p(t+3). Simplifying this, we get a cost function of p(t+1) - p(t+2). But merging trades might not be our best option. Suppose instead we decide to remove one. Our cost function here, assuming we buy at p(t) and sell at p(t+1), is just p(t+1) - p(t). So what we want to do is find the minimum from both cost functions, and then either delete one trade or merge two trade, depending on which has least impact on our profit.\\n5. But when we look at the cost functions again, we see they are actually the same thing! One is the difference between a closing sell and the next opening buy; the other is the difference between a sell and the previous buy. So all we actually need to minimise is the absolute difference p(t+1) - p(t) for all p\\n6. And the rest is simple. Starting with the set of all possible trades, we just keep on removing the one with the smallest cost until we are left with k trades.

Therefore we need to generate all the choices in order to compare the profit. As we need to try out all the possible choices, we will use **recursion** and then further optimize it using **Dp** because of overlapping sub-problems. \\n### Recursive Solution:\\n\\n**Approach:(Recursion)**\\n\\n**Step 1:**\\n* Express the problem in terms of **indexes**.\\n* We need to think in the terms of the number of **days**, therefore one variable will be the array index( say ind). \\n* Next, we need to keep in mind the condition that we **can\\u2019t** buy a stock again, that is we need to **first sell** a stock, and then we can buy that again. Therefore we need a second variable \\u2018**buy**\\u2019 which tells us on a `particular day` whether `we can buy or sell the stock`. \\n* And Lastly, we have a cap on the number of transactions that we can make. \\n* Here the initial cap is `K`.We need to always keep in mind this constraint.\\n* So the function is something like - f(ind,buy,cap)\\n\\n **Step 2:**\\n* We need to try out all possible choices at a given `index`.\\n* Every day we have two choices either to **buy/sell**(keeping in mind the cap) or do **nothing** and move to the next day.\\n* When **buy==0**, we can **buy** a stock. \\n* Now if we have the choice to buy that means again we have two choices either `we buy the stock` i.e {**-prices[i] + f(ind+1,1, cap)**} or `we do nothing and move to the next day`  i,e  {0+**f(ind+1,0, cap)**}\\n* When **buy==1**, we can **sell** a stock. \\n* Now if we have the choice to sell that means again we have two choices either` we sell the stock` i.e {**prices[i] + f(ind+1,0, cap)**} or `we do nothing and move to the next day` i,e  {0+**f(ind+1,1, cap)**}\\n\\n **Step 3:**\\n*  As we are looking to **maximize** the **profit** earned, we will return the **maximum** value in both cases.\\n\\n**C++:(Recursion)**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int getAns(vector<int>& prices, int n, int ind, int buy, int cap,vector<vector<vector<int>>>& dp ){\\n        if(ind==n || cap==0) return 0; //base case\\n        if(dp[ind][buy][cap]!=-1) return dp[ind][buy][cap];\\n        int profit;\\n        if(buy==0){// We can buy the stock\\n            profit = max(0+getAns(prices,n,ind+1,0,cap,dp), -prices[ind] + getAns(prices,n,ind+1,1,cap,dp));\\n        }\\n        if(buy==1){// We can sell the stock\\n            profit = max(0+getAns(prices,n,ind+1,1,cap,dp),prices[ind] + getAns(prices,n,ind+1,0,cap-1,dp));\\n        }\\n        return dp[ind][buy][cap] = profit;\\n    }\\n    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {\\n        int n = prices.size();\\n        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n,vector<vector<int>>(2,vector<int>(k+1,-1)));\\n        return getAns(prices,n,0,0,k,dp);\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```\\n****\\n**Time Complexity:** **O(N*2x3)**\\n**Space Complexity:** **O(Nx2*K) + O(N)**\\n****\\n### **Recursive Solution to Tabulation:**\\n\\n**Approach:(Tabulation DP)**\\n* First we declare the **dp** array of size [n+1][2][k+1] as zero.\\n* As we have initialized the array as `0`, we have automatically set the **base** condition i.e `if( ind == n || cap == 0) return 0`\\n* Now, when we are traversing the array in the opposite direction of that of the memoization technique. We will start from ind = n-1 -> ind =0, absolutely in the reverse fashion.\\n* In every iteration copy the recursive code logic.\\n* At last dp[0][0][k] ( maximum profit generated on ith day, when we can **buy** the stock on **0th day** and can have a total **k transactions**) gives us the final answer.\\n\\n**C++:(Tabulation)**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {\\n        int n = prices.size();\\n        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n+1,vector<vector<int>>(2,vector<int>(k+1,0)));\\n        for(int ind = n-1; ind>=0; ind--){\\n            for(int buy = 0; buy<=1; buy++){\\n                for(int cap=1; cap<=k; cap++){\\n                    if(buy==0){// We can buy the stock\\n                        dp[ind][buy][cap] = max(0+dp[ind+1][0][cap], -prices[ind] + dp[ind+1][1][cap]);\\n                     }\\n                    if(buy==1){// We can sell the stock\\n                        dp[ind][buy][cap] = max(0+dp[ind+1][1][cap],prices[ind] + dp[ind+1][0][cap-1]);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return dp[0][0][k];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n****\\n**Time Complexity:** **O(N*2xK)**\\n**Space Complexity:** **O(N*2xK)**\\n****\\n### Tabulation to Space Optimization:\\n* If we see carefully, one thing that we can notice is that: **dp[ind][buy][cap] = max( dp[ind+1][buy][cap] , max( dp[ind+1][!buy][cap])**\\n* So, to calculate a value of a cell of the **dp** array, we need only the **next row** values(say ahead of ind+1).

As we have sold the earlier bought stock, we make one complete transaction, therefore now we update the \\u2018cap\\u2019 variable\\u2019s value to cap-1.\\n\\n***Note:*** Buying and selling a stock together counts as one complete transaction.\\n\\nThe figure below gives us the summary:\\n* ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/836c4112-2e02-4897-a032-e93cd1d5f6dd_1659973966.2007952.png)\\n* ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/f905a58a-fb90-4b80-a878-e8ebf405d870_1659973986.8387861.png)\\n\\n***Step 3:***  ***Return the maximum*** \\n\\nAs we are looking to maximize the profit earned, we will return the maximum value in both cases.\\n****\\n****\\n***Base Cases:***\\n\\n* If ind==n, it means we have finished trading on all days, and there is no more money that we can get, therefore we simply return 0.\\n* If cap==0, it means that we cannot make any more transactions.

In order to convert a recursive solution the following steps will be taken:\\n\\n1. Create a dp array of size [n][2][3]. The size of the input array is \\u2018n\\u2019, so the index will always lie between \\u20180\\u2019 and \\u2018n-1\\u2019. The \\u2018buy\\u2019  variable can take only two values: 0 and 1 and the \\u2018cap\\u2019 variable can only take three variables 0, 1, and 2. Therefore we take the dp array as dp[n][2][3].\\n1. We initialize the dp array to -1.\\n1. Whenever we want to find the answer of particular parameters (say f(ind,buy,cap)), we first check whether the answer is already calculated using the dp array(i.e dp[ind][buy][cap]!= -1 ). If yes, simply return the value from the dp array.\\n1. If not, then we are finding the answer for the given value for the first time, we will use the recursive relation as usual but before returning from the function, we will set dp[ind][buy][cap] to the solution we get.\\n\\n****\\n****\\n***C++ Code:*** \\n****\\n```\\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\\n\\nusing namespace std;\\n\\nint getAns(vector<int>& Arr, int n, int ind, int buy, int cap, vector<vector<vector<int>>>& dp ){\\n\\n    if(ind==n || cap==0) return 0; //base case\\n    \\n    if(dp[ind][buy][cap]!=-1)\\n        return dp[ind][buy][cap];\\n        \\n    int profit;\\n    \\n    if(buy==0){// We can buy the stock\\n        profit = max(0+getAns(Arr,n,ind+1,0,cap,dp), \\n                    -Arr[ind] + getAns(Arr,n,ind+1,1,cap,dp));\\n    }\\n    \\n    if(buy==1){// We can sell the stock\\n        profit = max(0+getAns(Arr,n,ind+1,1,cap,dp),\\n                    Arr[ind] + getAns(Arr,n,ind+1,0,cap-1,dp));\\n    }\\n    \\n    return dp[ind][buy][cap] = profit;\\n}\\n\\n\\nint maximumProfit(vector<int>& prices, int n, int k)\\n{\\n    // Creating a 3d - dp of size [n][2][k+1]\\n    vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n,\\n                                    vector<vector<int>> \\n                                            (2,vector<int>(k+1,-1)));\\n    \\n    return getAns(prices,n,0,0,k,dp);\\n   \\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n\\n  vector<int> prices = {3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4};\\n  int n = prices.size();\\nint k = 2;\\n                                 \\n  cout<<\"The maximum profit that can be generated is \"<<maximumProfit(prices, n,k);\\n}\\n```\\n****\\n****\\n***Output:***\\n****\\nThe maximum profit that can be generated is 6\\n\\n***Time Complexity: O(Nx2x3)*** \\n\\nReason: There are N*2*K states therefore at max \\u2018N*2*K\\u2019 new problems will be solved.\\n\\n***Space Complexity: O(Nx2xK) + O(N)***\\n\\nReason: We are using a recursion stack space(O(N)) and a 3D array ( O(N*2*K)).\\n****\\n****\\n***Steps to convert Recursive Solution to Tabulation one.***\\n****\\nTo convert the memoization approach to a tabulation one, create a dp array with the size [N+1][2][K+1].\\n\\n***Handling the base case:***\\n\\nNow, what the base condition in the recursive relation is:\\n\\n***if( ind == n || cap == 0) return 0***\\n\\nWe handle this in the following way:\\n\\n1. ***ind == n***\\nWhen ind == n, the other two variables: cap and buy can take any value, therefore we can set the following two loops and set dp[n][buy][cap] = 0\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/ea34ce9f-25d8-4425-8b29-16c331914c0c_1659974213.213135.png)\\n\\n2. ***cap == 0***\\nWhen cap == 0, the other two variables: ind and cap can take any value, therefore we can set the following two loops and set dp[ind][buy][0] = 0.\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/09259553-175d-44eb-b5f8-029d73a53119_1659974247.7282832.png)\\n\\n\\nAnother hack is to initialize the entire 3D DP Array as 0.

For each time point, we would like to check whether we can left with more cash if we perform the ```k```th transcation at current time point instead of any previous time point. So ```cash = asset - stock_value``` and asset here is the max asset when we have done ```k-1``` transactions.\\n\\nSecond equation indicates that we might sell at a better(higher) price in time ```i+1```, ```k```th transaction. ```asset[i+1][k]``` stands for current max asset left after ```k``` transcations. And the asset can be increased if we sell stock at current price. So ```asset = cash + stack_value```. And we should use ```cash[i+1][k]``` instead of ```cash[i+1][k-1]``` here because we can only sell a stock in the ```k```th transcation after we have bought it. So the cash we use here should be the cash we are left with after ```k``` transcations.\\n\\nAnd if k > number of time points / 2, we can actually buy and sell as mush as we want.

The **BASE CASE ** are done.\\n\\nThen, we consider the evolution of T[i][j], since the answer we want it: T[k][days]. We can divide the evolution into two cases: \\n\\t\\n\\t1. We do not transact on day j; (So we need not to add on the profit)\\n\\t\\t\\tExpr: T[i][j] = T[i][j-1]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t2. We do transact on day j; (So we need to find out the previous buying day and sell it on day j, to add on the profit)\\n\\t\\t\\tExpr: T[i][j] = T[i-1][m] + P[j] - P[m] (for all 0<m<j)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  = P[j] + max_of_all_m(T[i-1][m] - P[m])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nBy now, we need to take the max of the two expr to update T[i][j]:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tT[i][j] = max(T[i][j-1]  ,   P[j] + max_of_all_m(T[i-1][m] - P[m]))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(for all 0<m<j)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSo the direct solution under this DP is looks like the following:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {\\n        if (k == 0) return 0;\\n        if (k >= prices.size()) {\\n            k = prices.size()-1;\\n        }\\n        if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0;\\n        int days = prices.size();\\n        \\n        vector<vector<int>> T(k+1, vector<int>(days, 0));\\n        \\n        for (int i=1;i<k+1;i++)\\n        {\\n            for (int j=1;j<days;j++)\\n            {\\n                int cur_max = INT_MIN;\\n                for (int m=0;m<j;m++)\\n                {\\n                    cur_max = max(cur_max, T[i-1][m] - prices[m]);\\n                }\\n                T[i][j] = max(T[i][j-1], prices[j] + cur_max);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return T[k][days-1];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nCan we do better? The above code is in (n^2*k)\\n\\nObserve that the process of finding \"maxofallm\" is only related to i and T, and if i is fixed in the outer-loop, it\\'s strictly increasing as j increase. Consequently, we can use only one parameter to storage it, other than re-compute it every time, the resulting code is in O(nk)\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {\\n        if (k == 0) return 0;\\n        if (k >= prices.size()) {\\n            k = prices.size()-1;\\n        }\\n        if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0;\\n        int days = prices.size();\\n        \\n        vector<vector<int>> T(k+1, vector<int>(days, 0));\\n        \\n        \\n        for (int i=1;i<k+1;i++)\\n        {\\n            int max_diff = -prices[0];\\n            for (int j=1;j<days;j++)\\n            {\\n                \\n                T[i][j] = max(T[i][j-1], prices[j] + max_diff);\\n                max_diff = max(max_diff, T[i-1][j] - prices[j]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return T[k][days-1];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\t",

It took me some effort to finally write a `O(n)` version according to his explanation. Well, to be honest, I\\u2019m still a little confused about some bits. Here is my understanding, hoping someone could point out if my thought is right.\\n\\nThe **general idea** is to\\n\\n+ split the `prices` array into several consecutive ascending segments, with valley and peak index denoting the start and end point.\\n+ use a stack to process these segments into all possible profits. \\n+ employ a max heap to find the max `k` profits as the result.\\n\\nThe most challenging part for me is to understand when iterating valley-peak segments, how could we handle two adjacent segments? AKA\\n\\n***How could we find all possible profits?***\\n\\nSuppose we are facing two segments `(v1,p1)` and `(v2, p2)` under the limit `v1 < p1 < v2 < p2`, we would have two possible operations:\\n\\n- buy at v1, sell at p1; buy at v2, sell at p2 ( `p1 - v1 + p2 - v2` )\\n- buy at v1, sell at p2 ( `p2 - v1` )\\n\\nWhat we need to do is to find out which could make more profit. We would meet these situations:\\n\\n`prices[v2] <= prices[v1]`\\n+ it\\u2019s obvious that we\\u2019d better make two transactions: `p1-v1` and `p2-v2`, and `v2` is more possible to make bigger profit. So, we pop out `(v1,p1)` from the stack.\\n\\n`prices[v2] > prices[v1]`\\n+ `prices[p2] < prices[p1]` We\\u2019d better use two transactions `p1-v1` and `p2-v2`, and `v1` is still more possible to make bigger profit. So, we keep `(v1,p1)` in the stack.\\n+ `prices[p2] >= prices[p1]` We are not sure about using one or two transactions to get higher profit, so we push two possible results into the `profits` array. Here comes **the key point**: we push `p2-v1` and `p1-v2` into `profits` array. Why? If we could only use one transaction, `p2-v1` is what we want, and if with two transactions, `p2-v1 + p1-v2` is also the max profit.\\n\\nHere is an example about the key point situation: \\n\\n```ruby\\nprices #=> [ 1, 3, 2, 4 ]\\n\\n# we could get\\n(v1, p1): (0 ,1) \\n(v2, p2): (2, 3)\\n\\n# then push two possible profits\\nprofits << prices[p2] - prices[v1]\\nprofits << prices[p1] - prices[v2]\\n\\nprofits #=> [3, 1]\\n\\n# If k is 1, the top profits is 3\\n# If k is 2, the top profits is 3+1\\n```\\n\\nRuby code (it seems a bit longer as I've implement a max heap manually)\\n\\n```ruby\\n  # Stack and Heap - O(n) + O(klogn)\\n  def max_profit(k, prices)\\n    n       = prices.count\\n    pair    = Struct.new(:v, :p){ def to_a; [v, p]; end }\\n    stack   = []\\n    profits = []\\n\\n    if k > n/2\\n      differences = (1..prices.count-1).reduce([]) {|ar, i| ar << (prices[i] - prices[i-1]) }\\n      return differences.select{|num| num > 0}.reduce(:+) || 0\\n    end\\n\\n    v2, p2 = 0, 0\\n    loop do\\n      break if v2 >= n-1\\n\\n      v2 = (v2..n-2).detect{|i| prices[i] < prices[i+1]}\\n      break if v2.nil?\\n\\n      p2 = (v2+1..n-1).detect{|i| prices[i] > prices[i-1]}\\n\\n      # puts \"v2: #{v2} p2: #{p2}\"\\n\\n      # v2 <= v1\\n      while !(stack.empty?) && prices[v2] <= prices[stack.last.v]\\n        v1, p1 = stack.pop.to_a\\n        profits << prices[p1] - prices[v1]\\n      end\\n\\n      # v2 > v1 && p2 >= p1\\n      while !(stack.empty?) && prices[p2] >= prices[stack.last.p]\\n        v1, p1 = stack.pop.to_a\\n        profits << prices[p1] - prices[v2]\\n\\n        v2 = v1\\n      end\\n\\n      stack << pair.new(v2, p2)\\n\\n      v2 = p2\\n    end\\n\\n    while !(stack.empty?)\\n      v1, p1 = stack.pop.to_a\\n      profits << prices[p1] - prices[v1]\\n    end\\n\\n    # puts \"profits: #{profits.join(',')}\"\\n\\n    heap = PriorityQueue.new profits\\n    k.times.map{ heap.delete_max || 0 }.reduce(:+) || 0\\n  end\\n\\n  class PriorityQueue\\n    # Binary Heap implementation\\n\\n    attr_accessor :num, :array, :block\\n\\n    def initialize(arr = [], &block)\\n      @array = arr.clone\\n      @num   = array.size\\n      @array.unshift(nil)\\n\\n      @block = block || ->(a,b){ a < b }\\n\\n      construct\\n    end\\n\\n    def insert(item)\\n      self.num += 1\\n      array[num] = item\\n      swim(num)\\n    end\\n\\n    def get_max\\n      array[1]\\n    end\\n\\n    def delete_max\\n      return nil if num == 0\\n\\n      max = array[1]\\n\\n      exch(1, num)\\n      self.num -= 1\\n      sink(1)\\n\\n      return max\\n    end\\n\\n    def size\\n      num\\n    end\\n\\n    def empty?\\n      num == 0\\n    end\\n\\n    private\\n\\n      def construct\\n        (num/2).downto(1).each{|i| sink(i) }\\n      end\\n\\n      def swim(k)\\n        while k > 1 && less(k/2, k)\\n          exch(k, k/2)\\n          k = k/2\\n        end\\n        nil\\n      end\\n\\n      def sink(k)\\n        while 2*k <= num\\n          j = 2*k\\n          j += 1 if j < num && less(j, j+1)\\n\\n          break unless less(k, j)\\n\\n          exch(k, j)\\n          k = j\\n        end\\n        nil\\n      end\\n\\n      def less(a, b)\\n        block.call(array[a], array[b])\\n      end\\n\\n      def exch(i, j)\\n        t        = array[i]\\n        array[i] = array[j]\\n        array[j] = t\\n      end\\n\\n      def to_s\\n        puts (1..num).to_a.join(\"\\\\t\")\\n        puts array[1, num].join(\"\\\\t\")\\n      end\\n\\n  end\\n```\\n\\nTime complexity: `O(n + klgn)`",

Let create a dp array (dp[i][k][a])in which the i-th position will tell the maximum profit at the end of i-th day with atmost k transaction. \\n\\t- dp[i][k][a], **i** denotes the day, **k** denotes the maximum number of allowed transactions and **a** denotes whether we have sold or buyes the stocks at the end of the ith day.

                "content": "Before reading this, I suggest you have a try for https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/\\nfirst.\\n\\nMost of the solutions I found are using two status: buy and sell, and maintain the max profit for both, which I somehow found abstract and difficult to understand. If you also think so, this solution may help you understand the question from another perspective.\\n\\nThis is my ans to it:\\nit is obvious that in this question profit = price - cost. So we just need to store the min cost before curernt day, and sell it at the highest price to get the max profit for the 1st transaction.\\n\\nAnd for the second transaction, we need a find another minimum cost, meanwhile keeping the profit from 1st transaction as maximum.\\nTo satisfy this we can just use min(price - profit1) as min cost2.\\n\\n```\\nvar maxProfit = function(prices) {\\n    let cost1 = prices[0];\\n    let cost2 = prices[0];\\n    let profit1 = 0;\\n    let profit2 = 0;\\n    \\n    for(let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){\\n        profit1 = Math.max(profit1, prices[i] - cost1);\\n        profit2 = Math.max(profit2, prices[i] - cost2);\\n        \\n        cost1 = Math.min(cost1, prices[i]);\\n        cost2 = Math.min(cost2, prices[i] - profit1);\\n    }\\n    \\n    return profit2;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nNow back to this question. Let\\'s say we have k = 3. Can we modify the solution above to get the ans?\\n\\nvery simple. we just copy and paste a set of codes for transaction3:\\n```\\nvar maxProfit = function(prices) {\\n    let cost1 = prices[0];\\n    let cost2 = prices[0];\\n\\tlet cost3 = prices[0];\\n\\t\\n    let profit1 = 0;\\n    let profit2 = 0;\\n\\tlet profit3 = 0;\\n    \\n    for(let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){\\n        profit1 = Math.max(profit1, prices[i] - cost1);\\n        profit2 = Math.max(profit2, prices[i] - cost2);\\n\\t\\tprofit3 = Math.max(profit3, prices[i] - cost3);\\n        \\n        cost1 = Math.min(cost1, prices[i]);\\n        cost2 = Math.min(cost2, prices[i] - profit1);\\n\\t\\tcost3 = Math.min(cost3, prices[i] - profit2);\\n    }\\n    \\n    return profit3;\\n};\\n```\\n\\nOne point we observe is that, to determine the min cost for transaction[k], we need to know the profit of transaction[k-1]. \\n\\nNow we convert the copy and paste parts into arrays and a loop. \\n\\n```\\nvar maxProfit = function(k, prices) {\\n    if(prices.length <= 1) return 0;\\n\\t\\n\\t//as we are now using arrays, we also store \"cost0\" and \"profit0\" for easier coding. So we need have k+1 elements.\\n    let costs = Array(k+1).fill(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);\\n    let profits = Array(k+1).fill(0);\\n    \\n    profits[0] = 0;\\n    costs[0] = prices[0];\\n    \\n    for(let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++){\\n        for(let j = 1; j <= k; j++){\\n            profits[j] = Math.max(profits[j], prices[i] - costs[j]);  \\n            costs[j] = Math.min(costs[j], prices[i] - profits[j-1]);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n\\t//from the above loop we also maintain the max profits[k] with different i.

An observation is that as we increase the transaction fee, the number of transactions we take will either stay or the same or decrease, so we can binary search for the transaction fee that results in K transactions. Then we just find the maximum profit we get and then re-add the amount we paid in transaction fees. \\n\\nUnderstanding why this is correct is tricky.\\n\\nLet `f(x)` be the maximum profit with `x` transactions with no transaction fee. We notice that `f(x)` is concave - `f(x + 1) - f(x) <= f(x) - f(x - 1)` (intuitively adding the x+1th transaction will help less than the xth transaction).  When we run `calc` over such a function, we get the global maximum (when what we really want is the value of the function at `f(k)`).  \\n\\nImagine if we could somehow shift the global maximum of `f(x)` to `k`. Then we could just run `calc` over it, find the new global maximum (just the value at k), and un-shift the function. That\\'s where the transaction fee comes in. We create a new function `g(x) = f(x) - fee * x`, where `g(k)` is the maximum point in `g`. Then we can simply run `calc` over `g` and then add `fee * k`. \\n\\nSince our function is concave, we binary search for the transaction fee `mid` that causes a maximum point at `k`. Then we compute the peak at the shifted function and then add `fee * k`. \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:\\n        if not prices: return 0\\n        def calc(cost):\\n            best = (-prices[0], 0)\\n            current = (0, 0)\\n            \\n            for i in range(1, len(prices)):\\n                if prices[i] + best[0] - cost > current[0]:\\n                    current = (prices[i] + best[0] - cost, 1 + best[-1])\\n                if current[0] - prices[i] > best[0]:\\n                    best = (current[0] - prices[i], current[-1])\\n            return current\\n        \\n        l = 0\\n        r = max(prices)\\n        while l < r:\\n            mid = (l + r)//2\\n            if calc(mid)[-1] > k:\\n                l = mid + 1\\n            else:\\n                r = mid\\n            \\n        return calc(l)[0] + l * k\\n```\\n\\nThe function `calc` is essentially https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/, it returns a tuple `(max_profit, n_transactions)`, when given a transaction fee.",

For cases where k<=n/2, Think DP. \\n        \\n        Let\\'s say f(i,j) is the profit with doing at most j transactions until day i.\\n        If you have to calculate f(i, j), thinking logically, there could be two possibilities :-\\n        1. You don\\'t sell/buy anything on this day, i.e. by day number i-1, you have already completed j \\n        transactions. You can quantify this by saying, \"The profit I got by doing at most j transactions by \\n        day number i-1\". As a function that means f(i-1, j).\\n        2. You sold the last share on the ith day, thereby completing j transactions on the ith day. However,\\n        that would mean that you would have bought that share sometime earlier. Let\\'s say you bought that on \\n        day number m. Then you can quantify this by saying, \"The profit I got by doing j-1 transctions until \\n        mth day, then buying a share on the mth day and selling it on the ith day\". The reason for \"j-1 \\n        transactions until the mth day\" is that you\\'re allowed to be in the middle of any one buy/sell cycle.\\n        So if you bought your jth transaction on mth day, you should have sold your (j-1)th transaction on the \\n        mth day before buying the jth transaction. Now as a function this will have 3 components :-\\n            i) f(m, j-1) = Profit achieved by doing at most (j-1) transactions until day m.\\n            ii) -prices[m] = Because you bought on mth day, so your profit decreases by prices[m], i.e.\\n                the price of the stock on mth day. Thus -prices[m].\\n            iii) +prices[i] = Since you\\'re selling on ith day so you add prices[i] to your profit, i.e. the \\n                price of the stock on ith day.\\n        \\n        Combined it becomes f(m, j-1)-prices[m]+prices[i]. Now we assumed that we bought on mth day. This can\\n        actually be any day before ith day. Since we have to maximize our profit, so we take :-\\n        MAX(f(m, j-1)-prices[m]+prices[i]), for 0<m<i.\\n        \\n        Our formula then becomes :-\\n        f(i,j) = MAX(f(i-1, j), MAX(f(m, j-1)-prices[m]+prices[i])) where 0<m<i.\\n        \\n        This is applied using a usual DP solution. Time Complexity is O(n^2) is for the i,j traversal, and \\n        another linear search to find MAX(f(m, j-1)-prices[m]+prices[i]) where we traverse all\\n        values for m where 0<m<i;\\n        \\n        Thus TimeComplexity - O(n^3).

For cases where k<=n/2, Think DP. \\n        \\n        Let\\'s say f(i,j) is the profit with doing at most j transactions until day i.\\n        If you have to calculate f(i, j), thinking logically, there could be two possibilities :-\\n        1. You don\\'t sell/buy anything on this day, i.e. by day number i-1, you have already completed j \\n        transactions. You can quantify this by saying, \"The profit I got by doing at most j transactions by \\n        day number i-1\". As a function that means f(i-1, j).\\n        2. You sold the last share on the ith day, thereby completing j transactions on the ith day. However,\\n        that would mean that you would have bought that share sometime earlier. Let\\'s say you bought that on \\n        day number m. Then you can quantify this by saying, \"The profit I got by doing j-1 transctions until \\n        mth day, then buying a share on the mth day and selling it on the ith day\". The reason for \"j-1 \\n        transactions until the mth day\" is that you\\'re allowed to be in the middle of any one buy/sell cycle.\\n        So if you bought your jth transaction on mth day, you should have sold your (j-1)th transaction on the \\n        mth day before buying the jth transaction. Now as a function this will have 3 components :-\\n            i) f(m, j-1) = Profit achieved by doing at most (j-1) transactions until day m.\\n            ii) -prices[m] = Because you bought on mth day, so your profit decreases by prices[m], i.e.\\n                the price of the stock on mth day. Thus -prices[m].\\n            iii) +prices[i] = Since you\\'re selling on ith day so you add prices[i] to your profit, i.e. the \\n                price of the stock on ith day.\\n        \\n        Combined it becomes f(m, j-1)-prices[m]+prices[i]. Now we assumed that we bought on mth day. This can\\n        actually be any day before ith day. Since we have to maximize our profit, so we take :-\\n        MAX(f(m, j-1)-prices[m]+prices[i]), for 0<m<i.\\n        \\n        Our formula then becomes :-\\n        f(i,j) = MAX(f(i-1, j), MAX(f(m, j-1)-prices[m]+prices[i])) where 0<m<i.\\n        \\n        This is applied using a usual DP solution. Time Complexity is O(n^2) is for the i,j traversal, and \\n        another linear search to find MAX(f(m, j-1)-prices[m]+prices[i]) where we traverse all\\n        values for m where 0<m<i;\\n        \\n        Thus TimeComplexity - O(n^3).

                "content": "**Solution #1 - Recursion - Time Limit Exceeded**\\n1. Recursively find the max profit we can get in k transactions. The idea is to start at each index and if a price exists where we can make money by subtracting from our initial index AND we can still perform some transactions `k > 0`, then try it. \\n2. It is possible that during our recursive calls while calculating `v1` that we find a max that isn\\'t at the end, so we keep track of the max we have seen with Math.max() function.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {\\n        return rec(prices, 0, k);\\n    }\\n    public int rec(int[] prices, int idx, int k) {\\n        if(idx == prices.length) \\n            return 0;\\n        \\n        int v1 = 0;\\n        for(int i = idx+1; i < prices.length; i++) {\\n            if(prices[idx] < prices[i] && k > 0) \\n                v1 = Math.max(v1, rec(prices, i+1, k-1) + prices[i]-prices[idx]);\\n        }\\n        int v2 = rec(prices, idx+1, k);\\n        \\n        return Math.max(v1, v2);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Solution #2 - Recursion with Memoization - Accepted**\\n1. Same idea as before but we can store saved results into our dp table for fast lookups. \\n2. The two factors that are changing throughout our process our the current index we are on (**idx**) and **k**, so those are the two values we are going to keep track of when storing and looking up values.\\n3. We add a quicksolve for larger sets where our memory limit would get time limit exceeded and the solution is accepted.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {\\n        int n = prices.length;\\n        if(k >= n/2) return quick(prices);\\n        \\n        return rec(prices, 0, k, new Integer[k+1][n]);\\n    }\\n    public int rec(int[] prices, int idx, int k, Integer[][] dp) {\\n        if(idx == prices.length) \\n            return 0;\\n        if(dp[k][idx] != null)\\n            return dp[k][idx];\\n        \\n        int v1 = 0;\\n        for(int i = idx+1; i < prices.length; i++) {\\n            if(prices[idx] < prices[i] && k > 0) \\n                v1 = Math.max(v1, rec(prices, i+1, k-1, dp) + prices[i]-prices[idx]);\\n        }\\n        int v2 = rec(prices, idx+1, k, dp);\\n        \\n        return dp[k][idx] = Math.max(v1, v2);\\n    }\\n    public int quick(int[] prices) {\\n        int res = 0;\\n        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++)\\n            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1]) res += prices[i]-prices[i-1];\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Solution #3 - Bottom-Up Dynammic Programming - Accepted**\\n1. The idea is similar to our other solutions but here instead of using recursion to check all the possible prices we can iteratively build up our dp table which will lead us to the correct final answer.\\n2. I think this pretty much explains itself but the biggest and most confusing aspect of this specific algorithm is `max = Math.max(max, prev[j-1]-prices[j-1]);`. What is going on here is we are optimizing our buy for each price, given what we computed for previous `k` values. \\n3. Once we have our max, we can check it based on our previously computed max, or value at `dp[i][j]` to see if we can need to carry over the old max, or create a new one. `dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j-1], max + prices[j]);` is saying if sell at prices[j] is this a new max profit?\\n\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {\\n        int n = prices.length;\\n        if(k >= n/2) return quick(prices);\\n        \\n        int[][] dp = new int[k+1][n];\\n        \\n        for(int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\\n            int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\\n            for(int j = 1; j < n; j++) {\\n                max = Math.max(max, dp[i-1][j-1]-prices[j-1]);    // max so far if we buy at this price\\n                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j-1], max + prices[j]); // max if we sell at prices[j]\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return dp[k][n-1];\\n    }\\n    public int quick(int[] prices) {\\n        int res = 0;\\n        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++)\\n            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1]) res += prices[i]-prices[i-1];\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Solution #4 - Bottom-Up Dynammic Programming, Space Optimized - Accepted**\\n1. We saw in our last solution that at most, we are only looking back 1, step. When this is the case in dynammic programming problems we can always using two arrays to look what was previously used to calculate our new max profit. You can name them whatever you like, but for me, I like to use `prev` and `curr` because it helps me keep track of where I am, and which array I need to look at.\\n2. This is pretty much identical to our 2d dp solution but we swap the prev and curr array at each iteration accordingly.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {\\n        int n = prices.length;\\n        if(k >= n/2) return quick(prices);\\n        \\n        int[] prev = new int[n];\\n        \\n        for(int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\\n            int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\\n            int[] curr = new int[n];\\n            for(int j = 1; j < n; j++) {\\n                max = Math.max(max, prev[j-1]-prices[j-1]);    // max so far if we buy at this price\\n                curr[j] = Math.max(curr[j-1], max + prices[j]); // max if we sell at prices[j]\\n            }\\n            prev = curr;\\n        }\\n        return prev[n-1];\\n    }\\n    public int quick(int[] prices) {\\n        int res = 0;\\n        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++)\\n            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1]) res += prices[i]-prices[i-1];\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nA lot of times with these dynammic programming solutions I only see writeups on the optimized dp code and I always like to see how you build them out from a brute force recursive example, to an optimized one. Especially in interviews they are going to want to know the recurrence relationship and how you got to an optimized version so have an idea of how you came to the final solution is important.\\n\\nIf this helped you please upvote and leave a comment.",

                "content": "A lot discussions for this question are still super hard to understand, and one reason is that people swapped the i and j index, which commonly i should stand for the array index. Hope my explanation should be more clear and easier. \\n\\ndp[i,j]: i stands for the array index, i.e. the date, and the j stands for the the up to j transactions. One question at the very first thought, how can we deal with the notion of **at most**? Very easy, just refer to how we deal with the longest subsequence etc., that is, to let table[i] = table[i-1] as the initial value before the optimial induction. \\n\\nBased on the observation above, we can have the following induction. \\n- at the date i and up to j transactions, we can just not transact the jth transaction, so we have the dp[i,j] = dp[i, j-1] as the initial value \\n- what if we need to transact this jth transaction? As per the nature of DP\\'s top-down characteristics, the thing can happen on the ith day can only be a sell. As we should not have any transactions overlapped, there must be a date p before i that we buy, and between p+1 and i-1 there should not be any transaction any more. Therefore, the dp[i,j] is equal to, the price[i] that we sell, minors the price[p] that we buy, and the profit we already obtained on the p-1 day with at most j-1 times transaction. \\n- In order to reduce the time complexity, we dont have to loop repeatedly. Instead, we can use a greedy idea here, that we record the min value of (price[p]- dp[p-1, j-1]), because this min value can guarantee the profit on  dp[p-1, j-1] for sure is max \\n\\n```\\n  public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {\\n    int len = prices.length;\\n    if (k >= len / 2)\\n      return greedy(prices);\\n\\n    int[][] dp = new int[len][k+1];\\n    for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {\\n      int prevMinProfit = prices[0];\\n      for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {\\n        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], prices[i] - prevMinProfit);\\n        prevMinProfit = Math.min(prevMinProfit, prices[i] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]);\\n      }\\n    }\\n    return dp[len-1][k];\\n  }\\n\\n\\n  private int greedy(int[] prices) {\\n    int len = prices.length, profit = 0;\\n    for (int i = 1; i < len; i++){\\n      if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1])\\n        profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];\\n    }\\n    return profit;\\n  }\\n\\n```",

These vectors will be used to store the maximum profit for different scenarios. curr[op] represents the maximum profit at the current day with op indicating the number of operations (buy and sell transactions) performed so far.\\n\\nThe outer loop runs from n-1 to 0, iterating backward through the prices array. This helps us build the curr and next vectors from the last day to the first day.\\n\\nWithin the outer loop, there is a nested loop that runs from 0 to 2*k-1. This loop handles all possible scenarios for the number of operations performed at each day (both buying and selling).\\n\\nFor each index (current day) and op (number of operations), calculate the maximum profit for the current day and operation scenario:\\n\\nIf op is even, it means a buying operation is allowed, so we consider two options:\\na. Perform the buying operation on the current day and move to the next operation (op+1), considering the profit obtained by subtracting the stock price from the result of the next day\\'s calculation with the same number of allowed transactions (next[op+1]).\\nb. Skip the buying operation and move to the next operation (op), considering the profit obtained from the next day\\'s calculation with the same number of allowed transactions (next[op]).\\nIf op is odd, it means a selling operation is allowed, so we consider two options:\\na.

Perform the buying operation on the current day and move to the next day with the next operation (op+1), considering the profit obtained by subtracting the stock price from the result of the next day\\'s calculation with the same number of allowed transactions.\\nb. Skip the buying operation and move to the next day with the same operation (op), considering the profit obtained from the next day\\'s calculation with the same number of allowed transactions.\\nIf op is odd, it means a selling operation is allowed, so we consider two options:\\na. Perform the selling operation on the current day and move to the next day with the next operation (op+1), considering the profit obtained by adding the stock price to the result of the next day\\'s calculation with the same number of allowed transactions.\\nb. Skip the selling operation and move to the next day with the same operation (op), considering the profit obtained from the next day\\'s calculation with the same number of allowed transactions.\\nUpdate the dp table with the calculated maximum profit for the current index and op.\\n\\nReturn the calculated maximum profit for the current index and op.\\n\\nIn the maxProfit function, we initialize the memoization table dp of size n+1 (where n is the size of the prices vector) and 2 * k + 1 (to account for 2 * k possible operations, both buying and selling).\\n\\nCall the solve function with the starting parameters: prices, k, index=0, op=0, and the dp table.\\n\\nReturn the result obtained from the solve function as the maximum profit that can be obtained with at most k transactions on the given array of stock prices.\\n\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:0(N*K)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:0(N*K)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n\\nint solve(vector<int>& prices,int k ,int index,int op,vector<vector<int>>&dp)\\n{\\n    if(index>=prices.size())\\n    return 0;\\n\\n    if(op==k*2)\\n    return 0;\\n    \\n    int profit=0;\\n    \\n    if(dp[index][op]!=-1)\\n    return dp[index][op];\\n    \\n    if(op%2==0)\\n    // BUY ALLOWED\\n    {\\n        profit = max(-prices[index] + solve(prices, k, index + 1,op+1,dp ), 0 + solve(prices, k, index + 1, op,dp));\\n    }\\n    else\\n    {\\n        profit = max(prices[index] + solve(prices, k, index + 1,op+1,dp ), 0 + solve(prices, k, index + 1, op,dp));\\n\\n    }\\n    return dp[index][op]=profit;\\n}\\n\\n    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {\\n        int n= prices.size();\\n\\n        vector<vector<int>>dp(n+1,vector<int>(2*k,-1));\\n        return solve(prices,k,0,0,dp);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n# BOTTOM UP APPROACH\\n# Approach\\nThe function solvetab takes the prices vector and an integer k as input, representing the maximum number of allowed transactions.\\n\\nInitialize two 2D vectors curr and next, each with dimensions [2][k+1]. These vectors will be used to store the maximum profit for different scenarios. curr[buy][limit] represents the maximum profit at the current day with buy indicating whether the stock is bought (0 for not bought, 1 for bought), and limit representing the remaining transactions allowed (ranging from 0 to k).\\n\\nThe outer loop runs from n-1 to 0, iterating backward through the prices array. This helps us build the curr and next vectors from the last day to the first day.\\n\\nWithin the outer loop, there are two nested loops for buy and limit, each ranging from 0 to 1 and 1 to k, respectively. These loops handle all possible scenarios for buying or not buying the stock on each day and the number of remaining transactions.\\n\\nFor each combination of index, buy, and limit, calculate the maximum profit:\\n\\nIf buy is 1 (meaning the stock is bought on the current day), the profit is the maximum of two possibilities:\\na. The profit obtained by buying the stock on the current day and adding the profit from the next day with the same number of remaining transactions: -prices[index] + next[0][limit].\\nb. The profit obtained by not buying the stock on the current day and adding the profit from the next day with the same number of remaining transactions: 0 + next[1][limit].\\nIf buy is 0 (meaning the stock is not bought on the current day), the profit is the maximum of two possibilities:\\na. The profit obtained by not buying the stock on the current day and adding the profit from the next day with limit+1 transactions remaining: prices[index] + next[1][limit - 1].\\nb. The profit obtained by not buying the stock on the current day and adding the profit from the next day with the same number of remaining transactions: 0 + next[0][limit].\\nUpdate the curr[buy][limit] value with the calculated maximum profit.\\n\\nAfter filling the curr vector for the current day, copy its values to the next vector. This is done to update the values for the next day in the next iteration.\\n\\nOnce the loops are completed, the answer will be stored in next[1][k], where 1 indicates the stock is bought, and k represents the remaining transactions allowed.\\n\\nReturn next[1][k] as the maximum profit achievable with at most k transactions on the given array of stock prices.\\n\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:0(N*K)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:0(k)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n\\nint solvetab(vector<int>& prices,int k )\\n{\\n    int n = prices.size();\\n    vector<vector<int>>curr(2,vector<int>(k+1,0));\\n    vector<vector<int>>next(2,vector<int>(k+1,0));\\n\\n\\n    for(int index=n-1;index>=0;index--)\\n    {\\n        for(int buy=0;buy<=1;buy++)\\n        {\\n            for(int limit=1;limit<=k;limit++)\\n            {\\n                int profit=0;\\n            if(buy==1)\\n            {\\n                profit=max(-prices[index]+next[0][limit] , 0 + next[1][limit]); \\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                profit=max(prices[index]+ next[1][limit-1], 0 + next[0][limit]); \\n            }\\n            curr[buy][limit]=profit;\\n            }\\n            next=curr;\\n        }\\n\\n    }\\n    return next[1][k];\\n}\\n\\n    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {\\n        return solvetab(prices,k);\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

If we buy current stock we will change buy variable to 1 else it remains 0. We will take max of both the choices.\\n\\nNow if we have bought any stock before, we have to sell it before buying new stock. Here also we have to choices i,e either sell now or sell later and this is done by { ***else profit = max(prices[ind] + solve(ind+1,prices,0,k-1,N),solve(ind+1,prices,1,k,N));*** }.

                "content": "For this problem I went back to [the logic of his little brother problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/discuss/794836/), which I invite you to check and read in order to get a closer step-by-step idea with a simpler scenario, and worked to make it more general.\\n\\nTo do so, I had first of all to grab `nums` size and store it in `len`; then we get rid of edge cases, when `k == 0` or `len < 2`: in these occurrences, we just return `0`.\\n\\n`k` needs then to be \"fixed\": despite being told that it represents the number of \"transactions\" (ie: buy or sell operations), it is actually more like the number of profit-bearinng trades (ie: selling, after having bought for less); furthermore, it is pointless to consider a `k` which is wildly bigger than the number of days we are going to trade - and this in turn needs to be reduced to an even number to make sense (we would otherwise end up just buying for the last transaction, but it would be rather pointless).\\n\\nHence the expression: `min(k * 2, len - len % 2)`.\\n\\nWe do all this because we are going to create an array `dp` of values to help us, initialising all the odd cells to `0` and all the even ones to `INT_MAX`.\\n\\nThen it is time to loop through our list of prices for good, storing them as `currPrice`.\\n\\nAnd for each one, we apply the generalised version of [the logic I mentionend above](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/discuss/794836/):\\n* the very first cell of `dp` is going to be set as the minimum between its current value and `currPrice` - `min(dp[0], currPrice)`;\\n* each following odd indexed cell is going to be the maximum between its current value and `currPrice` minus the prevous one - `max(dp[i], currPrice - dp[i - 1])`;\\n* each following even indexed cell is going to be the minimum between its current value and `currPrice` minus the prevous one - `min(dp[i], currPrice - dp[i - 1])`;\\n\\nAfter we are done, we can just return the value of the last cell :)\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {\\n        int len = prices.size();\\n        // edge cases away\\n        if (!k || len < 2) return 0;\\n        // fixing k to be a meaningful, even number\\n        k = min(k * 2, len - len % 2);\\n        // declaring and setting up dp\\n        int dp[k];\\n        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) dp[i] = i % 2 ? 0 : INT_MAX;\\n        for (int currPrice: prices) {\\n            // setting up the first dp element\\n            dp[0] = min(dp[0], currPrice);\\n            // updating dp with all the subsequent trades\\n            for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {\\n                dp[i] = i % 2 ? max(dp[i], currPrice - dp[i - 1]) : min(dp[i], currPrice - dp[i - 1]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return dp[k - 1];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAnd with a small change to handle edge cases, I moved down from an average 648ms time to a wooping 8ms, still with the same memory usage (not sure how one could get less, then); full explanation of the logic [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/discuss/788360/) - the improved code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {\\n        int len = prices.size();\\n        // edge cases away\\n        if (!k || len < 2) return 0;\\n        // special case of unlimited transactions\\n        if (len < k * 2) {\\n            int sum = 0;\\n            for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) sum += max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);\\n            return sum;\\n        }\\n        // fixing k to be a meaningful, even number\\n        k = k * 2;\\n        // declaring and setting up dp\\n        int dp[k];\\n        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) dp[i] = i % 2 ? 0 : INT_MAX;\\n        for (int currPrice: prices) {\\n            // setting up the first dp element\\n            dp[0] = min(dp[0], currPrice);\\n            // updating dp with all the subsequent trades\\n            for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {\\n                dp[i] = i % 2 ? max(dp[i], currPrice - dp[i - 1]) : min(dp[i], currPrice - dp[i - 1]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return dp[k - 1];\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

If `k > n/2` the problem becomes much simpler and is `O(n)`.\\n\\nNow, we need to loop over `n` prices.  Inside each loop, we loop over `k` entries.  Hence, overall the problem is `O(n * k)`.\\n\\nHowever, we\\'ve seen that if `k > n/2`, then the problem becomes `O(n)`.  So we may assume `k <= n / 2`.

                "content": "#### Idea\\nThis problem has a boundary case: 2 * k >= n, which means you could make transactions as often as you want. So, it becomes a greedy problem, just summarizing every sub-profits. Time: O(n) | Space: O(1).\\n\\n    public int unlimitedTrans(int[] prices) {\\n            int maxProfit = 0;\\n            for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {\\n                maxProfit += Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);\\n            }\\n            return maxProfit;\\n        }\\n\\n---\\n\\nNow suppose 2 * k < n. This problem is a DP problem, solving current problem using previous optimum solution. Iterate t from 1 to k and iterate through prices , recording for each index i the best solution for prices[0, i] with t transactions. We store these solutions using two 2D auxiliary array, buy and sell.\\n\\n`buy[t][i]`: the most money you can have after you completing t-1 transactions and buying at day i.\\n\\n`sell[t][i]`: the max profit you can have when you sell at day i (currently at t th transaction).\\n\\nWe could summarize the formula:\\n\\n`buy[t][i] = max(sell[t-1][1..(i-1)]) - prices[i]` Note: you buy at day i, you must complete t-1 transactions.\\n\\n`sell[t][i] = max(buy[t][1..(i-1)]) + prices[i]` Note: when you sell at day i, currently you are at transaction t.\\n\\nTime: `O(kn)` | Space: `O(kn)`\\n\\nTake a look at the formula again, we could find that we don\\u2019t need to store all optimum solution from 1 to k. So we could further reduce the space complexity buy using two 1-D array (buy[i], sell[i]). Space: `O(n)`.\\n\\nThe initialization of buy[i] and sell[i], which is the state of 0th transaction, is all 0. Inside the double for-loop, we just update the array and keep track of previous max value, which takes constant time. We first update buy because it uses the previous state of sell. Then we update sell. \\n#### Code\\n```\\npublic int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {\\n        if(prices.length <= 1 || k == 0) return 0;\\n        if(2*k >= prices.length) return unlimitedTrans(prices);\\n        int[] buy = new int[prices.length];\\n        int[] sell = new int[prices.length];\\n        int maxProfit = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\\n        \\n        for(int t = 1; t < k + 1; t++) {\\n            // Update buy\\n            int maxPreSell = sell[0];\\n            for(int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {\\n                buy[i] = i == 0 ? prices[i] * (-1) : maxPreSell - prices[i];\\n                maxPreSell = Math.max(maxPreSell, sell[i]);\\n            }\\n            // Update sell\\n            int maxCurrBuy = buy[0];\\n            for(int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {\\n                sell[i] = i == 0 ? 0 : maxCurrBuy + prices[i];\\n                maxCurrBuy = Math.max(maxCurrBuy, buy[i]);\\n                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, sell[i]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return maxProfit;\\n    }\\n```",

                "content": "I didn\\'t come up with the solution until I see the brilliant community\\'s fantastic answers. But what bothers me is - what\\'s the thinking process? Why do I need the global and local dp arrays? Below are my thinking process:\\n\\n1. there are only two conditions in a certain day: **you sell stocks at that day, or you don\\'t sell stocks at that day.** The best result would be the larger of the two.\\n2. For a given day, we can define an array global[k][i], indicating that the maximum profit till day i, and it has completed k transactions (not necessisarily conducted on day i). So global[k][i] would have some relationship with global[k][i-1] or global[k-1][i-1]. Ideally, global[k][i] should be the max of:\\na. the profit you can make when: in the previous i-1 days, you have completed all the k transactions (i.e. no transction on ith day)\\nb. the profit you can make when: in the previous i-1 days, you have completed k-1 trasactions, and in the ith day, you have completed the kth transaction (i.e. have transaction on ith day)\\na) is obviously global[k][i-1], however b) is not relevant to global array. So we would define another array local[k][i], indicating that the max profit that we can make when we completed k transactions in the first i days (and the last transaction is performed on ith day)\\n**Ah - so we actually need another array (aka local)**\\n\\n3. We now need to know how do we construct global and local array. For global array, it\\'s relatively easier. It would be:\\nglobal[k][i] = max(global[k][i-1], local[k][i]), corresponding to above (whether there\\'s transaction on day i)\\n\\n\\n4. How do we calculate local[k][i] then? Since we will conduct a transaction on day i (per definition), there would be two cases:\\nc. in the previous i-1 days, k-1 transactions have been completed (i.e. global[k-1][i-1]; the kth transaction would be performed on day i. There are two sub-cases here: if we define diff=price[i]-price[i-1], if diff > 0, we know we can make money in the last transaction; otherwise if diff <=0, we won\\'t be able to make money by buying at day i-1 and selling at day i, so we will just do buy and sell at day i, i.e. making 0 dollar. Overall, the max profit we can make for condition c) is: global[k-1][i-1]+max(diff, 0)\\nd. in the previous i-1 days, k transactions have been completed and the kth transaction is happening on day i-1 (i.e. local[k][i-1]. In this case, no matter what we have done on day i-1, we can always \"extend\" the last transaction to day i. For example, if you buy at price 2 and sell at price 3, and buy at price 3 (on the same day) and sell at price 4, which has 2 transactions, you can actually combine the two transactions and have just 1 transaction which is buy at price 2 and sell at price 4. Thru this, we know that we can always extend the last transaction from day i-1 to day i, and also add diff. So the max profit for d) is: local[k][i-1]+diff\\ne. Why don\\'t we consider a case where in the previous i-1 days, k transactions have been completed and kth transaction is NOT necessarily performed on day i-1 (following case d above)? This is already covered by global[k][i-1], which is one of the input for global[k][i].\\nSo for local[k][i] = max(global[k-1][i-1]+max(diff,0), local[k][i-1]+diff)\\n5. Lastly, pay attention to some implementation details:\\na. Note that the above approach uses O(kn) memory, but when k is very large and n is small, this can actually be reduced to the Stock II problem, where you can buy and sell stocks in unlimited time. This will help avoid some OOM issue\\nb. Also pay attention to the dp array. It should be (k+1)*n, since the k dimension would range from 0 to k which is k+1 numbers.\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maxProfit(self, k: int, price: List[int]) -> int:\\n        n = len(price)\\n        if n <= 1 or k == 0:\\n            return 0\\n        if k> n/2:\\n            max_profit = 0\\n            for i in range(1,n):\\n                diff = price[i] - price[i-1]\\n                if diff > 0:\\n                    max_profit += diff\\n            return max_profit\\n        \\n        local_dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(k+1)]\\n        global_dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(k+1)]\\n        for i in range(1,n):\\n            diff = price[i] - price[i-1]\\n            for kk in range(1,k+1):\\n                local_dp[kk][i] = max(global_dp[kk-1][i-1]+max(diff,0), local_dp[kk][i-1]+diff)\\n                global_dp[kk][i] = max(global_dp[kk][i-1], local_dp[kk][i])\\n        return global_dp[-1][-1]\\n```",

If the number of local maximum points is no larger than k, then we should operate at all the maxP points and the maximum margin we can make is sum(maxP-minP).

By adopting this approach, we aim to provide a simplified understanding of dynamic programming and demonstrate how memoization can be a valuable tool for solving complex optimization problems--->\\n\\n\\n# Understanding the problem\\n\\n\\nThe stock trading problems presented involve an array of stock prices, where each element represents the price of the stock on a given day. The objective is to determine the maximum profit that can be obtained by performing a series of buy and sell transactions, subject to certain constraints. These constraints may include *transaction fees*, *cooldown periods*, or a *maximum number of transactions allowed*.\\n\\n\\n# What are things we should take care of-\\n\\n- The value of stock on the day at which we are currently on.\\n- Total number of transactions\\n- Whether it is possible to buy stock ot not on that day (Explained below)\\n\\n# Variable and their Significance\\n\\n- Index---- we have to keep track of index as it can\\'t go beyond size of prices.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n- State/Buy---- First we need to understand we can not buy or sale at any day, means if we are holding any stock we must have to sell it before buying another one. the state is kind of flag representing whether we have liberty to buy stock or not.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n- K/Transactions----The variable k represents the maximum number of transactions allowed in the given problem. It determines the number of buy-sell pairs we can perform. The initial value of k depends on the problem statement and constraints. In some scenarios, it may be a fixed constant, while in others, it may vary based on the input or problem requirements. For example, if the problem allows at most k transactions, we initialize k to the given value. As transactions occur (both buying and selling), k is decremented by 1 to reflect the completion of a transaction pair.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Generalized Code\\n```\\nint dp[MAX_DAYS][MAX_STATES][MAX_TRANSACTIONS];\\n\\nint solve(int index,  int state, vector<int>& prices,int transactions) {\\n    // Base case: Check if we have reached the end or any other termination condition\\n    \\n    // Memoization: Check if the state has already been computed\\n    \\n    int profit = 0;\\n    \\n    // Make decisions based on the current state and constraints\\n    \\n    // Recursive calls: Explore all possible transitions\\n    \\n    // Update the memoization table with the computed profit\\n    \\n    return profit;\\n}\\n\\nint maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, /* additional parameters based on specific constraints */) {\\n    // Initialize the memoization table\\n    \\n    // Call the recursive function with appropriate initial parameters\\n    \\n    // Return the maximum profit\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# Understanding the Similarities\\nWhile each stock trading problem may appear unique, they can be broken down into common elements. Let\\'s identify the core components that are shared across these problems:\\n\\n- State Representation:\\n    In all stock trading problems, we need to define the state of our trading decisions. This state typically includes information such as the index of the current day, the number of transactions made, and whether we hold a stock or not.\\n\\n- Decision-Making:\\n    At each day, we have three options: buy, sell, or do nothing. The specific constraints of each problem determine the valid choices. For instance, in some problems, we cannot buy on the next day after selling, while in others, we may have a cooldown period or transaction fees.\\n\\n- Profit Calculation:\\n    The ultimate goal is to maximize the profit.

Understanding these similarities can help in deriving a more general recursive code that can handle slight variations in the constraints of the stock trading problems.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

If we hold the stock flag is 1 else it is 0. \\n\\nIf we do not hold a stack, we have two ways either buy the stock or just do not buy. We need to pick the maximum from both the cases. In the case considering that you buy the stock update the flag as 1 and subtract 1 from Transactions Left as one of the transaction is done for buying. As you buy the stoct your money is debited so we subtract the money.

That\\'s why I wrote this summary. If you find it useful, a like will be appreciated.\\n\\nI will introduce IV before III, as III is actually a special case. However, there exists a different solution for III as well.\\n\\nI,II\\nDefine a peak as a local maximum, a valley as a local minimum.\\n\\nThe essence of these first two problems is to find 1) largest difference between a peak and a valley in an array; 2) the sum of all peak-valley-differences that exist.(as there is no limit of the number of transactions, which makes things easier compared to problem[3,4]).\\n\\nfor (1), keeps track of minimum until current position and records maximum possible profit; for (2), add all positive gaps suffices. Remember, a valley-peak-valley-peak will make profit greater rather than a merged valley-peak though the absolute difference may be greater for the latter one. See the graph explanation on Leetcode solution.\\n\\nIV\\nProblem 4 actually generalises all cases in this scenario. However, as k becomes larger, the problem 4 degrades to problem 2. It is important to note that the dynamic programming solution works when k is less than the maximum possible number of transactions.\\n\\nDP Solution: split the problem hierarchically. Consider the case where we make i transactions, i = 1, 2, ... k.\\n\\nOn each day, there are two states: hold stocks(H) or not hold stocks(NH). Three possible options for the operator: buy, sell or None.\\n\\nDenote the number of days by j. The transition formula for dp here is:\\n\\nH[i][j] = max(NH[i-1][j-1]-prices[j],H[i][j-1]) NH[i][j] = max(H[i][j]+prices[j],NH[i][j-1])\\n\\nExplaination for the first formula: on each day j, either we 1)buy the stock, which begins a new transaction, thus the profit is NH[i-1][j-1] minus current stock price; either 2)None, and the profit keeps the same as on day j-1.\\n\\nFor implementation, note that updating H concerns previous NH and current H, while updating NH concerns both current NH and current NH. Thus, update firstly H, then NH, a one-dimensional dp array suffices.\\n\\nIII\\nProblem 3 can be solved using the solution for 4, but in the case of at most 2 transactions permitted, there exists a simpler solution. As we can find the two(if existed) maximum profit seperately, until day i and after day i.\\n\\nOn day i, we calculate two maximum, in forward and backward ways respectively. Record the sum of these two maximums for each day, and pick the largest one.\\n\\nI\\'ve uploaded my solutions for III and IV on my Github.

That\\'s why I wrote this summary. If you find it useful, a like will be appreciated.\\n\\nI will introduce IV before III, as III is actually a special case. However, there exists a different solution for III as well.\\n\\nI,II\\nDefine a peak as a local maximum, a valley as a local minimum.\\n\\nThe essence of these first two problems is to find 1) largest difference between a peak and a valley in an array; 2) the sum of all peak-valley-differences that exist.(as there is no limit of the number of transactions, which makes things easier compared to problem[3,4]).\\n\\nfor (1), keeps track of minimum until current position and records maximum possible profit; for (2), add all positive gaps suffices. Remember, a valley-peak-valley-peak will make profit greater rather than a merged valley-peak though the absolute difference may be greater for the latter one. See the graph explanation on Leetcode solution.\\n\\nIV\\nProblem 4 actually generalises all cases in this scenario. However, as k becomes larger, the problem 4 degrades to problem 2. It is important to note that the dynamic programming solution works when k is less than the maximum possible number of transactions.\\n\\nDP Solution: split the problem hierarchically. Consider the case where we make i transactions, i = 1, 2, ... k.\\n\\nOn each day, there are two states: hold stocks(H) or not hold stocks(NH). Three possible options for the operator: buy, sell or None.\\n\\nDenote the number of days by j. The transition formula for dp here is:\\n\\nH[i][j] = max(NH[i-1][j-1]-prices[j],H[i][j-1]) NH[i][j] = max(H[i][j]+prices[j],NH[i][j-1])\\n\\nExplaination for the first formula: on each day j, either we 1)buy the stock, which begins a new transaction, thus the profit is NH[i-1][j-1] minus current stock price; either 2)None, and the profit keeps the same as on day j-1.\\n\\nFor implementation, note that updating H concerns previous NH and current H, while updating NH concerns both current NH and current NH. Thus, update firstly H, then NH, a one-dimensional dp array suffices.\\n\\nIII\\nProblem 3 can be solved using the solution for 4, but in the case of at most 2 transactions permitted, there exists a simpler solution. As we can find the two(if existed) maximum profit seperately, until day i and after day i.\\n\\nOn day i, we calculate two maximum, in forward and backward ways respectively. Record the sum of these two maximums for each day, and pick the largest one.\\n\\nI\\'ve uploaded my solutions for III and IV on my Github.
