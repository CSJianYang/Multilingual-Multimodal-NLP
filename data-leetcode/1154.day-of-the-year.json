Use a `SELECT` statement to query the `Views` table.\\n2. Use the `DISTINCT` keyword to return only distinct values of `author_id`.\\n3. Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows where `author_id` is equal to `viewer_id`.\\n4. Use an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the result table by `author_id` in ascending order.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: The time complexity of this solution depends on the size of the `Views` table and the efficiency of the database management system.\\n- Space complexity: The space complexity of this solution is constant, as it only requires a fixed amount of memory to store the result table.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n# Write your MySQL query statement below\\nSELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id\\nFROM Views\\nWHERE author_id = viewer_id\\nORDER BY author_id ASC;\\n```",

To ensure that we get unique author_id, we use the DISTINCT keyword.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. In the SELECT statement, we select distinct author_id to obtain every author only once. To get the correct solution here, we need to name the author_id as \\'id\\' as given in the example output. \\n2. In the FROM statement, we write the table name \\'Views\\' from where we retrieve the columns.\\n3. In the WHERE clause, we define the condition which is that author_id is same as viewer_id.\\n4. Lastly, we need to arrange the output list \\'id\\' in ascending order and hence we use \\'ORDER BY\\' clause. The default order for \\'ORDER BY\\' is Ascending and hence there is no need to write ASC afterwards. If we need to arrange in a descending order, the query would become \\'ORDER BY id DESC\\'\\n\\n### Please upvote if you find my solution helpful.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n# Write your MySQL query statement below\\nSELECT DISTINCT(author_id) as id \\nFROM Views\\nWHERE author_id = viewer_id\\nORDER BY id; #ORDER BY id ASC\\n```\\n```\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\ndef article_views_i(views: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\\n    views = views[views[\\'author_id\\'] == views[\\'viewer_id\\']]\\n    views = views[[\\'author_id\\']].sort_values(by = \\'author_id\\')\\n    views.drop_duplicates(subset = \\'author_id\\', inplace = True)\\n    views.rename(columns = {\\'author_id\\':\\'id\\'}, inplace = True)\\n    return views\\n```\\n",

That will fuck up your brain because you are not as clever as others.  But if you treat the transforamtion as mappings you will find it much easier. It only allows, one-to-one mapping and many-to-one mappings(first two in image below).   So if you find that one character are mapping to two different char in str2, you can conclude a false immediately.\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/qjhdtc001/image_1588097571.png)\\n\\nSince there are only lower letters, the mappings range <= 26. But if mappings are full(==26), unless the str1 and str2 are identical, it is not good to transform.  You can prove that by contrdiction.  Hope that will help."

If not, we can\\'t have divisibility by `100` so we only check for `4`. If we do have divisibility by `100` we check the first two digits for divsibility by `4`, which implies and necessitates divisibility by `400`.\\n- Month between calculation seems a little scuffed because it was simplified quite a lot of times from an initial formula I calculated. This considers February to have 28 days.\\n   - The formula adds 30 for every month up to now\\n   - It then adds 1 for every other month for those that have 1 more day\\n   - The `-32` is `-30 -2` and cancels out the current month and February\\'s missing 2 days. Remember that current month\\'s progress is given by `day`.\\n   - The ` ((month - 1 >> 3) & month)` can only be `0` or `1` and adds one more day if the month is *odd* and later than August. This stems from the fact that August has 31 days despite following a 31 day month, July. Therefore the parity of 31 day months changes from odd to even.\\n\\n# Help me make this even faster and crush the array gang.\\n\\n# Code (Java 8ms <= 100%)\\n```Java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int dayOfYear(String date) {\\n\\n        int month = 10 * date.charAt(5) + date.charAt(6) - 528, day = 10 * date.charAt(8) + date.charAt(9) - 528;\\n        \\n        // fast return if we don\\'t need leap years\\n        if (month <= 2) return day + (1 - month >>> 27);\\n\\n        // months between\\n        day += 30 * month + month / 2 - 32 + ((month - 1 >> 3) & month);\\n\\n        // leap year\\n        int yearPart = 10 * date.charAt(2) + date.charAt(3) - 528;\\n        if (yearPart == 0) yearPart = 10 * date.charAt(0) + date.charAt(1) - 528;\\n\\n        return day + (((yearPart & 3) - 1) >>> 31);\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

It determines the day of the year by considering the days in each month leading up to the given date.\\n\\n# Approach\\n    Parse the input date: Extract the year, month, and day from the input date string. These values are represented as y, m, and d respectively.\\n\\n    Check for Leap Year: Determine whether the year y is a leap year or not. A leap year has 366 days (29 days in February) instead of the usual 365 days (28 days in February). Leap years occur either when the year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or when the year is divisible by 400.\\n\\n    Calculate the Day of the Year:\\n        Initialize a variable d to store the day of the year.\\n        Iterate through the months from 1 to m - 1 (since the given date is not included in the calculation).\\n        For each month, add the corresponding number of days to the d:\\n            If the month is January (1) or March (3) or May (5) or July (7) or August (8) or October (10), add 31 days.\\n            If the month is April (4) or June (6) or September (9) or November (11), add 30 days.\\n            If the month is February (2), add 29 days if it\\'s a leap year, otherwise add 28 days.\\n\\n    Return the Result: After the loop, the variable d will hold the day of the year corresponding to the given date. Return the value of d as the output.\\n\\nThe code doesn\\'t involve any complex data structures or nested loops. It simply involves basic arithmetic calculations, conditions, and a loop that iterates through a small range of values. The approach is efficient and straightforward for calculating the day of the year.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n$$O(1)$$\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n$$O(1)$$\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def dayOfYear(self, date: str) -> int:\\n        d, m, y = int(date[8:]), int(date[5:7]), int(date[:4])\\n        if (y % 4 == 0 and y % 100 != 0) or (y % 100 == 0 and y % 400 == 0):\\n            leap = True\\n        else:\\n            leap = False\\n        for n in range(1, m):\\n            match(n):\\n                case 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 8 | 10:\\n                    d += 31\\n                case 4 | 6 | 9 | 11:\\n                    d += 30\\n                case 2:\\n                    if leap:\\n                        d += 29\\n                    else:\\n                        d += 28\\n        return d\\n```",
