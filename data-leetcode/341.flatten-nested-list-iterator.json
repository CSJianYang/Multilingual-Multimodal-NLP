                "content": "\\u2014\\u2014Jump to the final code if you\\'re easly bored, down below!\\n\\nOk, you\\'re still here eh. Here are the train of thoughts to arrive to the final solution:\\n\\n* The answer is always between `1` to `length of nums + 1`. Why? Because the biggest positive integer we can put as answer for the input of length n, is when the input is `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`, in that case the answer is `n+1`. Otherwise, if the input is not exactly as mentioned (in any order), then the answer must be a positive integer that is less than `n+1`. \\n\\n* Given that the answer is limited to said range, then we can simply solve this with linear time and linear space. We can create a `flag` booleans that indicate whether an `index` is appearing in the `nums` or not. See simple code below!\\n```Python\\nflags = [False] * len(nums)\\n\\nfor num in nums:\\n\\tif num > 0:\\n\\t\\tflags[num-1] = True // notice that we -1, so that the answer set 1..n becomes 0-indexed 0..n-1\\n\\t\\t\\nfor index in range(len(flags)):\\n\\tif flags[index] == False:\\n\\t\\treturn index + 1\\n\\t\\t\\nreturn len(nums) + 1 // happens when all flags are true\\n```\\n\\n* Now, how do we improve this to be a better solution with constant additional space? In other words, how to get rid of the additional booleans? You can probably guess it already. Yes by using the original `nums` array as flags. \\n\\n* Let say we flag it by changing the value in `index` to `None` if it\\'s appearing in `nums`. Problem? Yes, we still need to retain the original values in `nums`, because as we loop over the `nums` to flag the `index`, we will definitely get in trouble if the `index` we\\'re flagging hasn\\'t been evaluated yet. Take an example of `[3,1,2]` (which supposed to have the answer `4`), here is how the `nums` array is being evaluated, in each loop-step:\\n** Before loop: `[3,1,2]`\\n** Loop at index 0: `[3, 1, None]`. The `index` that `3` points to is index `2`, therefore the value becomes `None`.  This is the part where we change index `2`, while index `2` itself hasn\\'t been evaluated yet.\\n** Loop at index 1: `[None, 1, None]`. The `index` that `1` points to is index `0`, therefore the value becomes `None`.\\n** Loop at index 2: `[None, 1, None]`. At this step, it\\'s doing nothing because the original value of `2` has already been changed to `None`, and we have no way to flag index `1` as `None`.\\n\\n*  So how do we flag elements in `nums` while also retaining original `value` **that matters**? Notice I mentioned \\'that matters\\', because we only care about positive integers. We can simply discard anything that is not positive integers. And because of that, we can use positive and negative value as flag\\u2014multiply the value with `-1` to flag it so it becomes negative. So positive means hasn\\'t been flagged, negative means has been flagged. Whether it\\'s positive or negative, we can get the original value with `abs`. So for above example, the correct steps would be:\\n** Before loop: `[3, 1, 2]`\\n** Loop at index 0: `[3, 1, -2]`\\n** Loop at index 1: `[-3, 1, -2]`\\n** Loop at index 2: `[-3, -1, -2]`\\nAnd finally when we\\'re looking for the answer, we find that all the values are negative (flagged), therefore the answer is `4`.\\n\\n* Final thoughts: what about those zeros and negative nums??? Simply change them to 0 before entering the main algorithm explained above. We just need to be careful not to multiply those zeros to `-1` when flagging, instead change it to something like `-inf` (as long as it\\'s a negative value, then it\\'s flagged) \\n\\nHere is the final full code:\\n```python\\ndef firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n\\tfor i,num in enumerate(nums):\\n\\t\\tif num <= 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tnums[i] = 0\\n\\n\\tfor i,num in enumerate(nums):\\n\\t\\tindex = abs(num)-1\\n\\t\\tif index >= 0 and index < len(nums):\\n\\t\\t\\tif nums[index] == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnums[index] = -inf\\n\\t\\t\\telif nums[index] > 0: // we dont want to make negative to be positive again, when its duplicated num\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnums[index] *= -1\\n\\n\\tfor index,num in enumerate(nums):\\n\\t\\tif num >= 0:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn index + 1\\n\\n\\treturn len(nums) + 1\\n```\\n\\nTime Complexity: O(N)\\nSpace Complexity: O(1)\\n\\nPlease upvote if you find this useful, comment if you find any improvement points!\\n\\n",

In this way, the first element in the array which is not present in its correct position (index), will be the answer.\\nWhat I mean by correct position is that, in cycle sort, in this question, if we follow the above approach, then index 0 will have element whose value is 1, index 1 will have 2, index 2 will have 3 and so on, and the first element to break this rule, that index, plus 1 will be our answer, because at that index the correct element which was to exist there was an element whose value is index + 1, but if there is some incorrect element present, then index + 1 element is the first missing positive and hence it is the answer.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(N)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int firstMissingPositive(int[] nums) {\\n    \\n        //the first two conditions in the if statement take care \\n        //that negatives and elements greater than the size of \\n        //the array are ignored, while applying cycle sort, and \\n        //rest is the similar code of cycle sort\\n\\n        int i = 0;\\n        while(i < nums.length) {\\n            int correct = nums[i] - 1;\\n            if(nums[i] <= nums.length && nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] != nums[correct]) {\\n\\n                int temp = nums[i];\\n                nums[i] = nums[correct];\\n                nums[correct] = temp;\\n            }\\n            else {\\n                i++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        int count = 0;\\n\\n    //after cycle sort has been applied, we will find the first element\\n    //which is not at the correct index, and return that index + 1\\n\\n        for(int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {\\n\\n            if(nums[j] != j + 1) {\\n                return j + 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n    //if every element is at its correct index, then obviously the first\\n    //missing positive integer is nums.length + 1\\n\\n        return nums.length + 1;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n![cat.jpeg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/534c581c-ce0e-4b09-8c2e-40e316fe3417_1689353156.4622288.jpeg)\\n",

                "content": "<b>The problem</b>\\nHonestly, it was surpising to me to find out that this problem is marked as hard.\\nWhen I saw the problem, I thought it was probably easy or medium difficulty.\\nI had done some similar problems previously, that required me to use the original array and negate numbers at indices according to some other values.\\nI guess it can appear hard to solve it in linear time, if you miss the clue.\\n\\n<b>Approach</b>\\nThe main thing here is to really understand the question. They are looking for the first positive integer, of <b>ALL</b> positive integers, that does not exist in the given array.\\nThis implies that the first missing number can be in range from ```1``` to ```N``` (size of the input).\\nNow we only have to figure out which one is the first in the sequence that is not present in the array.\\n\\n<b>Solution 1</b>\\nCreate a new array of input size, with all values set to ```-1```.\\nFor each value in the original array, set ```newArray[value - 1]``` to ```1```, if the value is within the ```1``` - ```N``` range.\\nNow we go through the new array and look for the first ```-1``` value. The missing number is ```index + 1```, since we are looking only for positive numbers and we start count from 1, while index is zero based.\\n```\\nclass Solution { // Time and Space: O(N)\\npublic:\\n\\tint firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\t\\tint size = nums.size();\\n\\t\\tvector<int> sequence(size, -1); // Init array with same size to all -1s\\n\\t\\tfor (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\\n\\t\\t\\tif (nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] <= size)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsequence[nums[i] - 1] = 1; // Set numbers at indices to positive\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { // First that has value -1 is the missing one\\n\\t\\t\\tif (sequence[i] == -1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn i + 1;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\n\\t\\treturn size + 1;\\n\\t}\\n};\\n```\\n\\n<b>Solution 2</b>\\nVery similar to first solution, but we use the original array instead of creating a new one. So the space complexity is constant.\\nSince we don\\'t need to look at the negative values in the array, we set them to ```0```. Then we use the original array to negate all the numbers at indices for which the value exists in the array.\\nIt is a little tricky, and my solution might require some polishing, but overall, it isn\\'t difficult.\\n```\\nclass Solution { // Time: O(N), Space: O(1)\\npublic:\\n\\tint firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\t\\tint size = nums.size();\\n\\t\\tbool hasOne = false;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (int& n : nums) { // Set all negatives to 0\\n\\t\\t\\tif (n < 0)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tn = 0;\\n\\t\\t\\telse if (n == 1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thasOne = true;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\n\\t\\tif (!hasOne) // One is the first missing\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 1;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { // Negate all numbers at indices by found values\\n            int currNum = abs(nums[i]);\\n\\t\\t\\tif (currNum > 0 && currNum <= size)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif (nums[currNum - 1] == 0)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnums[currNum - 1] = -1;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse if (nums[currNum - 1] > 0)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnums[currNum - 1] *= -1; // Negate it\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (int i = 0; i < size; i++) // Find first non negative number\\n\\t\\t\\tif (nums[i] > -1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn i + 1;\\n\\n\\t\\treturn size + 1;\\n\\t}\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAny suggestions or advice on how to improve the solutions are always welcome.

If we find `3`, then swap it with a value on index `2`.\\n\\nAfter we swap the value, we need to examine the swapped new value again, so we should not move to the next position.

                "content": "Let us understand the whole problem in three steps of progression, with an example nums array, say : 3, -1, 4, 2, 1, 7\\n\\nOne observation that we can make is: *we can always ignore the negative values and 0\\'s present in the array* as they contribute to nothing. We have to find the first missing positive number.\\n\\n**Naive approach:  (extra space)**\\n\\n1. In one pass, we find the largest positive number present in array. (If no positive no., return 1).\\n2. We create an array till the size of the largest positive number present + 1 (+ 1 if following 1 based indexing). We put 0 in every index initially.\\n3. In second pass, we take each positive no. from the array and mark that corresponding index in our array with 1. (we ignore negative numbers and 0)\\n4. We iterate our array and the first index which has not been visited / marked true, is our first missing positive number.\\n\\nDry run:\\nnums array -----> 3               -1               4                  2                1                7\\n\\nfor 3, we mark index 3 of array as true/1. We ignore -1. And continue like this:\\n```\\nnums array -------------> 3 -1  4  2  1  7\\ncount array indices ----> 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      0  1  1  1  1  0  0  1\\n```\\n\\nNow when we iterate on this array from index 1 to 7 (following 1 based indexing), we see 5 is the first empty index. So we return 5.\\n\\n**Reducing auxiliary array size:**\\n\\nOne problem with this approach is if there are huge gaps between numbers, say 1, 2, 3, 22471. We will unnecessarily create a huge array. We can avoid that by making the following observation:\\n`first missing positive number has to lie within {1,n+1} , where n-> nums.size()`\\nSo we can create array only of size n + 1.\\n\\nDry run:\\nnums array -----> 3               -1               4                  2                1                7\\n\\nfor 3, we mark index 3 of array as true/1.

If all indices have nums[i] == i, then we return n + 1.\\n\\nDry run: (using 0 based indexing)\\nnums array -----> 3               -1               4                  2                1                7\\n\\nfor 3, we put 3 in index 2.

Think of an input where the answer can be more than n + 1. You won\\'t be able to find it.**\\n\\nFirst way is to create an extra boolean array called `exists`. After filling this array, `exists[i]` should be able to indicate if a number `i+1` is the required answer or not. That is `if exists[i] is false` then this means that `i+1` is the answer.\\n\\n# <ins>First Approach - Extra Space:\\n\\n```java\\n    // TC: O(n), SC: O(n)\\n    public int firstMissingPositive_ExtraArray(int[] nums) {\\n        int n = nums.length;\\n        boolean[] exists = new boolean[n];\\n        for (int num : nums) {\\n            if (num > 0 && num <= n) exists[num - 1] = true;\\n        }\\n        for (int i = 0; i < exists.length; i++) {\\n            if (!exists[i]) return i + 1;\\n        }\\n        return n + 1;\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n<br>\\n<hr>\\n<br>\\n\\n# <ins>Second Approach - No Space:\\nSame as first approach, but instead of having an extra boolean array, think of using the giving input array itself. \\n\\n**Key Insight in second approach: Remember that we don\\'t care about negative values in the array. Let\\'s throw them into dustbin \\uD83D\\uDE02**\\n\\nSo we override the negatives, and then we manually flip the sign of the numbers to indicate if a value exists or not. Read the comments in the solution below.\\n\\n```java\\n    public int firstMissingPositive_NoSpace(int[] nums) {\\n        int n = nums.length;\\n        // pre-process array so that non-positive ints are overwritten with n + 1;\\n        // why n + 1? coz this is the safest value to choose during\\n        // floyd cycle way which we are about to do in second for loop below\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            if (nums[i] <= 0) nums[i] = n + 1;\\n        }\\n\\n        // Take abs of A[i] and then make sure its within bounds and use that as index.\\n        // This is also called as Floyd Cycle algorithm or something.

                "content": "Swap Sort Playlist by Aditya Verma - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWdJfdZHiNYYM46tYQUjbBJx\\n\\nThis problem is a variation of 1 to n missing number problems.\\n\\nHere, Range of numbers is from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1\\n\\nBut as the problem statement says, we need to return the first Missing \"Positive\" number which means we care about only the positive numbers.\\n\\nThe smallest missing positive number = the first missing number.\\n\\nSo, what we can do is we manually pick the range 1 to n where n is the length of given array and then place each element at its correct place.\\n\\n\\t\\tnums = [3,4,-1,1]\\n\\nSo here, n = 4 which means ideally, all numbers from 1 to 4 should be in this array. Lets apply swap sort on this array. We only care about numbers from range 1 to n because that\\'s how swap sort works.\\n\\nDo note that ideally, at index i, element should be i + 1. That\\'s what we are going to check.\\n\\n    at index = 0, we have 3. is 3 > 0 and <= n? YES. SO it can be considered. \\n\\n    It 3 at its correct place? NO. Its correct place is index 2. \\n\\n    So to place 3 at its correct place, swap element at index 2 with 3. \\n\\n    [-1,4,3,1]\\n\\n    Now at index = 0, we have a negative number so we ignore it and move ahead.\\n\\n    At index = 1, we have 4. It should be at index = 3. SO swap\\n\\n    [-1,1,3,4]\\n\\n    Again at index = 1, we have 1. But 1 should be at index = 0. So Swap.\\n\\n    [1,-1,3,4]\\n\\n    And since now we have a negative number at index = 1, ignore it.\\n\\n    At index = 2, we already have correct number i.e, 3\\n\\n    AT index = 3 we already have correct number i.e., 4\\n\\n\\nSo finally, our array becomes [1,-1,3,4]\\n\\nAnd now, we do the second part of Swap Sort algorithm, which is to find the missing number. If at index = i, we do not have i + 1, that means i + 1 is the missing number. And because we are asked to find the first positive missing number, as soon as we find a missing number, that will be the first/smallest so we can return.\\n\\nSo, in [1,-1,3,4] we will see that at index = 1, we should have 2 but instead there is -1. This means 2 is missing. So return 2.\\n\\n# **SPECIAL CASES**\\n\\nThere will be cases where we have arrays like - \\n\\n    [1]\\n\\nAnd in this case, smallest positive missing number is 2. That\\'s because as we know, positive range is from 1 to 2^31 - 1.

                "content": "**Clearing problem description:**\\n- Problem is asking you to find the number \"starting from 1\" which is missing. For example:\\n- - [1,2,0], we are ignoring numbers<=0 so if we write this in order we get \"1 2\" here 3 is first missing positive\\n- - [3,4,-1,1] , writing this in order we get \"1 3 4\" and thus 2 is first missing positive\\n- - [7,8,9,10], starting from 1, here 1 is first missing positive\\n\\n**Solution:**\\nI am going to give you an O(3n) solution but using this similarly you can get the O(2n) solution. Note that both are O(n) solution\\n\\nTake N = length of array\\nFirst of all in array, set all \"zero and numbers greater than N\" to -1 since they are no use to us. I will tell you later why I chose -1.\\n\\nNow for all positive numbers \"p\" left in the array, we will set array[p-1] = 0, but before doing so we should also take care of the number present in (p-1)th position.\\nHere 0 implies that number p is present in the array. So later when we see 0 at index i in array we can say that i+1 is definitely present in the array. \\nAfter settings zeros, the first missing number will be:  index(\"non zero number\") +1\\nIf all are zeros then first missing number will be len(array)+1\\n\\nFor example: [3,4,-1,1] ,\\nApplying above procedure:\\n- when i=0 --> [3 4 0 1]\\n- when i =1 -->[3 4 0 0] --> [0 4 0 0]\\n- when i=2 since idx<0 pass\\n- when i=3 since idx<0 pass\\nwe get [0 4 0 0] so first missing is 2\\n\\n**Algorithm(pseudocode):**\\n\\nFor i in ( 0 to length(array)-1 )\\n**{**\\n\\n p = array[i];  \\n Index idx = p-1;\\n\\nwhile(idx>=0 and idx<length(array)) {\\n* store the value at idx to a variable temp. i.e. temp = array[idx]\\n* Set array[idx] = 0.  \\n* Jump to temp-1 location by doing idx=temp-1 \\n}\\n\\n**}**\\n\\nSo what will happen is that for all the positive numbers the inner loop will jump and set array[idx]=0 for numbers in the array. When temp<=0 then idx=temp-1<0, so inner loop will break. This is why I set useless items to -1.\\nOuter loop will ensure that no numbers are left out.\\n\\nTime complexity is O(3n) because setting all \"zero and numbers greater than N\" to -1 takes O(n),\\nouter loop takes O(n)\\nInner jumps will be at max O(n) because after setting all positive number\\'s corresponding indexes to 0 there will be no jump.\\n\\n**Python code:**\\n```\\ndef firstMissingPositive(self, nums):\\n\\tif not nums:\\n\\t    return 1\\n\\n\\tN = len(nums)\\n\\tfor i in xrange(len(nums)):\\n\\t    if nums[i] ==0 or nums[i] > N:\\n\\t        nums[i] = -1\\n\\tfor i in xrange(len(nums)):\\n\\t    idx = nums[i]-1\\n\\t    while(idx>=0 and idx<N):\\n\\t        tmp = nums[idx]\\n\\t        nums[idx] = 0\\n\\t        idx = tmp-1\\n\\tfor i in xrange(len(nums)):\\n\\t    if nums[i] != 0:\\n\\t        return i+1\\n\\treturn len(nums)+1\\n```\\n\\nThe O(2n) method involves setting array[idx] = idx+1 and breaking the inner while loop when array[idx] = idx+1 is already set",

Then scan from left to right to find smallest index without presence.\\n\\n`eg. nums = [3, 4, -1, 1]`\\n\\nFirst, since `nums` is of size n, we know the first missing positive will be in the range [1, n + 1].

If we go through this loop without finding a positive value, then `n + 1` must be the first missing positive.\\n\\n`[-3, 4, -5, -1] -> return 2 ( i = 1)`\\n\\n**Code:**\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        n = len(nums)\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            if not (0 < nums[i] <= n):\\n                nums[i] = n + 1\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            x = abs(nums[i])\\n            if 0 < x <= n:\\n                nums[x - 1] = abs(nums[x - 1]) * -1\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            if nums[i] > 0:\\n                return i + 1\\n        return n + 1\\n```\\nPS. This relies on something I\\'ll call inverse pigeonhole principle. If there are n values from [1, m], and each x \\u2208 [1, m] is put into index x - 1 of m containers with n <= m, then at least one container will not have anything, or m + 1 will be the smallest container we have to add that will not have anything.",

                "content": "If we have an array of length n we know \"smallest missing positive integer\" must be in between 1 and n+1(inclusive).\\n\\nFor example:\\n[3,1,2,8,9] in this case we have an array of length n=5, so our smallest missing positive integer must lie between 1 and 5+1 = 6(inclusive).\\n\\nClearly, those values that are greater than n(5) should not be in here. Because if we have any value greater than n those values are occupying some samller values place. For example, 8 is occupying index 3 where we should have either 4 or 5 and also 9 is occupying index 4 where we should have either 5 or 4.\\n\\nThe same goes for any value less than or equal to 0.\\n\\nFor example:\\n[-1,-2,3,1,2]\\n-1 is at index 0 where we should either 4 or 5, the same is true for -2 as well.\\n\\nSo, values that are >n and <=0 are all garbage. We don\\'t need those.\\n\\nLet\\'s modify the array:\\n[3,1,2,8,9] will become [3,1,2,1,1]\\n[-1,-2,3,1,2] will become [1,1,3,1,2]\\n\\nWhy are we putting 1 in place of those values?\\n\\nWe know that, 1 is the smallest positive integer from 1 to infinity.\\n\\nSo if our array does not contain 1 then we know for sure that 1 is going to be the answer. There is no point checking further.\\n\\nBut, if we do have 1 as an item inside the array then some other value[ >1 && <=n ] inside the array which is missing will be the answer. If none are missing then n+1 will be the answer.\\n\\nWith that in mind when we see any garbage value that should not be in this array we replace that value with 1, which we already knew is present in the array. Between garbage value and 1, only 1 is allowed to be present in our modified array.\\n\\nOnce we are done processing our array, we know all the values inside the array should lie between 1 & n(inclusive).\\n\\nOne more processing needs to happen before we look for the answer.\\nAs an easier example, let\\'s say after processing up till this point we got an array like this:\\n[1,2,3,3]\\nIn an ideal case we should have had [1,2,3,4], if all the values were present. Now in this case which one is not present? How can you tell? \\nIf we take each value of each index and update the corresponding value to it\\'s negative then we will have an array like this [-1,-2,-3,3].\\nHow? Take i=2, update whatever is present to negative:\\n```\\n                int index = Math.abs(nums[i])-1;\\n                nums[index] = -Math.abs(nums[index]);\\n```\\n[1,2,2,3] , similarly:\\n[-1,-2,-2,3]\\n\\nAfter that, we will check for the first index where the value is still positive. Our answer will be that index+1.\\n\\nIf this is not the case then our answer will be n+1 since all the values between 1 and n are present in the array.\\n\\nHope this will help anyone who is not looking for code but explanation.\\n\\n**Still need the solution? \\nhttps://nextswe.com/leetcode-41-first-missing-positive/ \\nCode is at the bottom of the explanation.**",

So ***return i+1***.\\n- Still, we iterate all elements and didn\\u2019t find the ans that means elements are from 1 to n, in the array, so return ***n+1***.\\n- **Time complexity:** O(n).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Code:\\n\\n```cpp\\n//Solution 01:\\n**class Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int mn=INT_MAX;\\n        int n=nums.size();\\n        \\n        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){\\n            if(nums[i]>0 && mn>nums[i])\\n                mn = nums[i];\\n            if(nums[i]<1 || nums[i]>n) \\n                nums[i]=1;\\n        }\\n        if(mn > 1)\\n            return 1;\\n        \\n        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){\\n            if(nums[abs(nums[i])-1]>0) \\n                nums[abs(nums[i])-1] *= -1;            \\n        }\\n        \\n        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){\\n            if(nums[i]>0) return i+1;\\n        }\\n        \\n        return n+1;\\n    }\\n};**\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n> **Please upvote this solution**\\n>",

                "content": "For an array size of ```N```, we have that the first missing positive is between ```0``` and ```N+1```. This may take some time to think about but the best case is you have all the positive integers from ```0``` to ```N```, in which case the answer is ```N+1```. If you change any one of those values to something greater than ```N``` or less than ```0```, then the answer will be between ```0``` and ```N+1```. So this property holds.\\n\\nWe can abuse this property. Any number less than ```0``` and greater than ```N+1``` will not be inside this range. So we can iterate through and change these values to ```N+1``` (to keep it simple, but they need to be set to something that is at least ```N+1``` or bigger) since they are useless to us.\\n\\nThe next step is to iterate through the array again and use a simple hack: treat the numbers as indicies. We index the array using this value and we make the indexed value negative to \"tick\" it off. We need to remember to take the absoloute value every time we calculate the index because we are using the array for two purposes: to keep track which ones we tick off, and which ones we need to tick off still. This may be a little unintitive so here is how I thought about it (using an extrra array for visual purposes only):\\n\\nStarting array: ```[-5, 2, 3, 5, 1, 8]```\\nTicked off (```#``` is none, ```-``` is ticked): ```[#,#,#,#,#,#]```\\n\\nAfter setting to ```N+1```: ```[7, 2, 3, 5, 1, 7]```\\nTicked off: ```[#,#,#,#,#,#]```\\n\\nWe index ```nums[abs(7-1)]``` which is invalid. So we have\\nArray: ```[7, 2, 3, 5, 1, 7]```\\nTicked off: ```[#,#,#,#,#,#]```\\n\\n\\nWe index ```nums[abs(2)-1]``` which is ```2```. So we have\\nArray: ```[7, -2, 3, 5, 1, 7]```\\nTicked off: ```[#,-,#,#,#,#]```\\n\\nWe index ```nums[abs(3)-1]``` which is ```3```. So we have\\nArray: ```[7, -2, -3, 5, 1, 7]```\\nTicked off: ```[#,-,-,#,#,#]```\\n\\nWe index ```nums[abs(5)-1]``` which is ```1```. So we have\\nArray: ```[7, -2, -3, 5, -1, 7]```\\nTicked off: ```[#,-,-,#,-,#]```\\n\\nWe index ```nums[abs(-1)-1]``` which is ```7```. So we have\\nArray: ```[-7, -2, -3, 5, -1, 7]```\\nTicked off: ```[-,-,-,#,-,#]```\\n\\nWe index ```nums[abs(7)-1]``` which is not valid. So we have\\nArray: ```[-7, -2, -3, 5, 1, 7]```\\nTicked off: ```[-,-,-,#,-,#]```\\n\\nWe can see from the example that the ticked array matches the signs in the original array.\\n\\nWe finally iterate through the array (the index of the array starts at ```1``` for this problem) and return the first index that has a positive number. This will be the first number that has not been ticked off yet. So in the example, we would return ```4``` as ```nums[4]=5``` is not ticked off.\\n\\nHere is the code for reference:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int negatives = nums.size()-1;\\n        \\n        // change all negative numbers and numbers bigger than N \\n\\t\\t// (the amount of elements in the list)\\n        for (int i = nums.size()-1; i >= 0; i--){\\n            if (nums[i] <= 0 || nums[i] > nums.size()){\\n                nums[i] = nums.size()+1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        int min = 1;\\n        \\n        // use nums[i] as the index and mark them off\\n        for (int i =0; i < nums.size(); i++){\\n            int index = abs(nums[i])-1;\\n            \\n            // check to see if it\\'s within the bounds and indexable\\n\\t\\t\\t// and check to not tick off the same value twice\\n            if ((index < nums.size() && index >= 0) && nums[index] > 0){\\n                nums[index] = -nums[index];\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        // first positive value not ticked off \\n        for (min = 0; min < nums.size(); min++){\\n            if (nums[min] > 0){\\n                break;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return min+1;\\n        \\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "Solving this in O(n) time was tricky, but solving it in O(1) space was arguably more difficult.\\n\\n**Constraints:**\\n1. Can\\'t use an object to store values because that would no longer be constant extra space (as the size of the object would be dependent on the number of values in the array).\\n2.   For the same reason, we can\\'t iniitalize another array.\\n\\n**Possible Scenarios:**\\n1: Array has negative and/or positive values but does not contain the integer 1.  In that case, result would be 1.\\n2: Array contains the integer 1 and has one or more missing integers within the array.  In that case, we need to be able to tell where that gap is.\\n3: Array contains only positive integers and contains 1 through the length of the array.  In that case, result would be array length + 1.\\n\\n**Observations:**\\n1. If there are no gaps, the largest value for an integer in the array is the length of the array.\\n2. That means that we don\\'t care about any values that are greater than the length of the array (because they wouldn\\'t affect the calculation of what the smallest integer missing would be as their inclusion would ensure a gap elsewhere)\\n3. If the lowest value we care about is 1 and the largest value we care about is the length of the array, we can iterate through the array and swap the value at the current index to the index of the value - 1 in order to track whether or not a given value exists in the array.  That is, given an array [3, 2, 1], swapping 3 with 1, not incrementing the iterator so that you are still looking at the array at index 0, seeing that 1 is in place, incrementing the index, seeing that 2 is in place, incrementing the index, and seeing that 3 is in place.  We would then loop through the array a second time in order to find the lowest value that isn\\'t at the index of its value - 1.\\n\\n**Big O Analysis:**\\nThis function goes through the array, swapping the value at the current index with the value at the index of one less than the value.  If the value is less than 0 or greater than the length of the array, the value at that index gets set to 0 to make it easier on the eyes during debugging of edge cases.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s employing a for loop and a while loop in the first pass, it\\'s not nested in the sense that two counters are going as it\\'s utilizing the same counter for both, so I believe that portion is still O(n), and tacking on the for loop at the end to determine whether or not an integer is present in the array wouldn\\'t be significant enough to affect the time complexity.\\n\\nAs we\\'re utilizing the original array and just changing pointer values and not actually moving the array in any way, this should still be O(1) space complexity.\\n\\n```\\nvar firstMissingPositive = function (nums) {\\n  let current;\\n  let indexForCurrent;\\n   for (let i = 0; i < nums.length;) {\\n    if (nums[i] < 0) {\\n      nums[i] = 0;\\n      i++;\\n    } else if (nums[i] > nums.length){\\n      i++;\\n    }\\n      current = nums[i];     \\n      indexForCurrent = current - 1\\n      while (nums[i] != nums[indexForCurrent]) {\\n        if (current > 0 && current <= nums.length) {\\n          let next = nums[indexForCurrent];\\n          nums[indexForCurrent] = current;\\n          nums[i] = next;\\n          current = nums[i];\\n          indexForCurrent = current - 1;\\n        } else {\\n          nums[i] = 0;\\n          i++;\\n          current = nums[i];\\n          indexForCurrent = current - 1;           \\n      }\\n    }\\n    i++;\\n  }\\n  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\\n    if (nums[i] !== i + 1) {\\n      return i + 1;\\n    }\\n  }\\n  return nums.length + 1\\n};\\n```",

You should only go through the numbers then get the result.\\n 2. no extra memory, means you can not use bit vector to indicate if any number exists.\\n\\nSo, the first idea came into my mind is bit manipulation. But, after tried and thought it again, bit manipulation doesn't help here. Because the numbers can be duplicated. Re-visited the problem, I found one critical point: it's asking the smallest missing positive number. It means I can reorder the numbers to let the nums[0]=1, nums[1]=2... etc. Actually, I spent more than 30 minutes on bit manipulation direction. Once I found the solution, it only took about 10 minutes to code.\\n\\n    class Solution {\\n    public:\\n    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int size=nums.size();\\n        for(int i=0; i<size;){\\n            if(nums[i]>0 && nums[i]<=size && nums[i]!=nums[nums[i]-1]){\\n                swap(nums[i], nums[nums[i]-1]);\\n            }\\n            else{\\n                ++i;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        int i=0;\\n        for(; i<size && nums[i]==i+1; ++i);\\n        return i+1;\\n    }};",

So if the elements in the input array are single digit integers in the **range [-9,9]** then essentially  radix sort and bucket sort are similar.\\n\\nBucket sort is the best sorting technique that might be used here because when the **input is uniformly** **distributed over a range**(here the elements of the input array are in range [-9,9]) bucket sort performs in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.\\n\\n**Counting sort** -- simple buckets, simple processing, memory overhead, performs well when input has many duplicates.\\n\\n**Radix sort** -- simple buckets, sophisticated processing, speed overhead (and still need additional static memory)\\n\\n**Bucket sort** -- sophisticated buckets, simple processing, requires dynamic memory, good in average compared to counting and radix sorts.\\n\\n\\n     class Solution {\\n        public:\\n            int firstMissingPositive(int A[], int n) {\\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)\\n                {\\n                    int digit = A[i];\\n                    while (digit <= n && digit > 0 && A[digit - 1] != digit)\\n                    {\\n                        swap(A[digit - 1], A[i]);\\n                        digit = A[i];\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)\\n                {\\n                    if (A[i] != i + 1)\\n                    {\\n                        return i + 1;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                return n + 1;\\n            }\\n        };",

                "content": "Hello World ! \\nFirst Approach I used is pretty simple and it\\'s time complexity is O(n)\\n\\n**Steps**\\n1. Traverse the input array and replace all zeroes and negative number by INT_MAX\\n2. Traverse the input array again, and during this traversal we will find the correct position of each element by making value at that index negative.\\n3. During final traversal, return the  (index+1) where \"index\" is the first index at which element found is positive.\\n\\n```\\n\\tint n=v.size();\\n    int ans=0;\\n\\t\\n\\t// step 1 - Replacing zeroes and negative numbers with INT_MAX\\n    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)\\n    if(v[i]<1) v[i]=INT_MAX;\\n\\t\\n\\t// step 2 - Finding correct position of each element.\\n    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)\\n        if(abs(v[i])<=n)\\n        v[abs(v[i])-1] = min(v[abs(v[i])-1],-v[abs(v[i])-1]);\\n    \\n    // step 3 - Returning (index+1) , where \"index\" is the first index at which element found is positive\\n\\tfor(;ans<n;ans++)\\n        if(v[ans]>0) return ans+1;\\n    return ans+1;\\n```\\n\\n**Second Approach**\\n\\nAlthough the above approach was working very good in terms of space and time. But i still went on to look for some other way of solving it, the way through which no one has ever done this yet.\\nThen, the idea of **heap**  crossed my mind.\\n Overall Time complexity i guess would be approx - O(n*logn)\\n\\n1. By using heapify, i convert the same array into min heap.\\n2. Initialised ```ans=1```   \\n3. Now compare with the root of min heap (root of min heap is arr[0])\\n\\t* If the root of min heap (i.e arr[0]) is equal to ans, then ans is incremented.\\n\\t* If the root of min heap is greater than ans, the ans is returned.\\n\\nSee the code and its comments for better understanding.\\n\\n**Iterative Min Heapify Function**\\n```\\nvoid minheapify(vector<int>&a,int i,int n){\\n    while(i<=n){\\n    int l= 2*i+1;\\n    int r=2*i+2;\\n    int largest =i;\\n    if(l<n  && a[l]<a[largest])\\n    largest=l;\\n    if(r<n && a[r]<a[largest])\\n    largest=r;\\n     if(largest!=i){\\n        swap(a[i],a[largest]);\\n        i=largest;\\n    }\\n    else break;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Driver Code**\\n```\\nint n=v.size();\\n       \\n        int ans=1;\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t//Heapify the input array\\n        for(int i = (n/2)-1;i>-1;i--)\\n            minheapify(v,i,n); \\n  \\n    while(n>0){\\n\\t// Comparing root with the ans\\n        if(ans==v[0]) ans++;\\n        else if(ans<v[0]) break;\\n        v[0]=v[n-1];\\n        n--;\\n        minheapify(v,0,n);\\n    }\\n\\t\\n\\treturn ans;   // Final answer returned\\n```\\n\\nI know the first approach was way better. But you know, one should try to solve the question with other approaches too. \\n\\nOpen for suggestions, edits and improvements.\\nPlease **Upvote** if you like.\\nThanks,\\n**Aadi**\\n",

                "content": "1. **Clean the array:** We want to ignore numbers that are not useful for us. So, we go through our list (nums) one by one.If a number is zero or negative, or if it\\'s greater than m (our total number of elements), we consider it not useful and replace it with zero. This simplifies our task because we only care about positive integers up to m.\\n\\n* 2. **Put numbers to their place using cyclic sort i.e swap until you find the number :** (This works because of **[Pigeonhole Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle)**) : The Pigeonhole Principle states that if you have more \"pigeons\" than \"pigeonholes,\" at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this context:\\n* \\n* The \"pigeons\" are the positive integers from 1 to m (where m is the size of the input array nums).\\n* The \"pigeonholes\" are the indices of the array nums.\\n* The goal in this problem is to find the first missing positive integer. If there are no missing positive integers in the range from 1 to m, then all the pigeons are already in their correct pigeonholes, and no pigeonhole contains more than one pigeon.\\n* * So Now, we want to arrange the remaining positive integers in the correct order from 1 to m. We do this using a technique called cyclic sort. \\n* * We go through our list again, and for each number: If it\\'s not zero (useful) and not already in the right place (not equal to i + 1), we swap it with the number in its rightful position, which is nums[i] - 1. We repeat this until we can\\'t swap anymore.\\n\\n3. **Finding the First Missing Positive:** \\n* * Once we\\'ve sorted our list, we go through it one more time to find the first number that\\'s not in its expected position.\\n* * The first missing positive integer is equal to i + 1 (because we\\'re looking for the number that should be in the i-th position of our sorted list).\\n* * If we don\\'t find any missing positive integers in the range from 1 to m, we return m + 1, indicating that all positive integers up to m are present in the list.\\n\\n**If you liked the solution.

                "content": "# Introduction\\nThis particular problem is much easier than it would usually be, as the problem\\u2019s description specifies the required time and space complexity, limiting the possible approaches.</br>\\nHowever, in the actual interview, you would likely be given a problem without specified constraints and solution time-space complexity. \\n* You should ask about input value constraints before proceeding to solve the problem. \\n* Optimal time-space complexity should be achieved in the solving process, starting with a brute-force solution and further seeking ways to optimize the process.</br>\\n\\n# Brute-Force solution\\nThe solution that comes to mind first consists of checking the presence in `nums` of every positive integer in ascending order, starting with *1*. The number of checks is limited by *N + 1*, because the lowest positive missing integer lies within the range *[1, \\u2026, N + 1]* for an array of length *N*, as the missing value would be *N + 1* if all values in *[1, \\u2026, n]* are present in `nums` once, and missing value would be in *[1, \\u2026, n]* otherwise.\\n## Code\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n\\n\\t\\t# check presence of each value in [1, ..., N]\\n\\t\\t# missing value is N + 1 if every previous value is present\\n        for v in range(1, len(nums)):\\n\\n            if v not in nums:\\n                return v\\n\\n        return v + 1\\n```\\n## Complexity analysis\\nLet *N* be the length of the `nums` array, and *O(M)* be the time complexity of finding whether a certain number is present in the array.</br>\\nNote that linear search in an array takes *O(N)* time because it is conducted by iterating through the whole array until the number is found, meaning *O(M) = O(N)*\\n* Time Complexity: *O(N<sup>2</sup>)*\\nFor each number in *[1, \\u2026 N]*, we spend *O(M)* time to check whether it is present in `nums`</br>\\nIn total, we have *O(N \\\\* M) = O(N<sup>2</sup>))*</br>\\n\\n* Space Complexity: *O(1)*\\nWe use constant extra space to store a fixed number of variables to account for the currently processed number.\\n\\n# Sorting solution\\nAnother simple solution lies in sorting the array and iterating through it until we reach the last non-positive number and further checking that every positive number is present in the sorted array.\\n## Code:\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n\\n        # sort nums\\n        nums.sort()\\n        cur = 0\\n        \\n        for idx, val in enumerate(nums):\\n            # skip the negatives\\n            if val <= 0:\\n                continue\\n\\n            # check that next value in sorted nums contains\\n            # number that immeadiately follows it or is equal to it\\n            # set current lowest positive to one that we checked\\n            elif val == cur or val == cur + 1:\\n                cur = val\\n           \\n           # break cycle if there is a gap of more than 1 between two\\n           # neighbouring values in sorted nums\\n           else:\\n                break\\n\\n        return cur + 1\\n```\\n## Complexity analysis\\nLet *N* be the length of the `nums` array.\\n* Time Complexity: *O(N \\\\* logN)*\\nQuicksort is generally considered the fastest among the usual sorting algorithms since its time complexity is *O(N \\\\* logN)* on average for a randomly sampled array. However, most programming languages use some sort of hybrid, heavily optimized algorithm as their native sort. Usually, the native sorting algorithms are the fastest, but their average time complexity is *O(N \\\\* logN)*.\\nFor each in `nums[i]`, we check whether the value is positive and equal to the previous or bigger by one.</br>\\nIn total we have *O(N \\\\* logN + N \\\\* M) = O(N \\\\* logN + N) = O(N \\\\* logN)*</br>\\n\\n* Space Complexity: *O(1)*\\nWe use constant extra space to store a fixed number of variables to account for the current number we search for. Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning that it uses no extra space.</br>\\nHowever, if you use native to your preferred language sorting algorithm, it may use a linear extra space in a worst-case scenario.\\n# Hash-Table solution\\nThe pros of using a hash table are that hash tables are implemented in such a way that adding, searching for, and deleting a value is done within average and amortized *O(1)* time. The solution lies in iterating through `nums` and adding every positive integer to the hash table, and then checking for the presence in the hash table of every positive integer in ascending order.\\n## Code:\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n\\n        # create hash table\\n        present_values = set()\\n\\n        # add every value from nums to hash table\\n        for v in nums:\\n            if v > 0:\\n                present_values.add(v)\\n        \\n        # searching for lowest missing value, starting with 1\\n        cur = 1\\n        \\n        while cur in present_values:\\n            cur += 1\\n\\n        return cur\\n```\\n## Complexity analysis\\nLet *N* be the length of the `nums` array, and *O(M)* be the time complexity of finding whether a certain positive number is present in the hash table.\\n* Time Complexity: *O(N)*\\nFor each `nums[i]`, we add its value to the hash table in *O(1)* time. For values in the range *[1, \\u2026, N]*, we check whether they are present in the hash table in *O(M)* time.</br>\\nIn total we have *O(N \\\\* 1 + N \\\\* M) = O(N + N \\\\* 1) = O(N)*</br>\\n* Space Complexity: *O(N)*\\nWe use linear extra space to store the hash table (some of the values in `nums` are stored in the hash table). Not knowing the exact number of positive integers in `nums`, in the worst-case scenario, all values in `nums` will be positive), and thus hash table stores a certain percentage *P* of values in `nums`.</br>\\nNote that *O(P / 100 * N) = O(N)*\\n# Final solution\\nThere are a couple of constraints to the problem, which will help us find the right solution:\\n* We need to store somehow information about the existence of a certain positive number\\n* According to the problem\\u2019s formulation, we can not use additional space to store this information.\\n* We can not sort the `nums` array to store information in an intuitive ascending way because of the time complexity constraints which do not allow for sorting.\\n\\nThe only way to store all necessary information is in the `nums` array itself, and here is how we will do it. \\n1. We could use the cell at the index that corresponds to a specific value *v* to store information about the value *v* so that `nums[v]`, which contains some value *k*, will represent the existence of *v*, yet still containing information about the *k* value.\\n2. Since we only care about the positive numbers, upon reaching value *v*, we could make the value in `nums[v]` a negative value of the same power, `nums[v] = -nums[v]`. But you can already see some flaws in this approach:\\n\\n\\t* In case `nums[v] = 0`, then `-nums[v] = 0` as well, not reflecting the existence of *v*.\\n\\t* Negative integers could already be present in `nums`, confusing the algorithm, such as in the following case, say there is no value *v* in `nums`, but `nums[i] = -2`, then the algorithm would think that *v* was present in `nums`.\\n\\t* Large values greater than the highest index in `nums` can also be present in `nums`, calling for runtime errors.\\n3. Let us try to fix these issues:\\n\\t* In case `nums[v] = 0`: Since zero is not a positive integer, we do not care about its existence. We can replace it with any number that we know exists in `nums`, as adding a number already present in `nums` will not reflect on the lowest missing integer. The number that surely is the number *v* that we are processing at the moment `nums[v] = 0 => nums[v] = -v`.\\n\\t* Since the presence of negative values is irrelevant to us (we are looking for the lowest positive integer), we can replace all negatives with zeroes, especially since we have already solved the \\u2018zero\\u2019 problem.\\n\\t* As explained in the brute-force approach, missing values is in the range *[1, \\u2026, N + 1]* thus, we can ignore all values greater than *N* (if all values in *[1, \\u2026, N]* are present in `nums`, then *N + 1* is the lowest missing, thus no need to store information about *N + 1*), or perhaps more conveniently replace them with zeroes\\n4. And lastly, for convenience, to avoid messing with indices, we will add another zero value at the end of the array to represent the existence of value *N*; consequently, `nums[N]` will not present us with a runtime error.\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/aefd3524-2345-4bbf-a834-5c4af0807abb_1661287627.2233372.gif)\\n## Code:\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        # add zero value to the end to avoid messing with indices\\n        nums.append(0)\\n\\n        # nums preprocessing\\n        for idx, num in enumerate(nums):\\n            if nums[idx] <= 0 or nums[idx] >= len(nums):\\n                nums[idx] = 0\\n\\n        # getting nums to store information about the existence of processed positive integer\\n        for idx, num in enumerate(nums):\\n            i = abs(num)\\n\\n            if nums[i] == 0:\\n                nums[i] = -i\\n            else:\\n                nums[i] = -abs(nums[i])\\n\\n        idx = 1\\n\\n        # finding lowest positive integer that is missing from nums\\n        while idx < len(nums) and nums[idx] < 0:\\n            idx += 1\\n\\n        return idx\\n```\\n## Complexity analysis\\nLet *N* be the length of the `nums` array.\\n* Time Complexity: *O(N \\\\* logN)*\\nFor each `nums[i]`, we check whether it is negative or larger than *N* and replace it with zero if the condition is true in *O(N)* time.

It involves rearranging the elements in the array by swapping them into their correct positions.\\n\\nThe algorithm works as follows:\\n1. Iterate through the array from the start.\\n2. Check if the current number, X[i], is within the range of 1 to n and if it is not already present at index X[i] - 1.\\n3. If the conditions are met, swap X[i] with the number present at the index X[i] - 1.\\n4. Continue the process until the array is fully traversed.\\n\\nAfter the sorting is done, the next step is to scan the modified array again to find the first index where X[i] is not equal to i + 1. This indicates the presence of a missing positive number. If such an index is found, return i + 1 as the first missing positive. If no such index is found, it means all numbers from 1 to n are present in the array, so return the value n + 1 as the first missing positive.\\n\\nThis algorithm solves the problem in-place, meaning it rearranges the elements within the original array without requiring additional space.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(n)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(1)\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int i = 0;\\n        while(i<nums.size()){\\n            if(nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] <= nums.size() && nums[nums[i]-1] != nums[i]){\\n                swap(nums[i], nums[nums[i]-1]);\\n            }\\n            else{\\n                i++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {\\n            if(nums[i] != i+1){\\n                return i+1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return nums.size() + 1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "# Explanation\\nThe idea is to use the index of the array to store the value of the number in the array. For example, if the input array is [3, 4, -1, 1], we can use the index 0 to store 1, index 1 to store 2, index 2 to store 3 and so on.\\n\\nTo do this, we need to first separate the positive numbers from the negative numbers. Then, for each positive number, we use its value as the index to store its corresponding value in the array.\\n\\nAfter separating the positive numbers and rearranging the array, the first missing positive number will be the first position in the array that does not contain its corresponding value.\\n\\n# Use of Loops\\nIn the first loop, we separate the positive numbers from the negative numbers. We use while loop to swap the value of the current number with its corresponding value in the array until the current number is not in its correct position.\\n\\nIn the second loop, we find the first missing positive number. The first position in the array that does not contain its corresponding value is the first missing positive number. If all the positions contain their corresponding values, then the missing positive number is n+1.\\n\\nHere is the code in C++:\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n=nums.size();\\n        // separate the positive numbers from the negative numbers\\n        for (int i=0;i<n;i++) \\n            while (nums[i]>0 && nums[i]<=n && nums[nums[i]-1]!=nums[i])\\n                swap(nums[i],nums[nums[i]-1]);\\n        // find the first missing positive number\\n        for (int i=0;i<n;i++)\\n            if (nums[i]!=i+1)\\n                return i+1;\\n        return n+1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "Firstly, we need to understand that **answer is going to lie among the first n + 1 positive integers**: \\nReason: \\nThe array can have at most n unique positive integers. Now if any of the positive numbers in the range [1, n] are missing in the array then our answer will be the smallest of those. In case all the integers in the range [1, n] are present, then the array has all its indices filled with the integers in the range[1, n] and so the answer will be n + 1.\\n\\nNow I think the easiest approach to come up with is to use a HashMap or HashSet to store the elements of the array and then check for the first n + 1 integers if they are present or not. Even though this approach is O(n) in time, it is pretty slow, because of the time it takes for the hashing operation. Also, the space complexity of the solution is O(n). As clearly mentioned in the problem statement, we can do better. \\n\\nThe main idea of the above approach was to somehow distinguish between the numbers that are present in the array vs the numbers that are not present in the array.\\n\\nWe can still use the same idea but implement it in a better way. \\n\\nFor every element in the array, if it is in not in the range[1, n] we can replace it with n + 2, since these numbers don\\'t really matter. \\nNow the array consists of elements that are either in the range [1, n] or n + 2.\\nFor every element in the array that is in the range [1, n], we can make the element in the array at (position = element - 1) negative\\ni.e. make sure that arr[arr[i] - 1] is negative for every i such that arr[i] belongs to [1, n].\\nthis way we would be able to distinguish between elements that are present in the array ( as for x, in range [1, n] if it is present in the array then arr[x - 1] would be negative, otherwise it will be positive), vs the numbers that are not present in the array. We can then loop from 1 to n, and then check if the corresponding index is negative or positive to check if the element exists in the array.\\n\\nMy Code:\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n = nums.size();\\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)\\n            if(nums[i] <= 0 || nums[i] > n)\\n                nums[i] = n + 2;\\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){\\n            if(abs(nums[i]) == n + 2)\\n                continue;\\n            if(nums[abs(nums[i]) - 1] > 0)\\n                nums[abs(nums[i]) - 1] *= -1;\\n        }\\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){\\n            if(nums[i] > 0)\\n                return i + 1;\\n        }\\n        return n + 1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

If a positive integer is not in the given array it, the missing integer *must* be in the range `[1..n]`. This is the crucial observation we use to deduce the algorithm.\\n\\nSo, If an integer is missing it must be in the range `[1..n]`, if an integer is not missing then the answer is `n+1`.\\n\\nI\\'ll try my best to explain why.\\n\\nLet\\'s picture the only two possibilities:\\n\\n1. There is no missing integer in the array\\n2. There is a missing integer in the array.\\n\\nIf there is *no* missing integers, this means that the array has all number from 1 to n. This must mean that the array is full. Why, because in the range [1..n] there are exactly n numbers, and if you place n numbers in an array of length n, the array is by definition full. (in this case the solution is to return n+1 which is the first smallest integer).\\n\\nOnce you understand the first case above understanding the second is easy. If there *is* a missing integer (or more than one), the missing integer(s), let\\'s call it X, must be in the range 1..n.

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive.

This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

If a positive integer is not in the given array it, the missing integer *must* be in the range `[1..n]`. This is the crucial observation we use to deduce the algorithm.\\n\\nSo, If an integer is missing it must be in the range `[1..n]`, if an integer is not missing then the answer is `n+1`.\\n\\nI\\'ll try my best to explain why.\\n\\nLet\\'s picture the only two possibilities:\\n\\n1. There is no missing integer in the array\\n2. There is a missing integer in the array.\\n\\nIf there is *no* missing integers, this means that the array has all number from 1 to n. This must mean that the array is full. Why, because in the range [1..n] there are exactly n numbers, and if you place n numbers in an array of length n, the array is by definition full. (in this case the solution is to return n+1 which is the first smallest integer).\\n\\nOnce you understand the first case above understanding the second is easy. If there *is* a missing integer (or more than one), the missing integer(s), let\\'s call it X, must be in the range 1..n. Why, because if the missing integer X is *not* in the range [1..n] that would imply that all integers [1..n] are in the array, which would mean that the array is full, leaving no space to place X (since X is not in the range [1..n]).\\n\\nThen the algorithm becomes:\\n\\n1. Ignore all numbers <=0 and >n since they are outside the range of possible answers (which we proved was [1..n]). We do this by replacing them with the value n+1.\\n1. For all other integers <n+1, mark their bucket (cell) to indicate the integer exists. (\\\\*see below)\\n1. Find the first cell not marked, that is the first missing integer. If you did not find an unmarked cell, there was no missing integer, so return n+1.\\n\\n\\\\*I recommend looking at this solution for a very smart way to mark the cells:\\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/discuss/17214/Java-simple-solution-with-documentation\\n\\n[**Note**: I find the use of the words *first missing integer* misleading.

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

If a positive integer is not in the given array it, the missing integer *must* be in the range `[1..n]`. This is the crucial observation we use to deduce the algorithm.\\n\\nSo, If an integer is missing it must be in the range `[1..n]`, if an integer is not missing then the answer is `n+1`.\\n\\nI\\'ll try my best to explain why.\\n\\nLet\\'s picture the only two possibilities:\\n\\n1. There is no missing integer in the array\\n2. There is a missing integer in the array.\\n\\nIf there is *no* missing integers, this means that the array has all number from 1 to n. This must mean that the array is full. Why, because in the range [1..n] there are exactly n numbers, and if you place n numbers in an array of length n, the array is by definition full. (in this case the solution is to return n+1 which is the first smallest integer).\\n\\nOnce you understand the first case above understanding the second is easy. If there *is* a missing integer (or more than one), the missing integer(s), let\\'s call it X, must be in the range 1..n. Why, because if the missing integer X is *not* in the range [1..n] that would imply that all integers [1..n] are in the array, which would mean that the array is full, leaving no space to place X (since X is not in the range [1..n]).\\n\\nThen the algorithm becomes:\\n\\n1. Ignore all numbers <=0 and >n since they are outside the range of possible answers (which we proved was [1..n]). We do this by replacing them with the value n+1.\\n1. For all other integers <n+1, mark their bucket (cell) to indicate the integer exists. (\\\\*see below)\\n1. Find the first cell not marked, that is the first missing integer. If you did not find an unmarked cell, there was no missing integer, so return n+1.\\n\\n\\\\*I recommend looking at this solution for a very smart way to mark the cells:\\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/discuss/17214/Java-simple-solution-with-documentation\\n\\n[**Note**: I find the use of the words *first missing integer* misleading.

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

If a positive integer is not in the given array it, the missing integer *must* be in the range `[1..n]`. This is the crucial observation we use to deduce the algorithm.\\n\\nSo, If an integer is missing it must be in the range `[1..n]`, if an integer is not missing then the answer is `n+1`.\\n\\nI\\'ll try my best to explain why.\\n\\nLet\\'s picture the only two possibilities:\\n\\n1. There is no missing integer in the array\\n2. There is a missing integer in the array.\\n\\nIf there is *no* missing integers, this means that the array has all number from 1 to n. This must mean that the array is full. Why, because in the range [1..n] there are exactly n numbers, and if you place n numbers in an array of length n, the array is by definition full. (in this case the solution is to return n+1 which is the first smallest integer).\\n\\nOnce you understand the first case above understanding the second is easy. If there *is* a missing integer (or more than one), the missing integer(s), let\\'s call it X, must be in the range 1..n. Why, because if the missing integer X is *not* in the range [1..n] that would imply that all integers [1..n] are in the array, which would mean that the array is full, leaving no space to place X (since X is not in the range [1..n]).\\n\\nThen the algorithm becomes:\\n\\n1. Ignore all numbers <=0 and >n since they are outside the range of possible answers (which we proved was [1..n]). We do this by replacing them with the value n+1.\\n1. For all other integers <n+1, mark their bucket (cell) to indicate the integer exists. (\\\\*see below)\\n1. Find the first cell not marked, that is the first missing integer. If you did not find an unmarked cell, there was no missing integer, so return n+1.\\n\\n\\\\*I recommend looking at this solution for a very smart way to mark the cells:\\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/discuss/17214/Java-simple-solution-with-documentation\\n\\n[**Note**: I find the use of the words *first missing integer* misleading.

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

If a positive integer is not in the given array it, the missing integer *must* be in the range `[1..n]`. This is the crucial observation we use to deduce the algorithm.\\n\\nSo, If an integer is missing it must be in the range `[1..n]`, if an integer is not missing then the answer is `n+1`.\\n\\nI\\'ll try my best to explain why.\\n\\nLet\\'s picture the only two possibilities:\\n\\n1. There is no missing integer in the array\\n2. There is a missing integer in the array.\\n\\nIf there is *no* missing integers, this means that the array has all number from 1 to n. This must mean that the array is full. Why, because in the range [1..n] there are exactly n numbers, and if you place n numbers in an array of length n, the array is by definition full. (in this case the solution is to return n+1 which is the first smallest integer).\\n\\nOnce you understand the first case above understanding the second is easy. If there *is* a missing integer (or more than one), the missing integer(s), let\\'s call it X, must be in the range 1..n. Why, because if the missing integer X is *not* in the range [1..n] that would imply that all integers [1..n] are in the array, which would mean that the array is full, leaving no space to place X (since X is not in the range [1..n]).\\n\\nThen the algorithm becomes:\\n\\n1. Ignore all numbers <=0 and >n since they are outside the range of possible answers (which we proved was [1..n]). We do this by replacing them with the value n+1.\\n1. For all other integers <n+1, mark their bucket (cell) to indicate the integer exists. (\\\\*see below)\\n1. Find the first cell not marked, that is the first missing integer. If you did not find an unmarked cell, there was no missing integer, so return n+1.\\n\\n\\\\*I recommend looking at this solution for a very smart way to mark the cells:\\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/discuss/17214/Java-simple-solution-with-documentation\\n\\n[**Note**: I find the use of the words *first missing integer* misleading.

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

There is no missing integer in the array\\n2. There is a missing integer in the array.\\n\\nIf there is *no* missing integers, this means that the array has all number from 1 to n. This must mean that the array is full. Why, because in the range [1..n] there are exactly n numbers, and if you place n numbers in an array of length n, the array is by definition full. (in this case the solution is to return n+1 which is the first smallest integer).\\n\\nOnce you understand the first case above understanding the second is easy. If there *is* a missing integer (or more than one), the missing integer(s), let\\'s call it X, must be in the range 1..n. Why, because if the missing integer X is *not* in the range [1..n] that would imply that all integers [1..n] are in the array, which would mean that the array is full, leaving no space to place X (since X is not in the range [1..n]).\\n\\nThen the algorithm becomes:\\n\\n1. Ignore all numbers <=0 and >n since they are outside the range of possible answers (which we proved was [1..n]). We do this by replacing them with the value n+1.\\n1.

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive.

This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

If a positive integer is not in the given array it, the missing integer *must* be in the range `[1..n]`. This is the crucial observation we use to deduce the algorithm.\\n\\nSo, If an integer is missing it must be in the range `[1..n]`, if an integer is not missing then the answer is `n+1`.\\n\\nI\\'ll try my best to explain why.\\n\\nLet\\'s picture the only two possibilities:\\n\\n1. There is no missing integer in the array\\n2. There is a missing integer in the array.\\n\\nIf there is *no* missing integers, this means that the array has all number from 1 to n. This must mean that the array is full. Why, because in the range [1..n] there are exactly n numbers, and if you place n numbers in an array of length n, the array is by definition full. (in this case the solution is to return n+1 which is the first smallest integer).\\n\\nOnce you understand the first case above understanding the second is easy. If there *is* a missing integer (or more than one), the missing integer(s), let\\'s call it X, must be in the range 1..n. Why, because if the missing integer X is *not* in the range [1..n] that would imply that all integers [1..n] are in the array, which would mean that the array is full, leaving no space to place X (since X is not in the range [1..n]).\\n\\nThen the algorithm becomes:\\n\\n1. Ignore all numbers <=0 and >n since they are outside the range of possible answers (which we proved was [1..n]). We do this by replacing them with the value n+1.\\n1. For all other integers <n+1, mark their bucket (cell) to indicate the integer exists. (\\\\*see below)\\n1. Find the first cell not marked, that is the first missing integer. If you did not find an unmarked cell, there was no missing integer, so return n+1.\\n\\n\\\\*I recommend looking at this solution for a very smart way to mark the cells:\\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/discuss/17214/Java-simple-solution-with-documentation\\n\\n[**Note**: I find the use of the words *first missing integer* misleading.

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

If a positive integer is not in the given array it, the missing integer *must* be in the range `[1..n]`. This is the crucial observation we use to deduce the algorithm.\\n\\nSo, If an integer is missing it must be in the range `[1..n]`, if an integer is not missing then the answer is `n+1`.\\n\\nI\\'ll try my best to explain why.\\n\\nLet\\'s picture the only two possibilities:\\n\\n1. There is no missing integer in the array\\n2. There is a missing integer in the array.\\n\\nIf there is *no* missing integers, this means that the array has all number from 1 to n. This must mean that the array is full. Why, because in the range [1..n] there are exactly n numbers, and if you place n numbers in an array of length n, the array is by definition full. (in this case the solution is to return n+1 which is the first smallest integer).\\n\\nOnce you understand the first case above understanding the second is easy. If there *is* a missing integer (or more than one), the missing integer(s), let\\'s call it X, must be in the range 1..n. Why, because if the missing integer X is *not* in the range [1..n] that would imply that all integers [1..n] are in the array, which would mean that the array is full, leaving no space to place X (since X is not in the range [1..n]).\\n\\nThen the algorithm becomes:\\n\\n1. Ignore all numbers <=0 and >n since they are outside the range of possible answers (which we proved was [1..n]). We do this by replacing them with the value n+1.\\n1. For all other integers <n+1, mark their bucket (cell) to indicate the integer exists. (\\\\*see below)\\n1. Find the first cell not marked, that is the first missing integer. If you did not find an unmarked cell, there was no missing integer, so return n+1.\\n\\n\\\\*I recommend looking at this solution for a very smart way to mark the cells:\\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/discuss/17214/Java-simple-solution-with-documentation\\n\\n[**Note**: I find the use of the words *first missing integer* misleading.

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

If a positive integer is not in the given array it, the missing integer *must* be in the range `[1..n]`. This is the crucial observation we use to deduce the algorithm.\\n\\nSo, If an integer is missing it must be in the range `[1..n]`, if an integer is not missing then the answer is `n+1`.\\n\\nI\\'ll try my best to explain why.\\n\\nLet\\'s picture the only two possibilities:\\n\\n1. There is no missing integer in the array\\n2. There is a missing integer in the array.\\n\\nIf there is *no* missing integers, this means that the array has all number from 1 to n. This must mean that the array is full. Why, because in the range [1..n] there are exactly n numbers, and if you place n numbers in an array of length n, the array is by definition full. (in this case the solution is to return n+1 which is the first smallest integer).\\n\\nOnce you understand the first case above understanding the second is easy. If there *is* a missing integer (or more than one), the missing integer(s), let\\'s call it X, must be in the range 1..n. Why, because if the missing integer X is *not* in the range [1..n] that would imply that all integers [1..n] are in the array, which would mean that the array is full, leaving no space to place X (since X is not in the range [1..n]).\\n\\nThen the algorithm becomes:\\n\\n1. Ignore all numbers <=0 and >n since they are outside the range of possible answers (which we proved was [1..n]). We do this by replacing them with the value n+1.\\n1. For all other integers <n+1, mark their bucket (cell) to indicate the integer exists. (\\\\*see below)\\n1. Find the first cell not marked, that is the first missing integer. If you did not find an unmarked cell, there was no missing integer, so return n+1.\\n\\n\\\\*I recommend looking at this solution for a very smart way to mark the cells:\\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/discuss/17214/Java-simple-solution-with-documentation\\n\\n[**Note**: I find the use of the words *first missing integer* misleading.

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

However, having the missing integer being 7 is impossible, since that would imply that we have from 1 to 6 all in an array of length 5.\\n\\nAs a side note, this condition is generalizable if you want to turn the problem into finding the minimum positive integer while having the positive numbers starting from an arbitrary min (instead of 1). In that case, the max cannot exceed the \"length of the array\" + min. I accidentally solved for that initially - which makes my code and comments pretty aweful.\\n\\n**2 We can ignore any number that is not a possible candidate.**\\nAny number that doesn\\'t fit into our range, we don\\'t care. It would not cause us to mistaken it as the missing number, since it is beyond the range of possible missing numbers. So 0s? negatives? numbers beyond \"length of the array\" + 1? All can be ignored, and their array slot set to some random non-positive number to indicate emptiness.\\n\\n**3 We now know exactly where to put each number.** \\nSince we ignore all numbers not in range, we know that we only have to consider exactly n numbers, where n is the length of the array. And, we know that these numbers range from 1 to n. So, if a number is 3, we put it the slot with index of 3-1 = 2. If the number is 12, we put it in slot 11, etc. Any number beyond range, we set its slot to -1.\\n\\nSo this is just a circular sort. For each number not in a their slot, just swap it with a number in their slot. Do this until the current slot is either having a number in the right place or empty. Look up cycle sort/circle sort/circular sort for more details on this part.\\n\\nThe only thing to watch out is duplicates: they tend to get you infinite loop since you will be keep trying to swap into the same position. Treatment for duplicates are simple: set current slot to empty, since the destination slot already have someone with the right index.\\n\\nOnce this is done, a simple loop to find the first slot with a -1 would give us the first missing positive. And if all slots are filled? Just return the length of the array.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\nFor Big O analysis, you will note that generalized circular sort takes O(N^2). This is due to the fact that in the general algorithm, each step to figure out the correct index takes O(N) by scanning the array. Here we know the right index instantly, so it is O(N). To derive it, think about how many steps did we perform to insert the right element into the right index: each element took exactly 1 step to be inserted to the right place or emptied."

The solution must have a time complexity of O(n) and use constant extra space.\\n\\nOne way to solve this problem is to use the index of the array to store the positive integers in their correct position. For example, if we have a number x, we should put it in the position nums[x-1]. We need to iterate the array and for each number, swap it to its correct position until the array has all positive integers in their correct position. After that, we can iterate the array again to find the first missing positive integer by checking if the number in position i is not equal to i+1.\\n\\nFor example, in the case of [3, 4, -1, 1], after swapping, the array becomes [1, -1, 3, 4], and the first missing positive integer is 2, which is the first missing number in the sequence [1, 2, 3, ...].\\n\\nIn summary, the solution involves two steps:\\n\\nSwapping the numbers in the array to their correct position.\\nFinding the first missing positive integer by checking the sequence."

For example, if we have a number x, we should put it in the position nums[x-1]. We need to iterate the array and for each number, swap it to its correct position until the array has all positive integers in their correct position.

So I can remove all elements out of range, and the array size also decreases, and so on, until i can't reduce the size anymore then i just write out the remaining array size plus one.\n\nBut this requires deduplicating the array in O(n) time and O(1) space, since the problem does not state that the arrays can't contain duplicate elements. I could do it with a hash table in O(n) but I don't know how to without extra space.\n\nI also don't think this actually shaves off an exponential amount of array size every time which would be required to make it a O(n) time solution. Bad solutions exist (like if 1 is the only missing element, resulting in only 1 element being removed at a time) that make this a O(n^2) worst case. If there's a better way, it still eludes me right now.\n\nEdit: Nvm! I figured this out. \n\nThe trick is to store a \"seen\" array INSIDE the original array by flipping a number to negative to indicate that it has been seen. This results in O(1) space complexity.\nThe \"seen\" array fits in the original array this way because of the observation that the missing element value is bounded by the size of the array."

Then after 20s, you\\'ve run 200m, your friend has run 100m. But because the track is circular, so you will be at the same place with your friend since the difference between your distances is exactly 100m.\\n\\nHow about we change another track, change the speed of you and your friend? As long as your speeds are not the same, the faster person will always catch up with the slower person again.\\n\\nThat\\'s the key point for this problem.\\n\\n## Solution\\n\\nWe just need to follow the strategy above - make a slower pointer and a faster pointer. Then we loop and loop again:\\n- if the fast pointer catch up with slow pointer, then it\\'s a circular linked list\\n- if the fast pointer get to the end, then it\\'s not a circular linked list\\n\\nHere\\'s a sample code from me:\\n\\n```js\\nconst hasCycle = (head) => {\\n  let fast = head;\\n  while (fast && fast.next) {\\n    head = head.next;\\n    fast = fast.next.next;\\n    if (head === fast) return true;\\n  }\\n  return false;\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\nUPDATE at Apr 04 2023\\n\\nSince there\\'s a question in comments said the running case is a continuous process while linked-list is discrete, so let me put more here to explain.\\n\\nLet\\'s suppose we have these:\\n- `v1` is for the speed of pointer 1\\n- `v2` is for the speed of pointer 2\\n- `s` is for the length of the linked list\\n- `t` is for the time spent before meet\\n- `n` is an integer\\n\\nSo, we are looking for `(|v1-v2|) * t = s * n`, and we can get `t = s * n / (|v1-v2|)`. Since they are all integers, so it\\'s very easy to find a `n` to make it happen, at least we could let the `n` equals to `|v1-v2|`.\\n",

What is relevant is the speed of the characters.\\n\\nOkay, now that we have that context, let\\'s talk about the approach to this problem.\\n\\nWe understand that the linked list has a cycle, anyone running through this linked list will be running around this circle forever. If it wasn\\'t, they would have stopped at the end.\\n\\nLet\\'s now imagine two types of tracks. \\n\\nOne is a straight line you see in sprint racing. If we imagine a non-circular linked list, then it would be the straight line. The fastest run reaches the end and that\\'s that.\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/tryck/image_1557470440.png)\\n\\n\\nHowever, if it was an actual track where runners would have to run laps, then it would be a circular linked list.\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/tryck/image_1557470481.png)\\n\\nNow let\\'s bring back the tortoise and the hare.\\nSince we know that the hare is faster, it will likely reach the \"end\" of the linked list faster than the tortoise. So it\\'s reasonable to say that it goes at a faster speed in relation to the tortoise\\'s speed.\\n\\nIf the track (linked list) is circular, the hare will be running around in circles and eventually so will the tortoise. At one point, the hare will have lapped the tortoise, which would mean that they\\'re in a circle since the hare will have revist a position that it\\'s already been in since the tortoise is \"behind\" it.\\n\\nIf we were to look at this mathematically, we can formulize it like this:\\n\\nSuppose that the hare runs at a rate of `ax` , where `a` is a constant and the tortoise runs at a pace of `bx` where `b` is a constant and `a > b`.\\n\\nSince they have different slopes, mathematically, they will intersect at one point. That intersection indicates a circle because the hare will revisit a position it has already been in since it comes into the same position as the tortoise.\\n\\nRuntime: `O(n)`\\nSpace Complexity: `O(1)`",

                "content": "# Interview Guide - Detecting Cycles in a Linked List: A Dual-Approach Analysis\\n\\n## Introduction & Problem Understanding\\n\\nDetecting cycles in a linked list is a classic problem that tests a developer\\'s ability to understand and manipulate data structures. In this problem, you are given the head of a singly-linked list. The objective is to determine whether the list contains a cycle. A cycle exists if a node in the list can be visited more than once by following the `next` pointers continuously.\\n\\n### Key Concepts and Constraints\\n\\n1. **Node Anatomy**:  \\n   Each node in the list contains an integer value and a `next` pointer that points to the subsequent node in the list.\\n\\n2. **Cycle Detection**:  \\n   The primary task is to identify whether a cycle exists within the list. If a cycle is detected, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.\\n\\n3. **Memory Efficiency**:  \\n   The question poses an implicit challenge: Can you solve it using $$ O(1) $$ memory, meaning constant extra space?\\n\\n## Strategies to Tackle the Problem\\n\\n1. **Hash Table Method**:  \\nThis approach involves storing visited nodes in a hash table. During traversal, if a node is encountered that already exists in the hash table, a cycle is confirmed.\\n\\n2. **Two-Pointers Method (Floyd\\'s Cycle-Finding Algorithm)**:  \\nAlso known as the \"hare and tortoise\" algorithm, this method employs two pointers that move at different speeds. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer, confirming the cycle\\'s existence.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Live Coding 2 Solution & More\\nhttps://youtu.be/ew-E3mHOBT0?si=DTvrijJplAk7XV1w\\n\\n## Solution #1: Hash Table Method\\n\\n### Intuition and Logic Behind the Solution\\n\\nThe basic idea here is to traverse the list and keep a record of the nodes we\\'ve visited so far. If at any point we encounter a node that we\\'ve already visited, we can conclude that there is a cycle in the list.\\n\\n### Step-by-step Explanation\\n\\n1. **Initialization**: \\n    - Create an empty set, `visited_nodes`, to keep track of the nodes that have been visited.\\n\\n2. **Traversal and Verification**:  \\n    - Traverse the list starting from the head node.\\n    - At each node, check whether it already exists in `visited_nodes`.\\n    - If it does, return `True` as a cycle is detected.\\n    - Otherwise, add the node to `visited_nodes`.\\n\\n### Complexity Analysis\\n\\n- **Time Complexity**: $$ O(n) $$ \\u2014 Each node is visited once.\\n- **Space Complexity**: $$ O(n) $$ \\u2014 To store visited nodes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Solution #2: Two-Pointer Method (Floyd\\'s Cycle-Finding Algorithm)\\n\\n### Intuition and Logic Behind the Solution\\n\\nAlso known as the \"hare and tortoise\" algorithm, this method uses two pointers that traverse the list at different speeds. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.\\n\\n### Step-by-step Explanation\\n\\n1. **Initialization**:  \\n   - Initialize two pointers, `slow_pointer` and `fast_pointer`, both pointing to the head node initially.\\n\\n2. **Cycle Detection**:  \\n   - Traverse the list until the `fast_pointer` or its `next` becomes `None`.\\n   - Update `slow_pointer` and `fast_pointer` as follows:\\n        - `slow_pointer = slow_pointer.next`\\n        - `fast_pointer = fast_pointer.next.next`\\n   - If `slow_pointer` and `fast_pointer` meet at some point, return

compelling strategies for detecting cycles in linked lists.\\n\\n1. **Hash Table Method**:  \\n   Intuitive and adaptable, though potentially memory-intensive.\\n   \\n2. **Two-Pointers Method**:  \\n   A marvel of memory efficiency, but perhaps less straightforward to the uninitiated.\\n\\nNavigating this problem is a dive into data structure nuances and algorithmic elegance. Whether you appreciate the directness of the Hash Table or the finesse of Two-Pointers, each method champions a facet of computational acumen. This isn\\'t just a problem; it\\'s a step in honing algorithmic artistry. Embrace the challenge! \\uD83D\\uDE80\\uD83C\\uDF1F",

                "content": "I want to explain why we can get the answer when using `fast-slow` method. Share my opinion below.\\n\\nFast-Slow Solution:\\n-------------------\\n\\n    public class Solution { //java version\\n        public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {\\n            ListNode fast = head;\\n            ListNode slow = head;\\n            while(fast != null && fast.next != null){            \\n                fast = fast.next.next; //2 times\\n                slow = slow.next;\\n                if(fast == slow) return true;\\n            }\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\nFirst,\\n------\\n\\nwe assume that they can meet. Set the `linear length` as `a`, the `cycle length` as `c`, the slow's running distance from cycle's start point to meeting point as `b`. `a and c are known, b is unknown.` We want a equation to describe `b` by using `a` and `c`.\\n\\nHere is the diagram:  \\n\\n                   b..3    \\n                   .   \\\\     \\n                   c   2   \\n                   \\\\  /     \\n    1-2-3-4-5-...-a -1  \\n\\nAn important point is that, `the running part of linear length` is not `a`, actually it's `a-1`.** That's because they use head as start point: \\n\\n        ListNode fast = head;\\n        ListNode slow = head;\\nthen begin to run:\\n\\n            fast = fast.next.next;\\n            slow = slow.next;\\nThe `head` point `can't be included` when calculating this relation: \\n\\n    slow total running length * 2 = fast total running length\\n\\nIf fast's speed is `twice` of slow's speed, we can get:\\n\\n    slow total running length = (a-1)+b //not a!!!\\n    \\n    fast total running length = 2*((a-1)+b) //2 can be t times\\n\\nBecause they meet at point `b`, we can get equation:\\n\\n    (fast total running length - running part of linear length) % c = b\\n\\nwhich is:\\n\\n    (2*((a-1)+b) - (a-1))%c = b\\n    2*((a-1)+b) - (a-1) = n*c +b\\n    (a-1)+b = n*c\\n    b = n*c-a+1\\n\\nThen,\\n-----\\n\\nif fast and slow can meet, we can get a integer `b` when `n` is increasing where `n` is an integer starting from `0`. Actually, the `b` is the first integer that is bigger than 0:\\n\\n    b = n*c-a+1 //write it on paper, compare b with code's result\\n\\nGenerally,\\n----------\\n\\nif fast's speed is `t times` of slow's speed, we get:\\n\\n    (fast total running length - running part of linear length) % c = b\\n    (t*((a-1)+b) - (a-1))%c = b\\nMost general equation:\\n\\n    b = n/(t-1) * c - a + 1 //1.fast&slow start from head, 2.t times, 3.a&c are known, 4.n from 0\\n                            //5.if b>c, b=b%c\\n\\n**(If we want to use `a` as the running part of linear length, we need a `dummy head`.)\\n\\nIf there is anything wrong, please figure it out.

                "content": "The simplest way to solve this problem is to keep a list, ```seen```, which will keep track of all the nodes we have already visited. If we ever encounter a node which we have already seen, that means that we must have a cycle! \\n\\n**Method 1: Using List; Time: O(N^2), Memory: O(N)**\\n```\\ndef hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:\\n\\tseen = [] #list of nodes we have already seen\\n\\twhile head: \\n\\t\\tif head in seen: #if we already saw this node then there is a cycle\\n\\t\\t\\treturn True\\n\\t\\tseen.append(head) #add node to our list of seen nodes\\n\\t\\thead = head.next \\n\\treturn False #we reached the end of the list -- no cycle!\\n```\\n\\nThis method is accepted by LeetCode but is very slow due to the ```O(N)``` time it takes to check ```if head in seen```. We can make a quick optimization to this method by using ```set``` instead of ```list```, since ```set``` (an unordered data structure in python which doesn\\'t allow for duplicates) uses a hashing function for ```O(1)``` lookups (like a dictionary). This reduces the overall time complexity to ```O(N)```!\\n\\n**Method 2: Using Set; Time: O(N), Memory: O(N)**\\n```\\ndef hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:\\n\\tseen = set() #set of nodes we have already seen\\n\\twhile head:\\n\\t\\tif head in seen: #if we already saw this node then there is a cycle\\n\\t\\t\\treturn True\\n\\t\\tseen.add(head) #add node to our list of seen nodes\\n\\t\\thead = head.next #visit next node\\n\\treturn False #we reached the end of the list -- no cycle!\\n```\\n\\nEven though this is a good solution, you can often solve linked list problems without extra data structures like ```set``` and ```list```. Often, the way to do this is with recursion or two-pointers. For this problem, recursion doesn\\'t offer much help since we would struggle to break the problem up into smaller sub-problems. However, two pointers can be super helpful! We can use a ```slow``` pointer and a ```fast``` pointer to travel through the linked list at different speeds and if they are ever the same node then we know there must be a cycle! Otherwise, the ```fast``` pointer will simply reach the end of the list.\\n\\n**Method 3: Two-pointers; Time: O(N), Memory: O(1)**\\n```\\ndef hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:\\n\\tslow = fast = head #slow and fast pointers\\n\\twhile fast and fast.next: #while not at the end of the list\\n\\t\\tslow = slow.next #slow moves forward by 1\\n\\t\\tfast = fast.next.next #fast moves forward by 2\\n\\t\\tif slow == fast: #if they are the same then we must have a cycle!\\n\\t\\t\\treturn True\\n\\treturn False #no cycle found\\n```\\n\\n**Thanks for Reading!**\\nIf this post has been helpful, please consider upvoting!

To do so, we use the Floyd\\'s Cycle detection algorithm, which is also known as the \"Tortoise and Hare\" algorithm.\\n\\n# Approach:\\nWe use two pointers, rabbit and tortoise, which start from the head of the linked list. The rabbit moves twice as fast as the tortoise, i.e., it moves two nodes at a time while the tortoise moves one node at a time.\\n\\nIf there is no cycle in the linked list, the rabbit will reach the end of the list, i.e., it will become NULL, and we can return false. However, if there is a cycle, the rabbit will eventually catch up with the tortoise, and both pointers will point to the same node. We return true in this case.\\n\\n## Algorithm Steps:\\n\\n1. Initialize two pointers, rabbit and tortoise, to the head of the linked list.\\n2. While the rabbit pointer is not NULL and its next pointer is not NULL, repeat steps 3-4.\\n3. Move the rabbit pointer two nodes ahead.\\n4. Move the tortoise pointer one node ahead.\\n5. If the rabbit and tortoise pointers point to the same node, return true.\\n6. If the rabbit pointer becomes NULL, return false.\\n# Complexity:\\n- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

                "content": "# Intuition\\nThe main idea to solve the question of detecting a cycle in a singly-linked list is to use the concept of two pointers: a \"slow\" pointer that moves one step at a time and a \"fast\" pointer that moves two steps at a time. By having these two pointers traverse the list simultaneously, if there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Solution Video\\n\\n### Please subscribe to my channel from here.

Other might be different a bit.\\n\\n1. Initialize `fast` and `slow` pointers to the head of the linked list.\\n   - `fast` and `slow` are initially pointing to the head of the linked list, which is the starting point.\\n\\n2. Enter a loop while both `fast` and `fast.next` are not null.\\n   - This loop will continue until either `fast` or `fast.next` becomes null, indicating the end of the linked list or if there is no cycle.\\n\\n3. Move the `fast` pointer two steps ahead (`fast = fast.next.next`) and the `slow` pointer one step ahead (`slow = slow.next`).\\n   - This step simulates the two-pointer traversal where `fast` moves twice as fast as `slow`.\\n\\n4. Check if `fast` is equal to `slow`.\\n   - If `fast` and `slow` pointers meet at the same node, it means there is a cycle in the linked list, and we return `True`.\\n\\n5. If the loop exits without finding a cycle, return `False`.\\n   - If the loop completes without finding a cycle, it means that the `fast` pointer has reached the end of the list, and there is no cycle. In this case, we return `False`.\\n\\nThis algorithm uses two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, to traverse the linked list. The `fast` pointer moves twice as fast as the `slow` pointer. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer. If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the list, and the function will return `False`. This algorithm is an efficient way to detect cycles in a singly-linked list.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n)\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1)\\n\\n```python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:\\n    \\n        fast = head\\n        slow = head\\n        \\n        while fast and fast.next:\\n            fast = fast.next.next\\n            slow = slow.next\\n            \\n            if fast == slow:\\n                return True\\n    \\n        return False\\n```\\n```javascript []\\nvar hasCycle = function(head) {\\n    let fast = head;\\n    let slow = head;\\n\\n    while (fast && fast.next) {\\n        fast = fast.next.next;\\n        slow = slow.next;\\n\\n        if (fast === slow) {\\n            return true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    return false;    \\n};\\n```\\n```java []\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {\\n        ListNode fast = head;\\n        ListNode slow = head;\\n\\n        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {\\n            fast = fast.next.next;\\n            slow = slow.next;\\n\\n            if (fast == slow) {\\n                return true;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return false;        \\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {\\n        ListNode* fast = head;\\n        ListNode* slow = head;\\n\\n        while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {\\n            fast = fast->next->next;\\n            slow = slow->next;\\n\\n            if (fast == slow) {\\n                return true;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return false;        \\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n",

See, since our fast pointer taking two steps at a time,so by defaullt he will be always ahead of our slow pointer.\\n* But their is a cycle present in the linked list, our fast pointer end up in moving the cycle only.\\n* And their is a time came when both our fast and slow pointer stands up the same position.\\n* So, If fast and slow pointer cames to same position then we will return true by saying that yes their is a cycle in the linked list.\\n* But, Suppose if their is no cycle present in the linked list, then? \\n* If their is no cyle present in the linked list then our fast pointer was the first one who reaches to the end.\\n* So if fast pointer reaches to the end, then we will say their is no cycle present in the linked list and hence return false.\\n* See below Image for better clarification.\\n_________________\\n* ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/11e14acb-6005-4c2a-8ed5-59908440490a_1646713764.0097659.jpeg)\\n_________\\n**Code (C++)**\\n```\\n/**\\n * Definition for singly-linked list.\\n * struct ListNode {\\n *     int val;\\n *     ListNode *next;\\n *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}\\n * };\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {\\n        ListNode* slow = head; // making slow pointer\\n        ListNode* fast = head; // making fast pointer\\n\\n        while(fast != NULL && fast -> next != NULL)\\n        {\\n            slow = slow -> next; // move slow one step at a time\\n            fast = fast -> next -> next; // move fast two step at a time\\n            \\n            // if at any point slow and fast pointer reaches to the same pos\\n            // then we can say that yess!, their is a cycle and hence return true\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n            if(slow == fast) // if slow is equal to fast\\n            {\\n                return true; // means cycle, and hence return true\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        // otherwise no cycle is present, hence return false\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n***`If u find this useful , please consider to give a upvote!!`***",

He uses a try catch method which would not work in cpp and will cause an infinite loop. \n\nWe will use the same [Tortoise and Hare](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Tortoise_and_hare) approach where two pointers are mainted.\n1) Slow pointer //Moves only 1 step at a time\n2) Fast Pointer //Moves 2 steps at a time\n\nAs soon as these pointers meet, we are sure that there is a LOOP(return true). The stop condition for our loop  will be that if either of these pointers reach NULL - that means that the linked list has a definite end. Hence, we will break the loop and say that there is NO LOOP(return false).\n\nTo Understand how it works : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUm2ABqAs1w\n\n```\nbool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {\n        ListNode *slow=head,*fast=head;\n        \n        while(slow!=NULL && fast!=NULL && fast->next!=NULL) {\n            \n            slow = slow->next;               //Slow moves by 1 step\n            fast = fast->next->next;        //Fast moves by two steps\n            \n            if(slow==fast) //If they meet then there is a loop\n                return true;\n        }\n        \n        return false; //No loop\n    }\n```\nFollow Up: [Linked List Cyle 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/description/) asks us to find  the point where the cycle is starting.

                "content": "The Algorithm is used to check if there are any loops in the linked list. It is really simple algorithm in which you take two pointers each pointing to the head node. One is a Fast node which jumps 2 nodes in single loop and the other one is Slow pointer which jumps 1 node at a time. If both of the pointers meet again at a point in the linked list then there is a loop exist and hence return true.\\n\\n***Bonus tip:- If there is no loop in the Linked List then this method can be used to find the middle of the Linked list without knowing the length of the linked list. You just run this same technique until and unless the fast pointer reaches null, and the slow pointer will be pointing to the middle element of the linked list.***\\n\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {\\n        if(head == null){\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        \\n        ListNode fast = head;\\n        ListNode slow = head;\\n        boolean t = true;\\n        \\n        do{\\n            if(fast == null || fast.next == null){\\n                t = false;\\n                break;\\n            }\\n            fast = fast.next.next;\\n            slow = slow.next;\\n        }while(fast!=slow);\\n        return t;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n***Please do upvote if this helped.***",

To accomplish this, we can use two pointers, a slow pointer, and a fast pointer. The slow pointer moves one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If the linked list has a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up with the slow pointer, and they will both point to the same node.\\n# Approach\\nThe approach to solving this problem is to use the two pointers, slow and fast, to traverse the linked list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, and the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If the linked list has a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up with the slow pointer, and they will both point to the same node.\\n\\nTo check if the linked list has a cycle, we first check if the head of the linked list is None or if the next node is None. If either of these conditions is True, then the linked list has no cycle, and we return False.\\n\\nNext, we initialize the slow pointer to the head of the linked list, and the fast pointer to the next node. We then enter a while loop that continues as long as the fast pointer is not None and the next node of the fast pointer is not None.\\n\\nIn the while loop, we check if the slow pointer is equal to the fast pointer. If this is True, then we have found a cycle in the linked list, and we return True.\\n\\nIf the slow pointer is not equal to the fast pointer, we move the slow pointer one step at a time and the fast pointer two steps at a time. We repeat this process until either the fast pointer is None or the next node of the fast pointer is None.\\n\\nIf the while loop terminates, then the linked list has no cycle, and we return False.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:$$O(n)$$\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:$$O(1)$$\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n# Definition for singly-linked list.\\n# class ListNode:\\n#     def __init__(self, x):\\n#         self.val = x\\n#         self.next = None\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:\\n        if not head or not head.next:\\n            return False\\n        slow=head\\n        fast=head.next\\n        while(fast and fast.next):\\n            if slow==fast:\\n                return True\\n            slow=slow.next\\n            fast=fast.next.next\\n        return False\\n```\\n### Please upvote!",

                "content": "# 141. Linked List Cycle\\nI originally approached this problem simply seeking a solution. After getting a solution I read the little follow up at the bottom (can you do it in O(1) space) and it immediately clicked for me. This post will still go through the same logic and thought process. We will just take the extra step to get to the optimized solution.\\n\\n## Initial Thoughts\\n* If we travel through the linked list and encounter a value twice there is a cycle\\n* If we store all of the nodes in an array of seen nodes we increase both runtime and space complexity\\n* Instead of storing values we can use flag values to denote encountered nodes (note on this below)\\n* An apporpriate flag value would be 10<sup>6</sup> since it is out of the defined Node.val bounds (-10<sup>5</sup> < Node.val < 10<sup>5</sup>)\\n\\n## Approach\\n\\nThis problem breaks down on the smallest level to a decision structure. Has the current node been seen or not? If it has been seen then we have a cycle and return True. Otherwise, flag the node and move on.\\nThat is the hard part really. As long as our current node has a value we execute this decision structure and move on. Rinse, lather, repeat.\\n\\nWe start with while head != None. This does a few things for us.\\n\\n1. If we reach a node that has a value of None, the previous node was the last node. This means we traversed a linear (non-cyclic) linked list. Success!\\n2. Handles the edge case of null input\\n\\nOnce we have our loop set each time we havent seen a node we flag it and move on. If we encounter a flagged node the stop everything and return True. Successfully traversing the liked list and reaching the end guarantees that our input had no cycle.\\n\\n#### Note on bullet point 3\\nIf you thought about the fact that the data is being altered, I did too. What if we need this data to use somewhere else? The way I figured this could be done is assume the data value constraints and choose a addition/subtraction factor. In this case if we encounter a positive value add 10<sup>6</sup> and if it is negative subtract 10<sup>6</sup>. Then the flags are now ranges of numbers. For example: `if num in range(-10e5, 10e5 + 1)` could replace `if head.val == 10e6`. Then at the end we could call a \"fix\" function that would go through an fix all the flags.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:\\n        \\n        # We want to visit each node and mark it as visited\\n        # We can use a simple boolean value or a value outside of our Node.val range \\n        # (ex. -10e6 or 10e6 would be fine)\\n        while head != None:\\n            \\n            # We will use the flag value of 10e6. If Node.val == 10e6 we\\'ve encountered a cycle\\n            # else change the node\\'s value to 10e6 and move to the next node\\n            if head.val == 10e6:\\n                return True\\n            else:\\n                head.val = 10e6\\n                head = head.next\\n                \\n        # Breaking out of the while loop indicates we have no cycles\\n        # This would mean we encountered a node with Node.next = None\\n        return False\\n```",

If you like this solution or find it useful,* ***please upvote*** *this post.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n***Idea:***\\n\\nOne brute force solution here would be to map every single pointer in the list until we either reach the end of the list or find a duplicate, but that would use **O(n) space**.\\n\\nThe other brute force solution would involve counting nodes until we reached the designated constraint (**10e4**). If we pass that amount before reaching the end of the linked list, it must be a cycle. This solution is **O(1) space**, but much slower than an optimal solution.\\n\\nBut this problem is also an entry into the common question of **cycle detection**. One of the easiest methods of cycle detection is **Floyd\\'s Tortoise and the Hare algorithm**, which states that if you define two branches (**slow** and **fast**), and have the slow branch perform a given function once per iteration and the fast branch perform the same function twice per iteration, that they will eventually meet at the same point if the function is cyclical.\\n\\nIn essence, we start the hare just ahead of the tortoise, let them go, and see if the hare cycles back around to catch up with the tortoise again.\\n\\nOtherwise, if we ever reach the end of the linked list, we know that there can be no cycle.\\n\\n---\\n\\n***Implementation:***\\n\\nFor the javascript solution, we can also use **optional chaining** to good effect here to make the code slightly more readable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Javascript Code:**\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **80ms / 41.1MB** (beats 96%).\\n```javascript\\nvar hasCycle = function(head) {\\n    let slow = head, fast = head?.next\\n    while (slow && fast)\\n        if (slow === fast) return true\\n        else slow = slow.next, fast = fast.next?.next\\n    return false\\n};\\n```",

The most common way to solve this problem is by using the Tortoise and Hare algorithm.\\n\\nThe idea is that we create two pointers,  a slow one and a fast one.  The slow pointer traverses the linked list 1 node at a time, while the fast pointer traverses the linked list 2 nodes at a time.  If at some point the two pointers meet on the same node, then that means a cycle exists.\\n\\nWhy does this work? For a visual animation, please see the video, but for a simple explanation, think of two people running on a circular track.  If both people run and one of them runs faster than the other, then the faster person will eventually catch up to the slower one and \"lap\" them.  In other words, they will be back at the same position again.

Here\\'s an explanation of the code:\\n\\nThe input is a linked list represented by the head node.\\n\\nThe function `hasCycle` takes in the head node as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the linked list contains a cycle or not.\\n\\nWe initialize two pointers, `s` (slow) and `f` (fast), both pointing to the head node.\\n\\nWe then start iterating over the linked list using `s` and `f` pointers. The `s` pointer moves one step at a time while the `f` pointer moves two steps at a time.\\n\\nIf there is a cycle in the linked list, the `f` pointer will eventually catch up to the `s` pointer from behind, i.e., `f` will eventually become equal to `s`.\\n\\nAt this point, we can return `True` as there is a cycle in the linked list.\\n\\nIf `f` reaches the end of the linked list, i.e., `f` becomes `None`, it means that there is no cycle in the linked list. We can return `False` in this case.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(N)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(1)\\n\\n\\nThe `time complexity` of this algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. The `space complexity` is `O(1)` since we are only using two pointers, regardless of the size of the linked list.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n# Definition for singly-linked list.\\n# class ListNode:\\n#     def __init__(self, x):\\n#         self.val = x\\n#         self.next = None\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:\\n        s, f = head,head\\n        while f and f.next: \\n            s = s.next\\n            f = f.next.next\\n            if f == s: return True\\n        return False\\n        \\n```",

The slow pointer moves one node at a time, while the fast pointer moves two nodes at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer, and they will meet at some node in the cycle.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nHere\\'s the algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, to the head of the linked list.\\n2. Traverse the linked list using the slow and fast pointers as follows:\\na. Move the slow pointer one node at a time.\\nb. Move the fast pointer two nodes at a time.\\nc. If the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list (i.e., its next node is null), then the linked list has no cycle, so return false.\\nd. If the fast pointer ever equals the slow pointer, then there is a cycle in the linked list, so return true.\\n3. If we have reached the end of the linked list (i.e., the fast pointer is null), then the linked list has no cycle, so return false.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: The algorithm traverses the linked list once using two pointers. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, and the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. The maximum number of steps that the fast pointer can take is N/2, where N is the length of the linked list. Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(N).\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:  The algorithm only uses two pointers, so the space complexity is O(1) (constant space).\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nnote : This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses two pointers to traverse the linked list.\\n# Code\\n```\\n# Definition for singly-linked list.\\n# class ListNode:\\n#     def __init__(self, x):\\n#         self.val = x\\n#         self.next = None\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:\\n        # Initialize two pointers to the head of the linked list\\n        slow = head\\n        fast = head\\n    \\n        # Traverse the linked list using the slow and fast pointers\\n        while fast and fast.next:\\n        # Move the slow pointer one node at a time\\n            slow = slow.next\\n        \\n        # Move the fast pointer two nodes at a time\\n            fast = fast.next.next\\n        \\n        # If the fast pointer ever equals the slow pointer, then there is a cycle\\n            if slow == fast:\\n                return True\\n    \\n        # If we have reached the end of the linked list, then there is no cycle\\n        return False\\n\\n\\n\\n```",

Using **Floyd\\'s Cycle Finding Algorithm**-\\nFloyd\\u2019s cycle-finding algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, moving through the sequence at different speeds. It states the usage of Linked List in this algorithm and its output.\\nThe purpose is to determine whether the linked list has a cycle or not. First, we keep two pointers of the head node they are, **slow pointer** and **fast pointer**. At each iteration, you move one of the pointers by two steps and the other one by one step. So you have two pointers tortoise and the hare. Eventually one of the two cases will happen:\\n\\n- **fastPointer** will reach the tail of the linked list(null), which means that there is no cycle in it\\n- **fastPointer** will meet **slowPointer**, which means that there is a cycle.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s understand by the below example-\\nHere the **Car M** is **SlowPointer** and **Car B** is **FastPointer**.\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/d5d5ace4-2acd-49e9-8426-ae1deefb2cd0_1648740035.1112502.png)\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/922c80fe-b2bd-4969-8323-8a063267e39d_1648740045.818089.png)\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/4debbcc6-2098-4853-ad03-15338b2828b1_1648740053.1831126.png)\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b7bc0632-72da-4123-b3ee-7a4187ba3ef2_1648740059.1595976.png)\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b00d602e-ac6e-494f-a93a-de820f9ca028_1648740064.7201557.png)\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/f870c926-189b-4f31-bc6b-770f4dfb27f1_1648740071.0575871.png)\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/3601f3f4-0a21-4db9-abad-7f094ce79e69_1648740077.4067209.png)\\n\\n```\\npublic boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {\\n        ListNode slowPointer = head;\\n        ListNode fastPointer = head;\\n        \\n        do {\\n            if (slowPointer == null || fastPointer == null || fastPointer.next == null) {\\n                return false;\\n            } \\n            slowPointer = slowPointer.next;\\n            fastPointer = fastPointer.next.next;\\n        } while (slowPointer != fastPointer);\\n        \\n        return true;\\n    }\\n```\\n**Time Complexity- O(N) \\nSpace Complexity- O(1)**\\n\\n\\n2.

                "content": "Key problem is that there is a linked list which may loop back on itself, forming a cycle.\\nWhen walking the list the cycle can be detected by noticing that the tail node points to a node that has already been seen.\\n\\nMy initial approach was to use a set to maintain a set of nodes previously traversed. Then if I came across a node already in the set I had a cycle. This ran in 3ms.\\n\\nA better approach was to use [Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd\\'s_tortoise_and_hare). This ran in 0ms.\\n\\nBoth algorithms are outlined below:\\n\\n**Set Based Algorithm**\\nThis maintains a set of previously visited nodes. If a pointer to a null node is reached then the algorithm terminates, otherwise it checks the current node against the set and if it already exists then a cycle has been found.\\n\\n**Time Complexity O(N)** as adding/checking entries in the set is O(1) and we run until we find the cycle or reach the end.\\n**Space Complexity O(N)** because we maintain a set of all the previously seen nodes and we will not detect a cycle until we have seen all nodes and added them to the set.\\n\\n**Algorithm**\\n* While node != null\\n\\t* if set contains node then found a cycle\\n\\t\\t* return false\\n\\t* Add node to set\\n\\t* Set node to successor node\\n* return false as found a null\\n\\nNote the code below could be improved by noting that the add operation returns false if the iterm is already in the set, reducing the number of calls in the loop to the set by half.

We maintain two pointers, a slow pointer and a fast pointer. The slow pointer moves one node at a time while the fast pointer moves two nodes at a time. Eventually both pointers will be going around the cycle. Because of this we can imagine that the fast pointer is behind the slow pointer and  closes in on it one node at a time. This means that the fast pointer will always catch up with the slow pointer. For example if the fast pointer is 3 nodes behind the slow pointer (remember that this is a cycle so in one sense the fast pointer is always behind the slow pointer), then the slow pointer moves one node to open the gap to four nodes, but the fast pointer moves two nodes to reduce the gap to two node, thus closing the gap by one node. So for a loop of K nodes the fast pointer will always reach the slow pointer in at most K steps of the slow pointer.\\n\\nThis algorithm ran in 0ms.\\n\\n**Time Complexity O(N)** because slow pointer takes N-K steps to reach K sized cycle and once in the cycle in worst case fast pointer will reach it in K steps. So total complexity is O(3N) as we do two fast pointer operations for every slow pointer operation.\\n\\n**Space Complexity O(1)** as no extra storage required beyond fast and slow pointers.\\n\\n**Algorithm**\\n* If head or head.next is null reach end without cycle\\n\\t* return false\\n* Initialise slow pointer to head and fast pointer to successor to head\\n* While fast ! = slow\\n\\t* Check if either of next two nodes for fast are null, if so then no cycles\\n\\t\\t* return false\\n\\t* Move slow to next node\\n\\t* Move fast two nodes ahead\\n* return true as fast and slow are pointing to same node so muct be a cycle\\n```\\npublic boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {\\n\\tif (head == null || head.next == null)\\n\\t\\treturn false;\\n\\tListNode slow = head;\\n\\tListNode fast = head.next;\\n\\twhile (slow != fast) {\\n\\t\\tif (fast.next == null || fast.next.next == null)\\n\\t\\t\\treturn false;\\n\\t\\tslow = slow.next;\\n\\t\\tfast = fast.next.next;\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn true;\\n}\\n```",

This is often used in cyclic arrays or sequences where you want to detect cycles or perform some other operation. The idea is that the fast pointer advances faster than the slow pointer, and they might eventually meet or cross paths if there\\'s a cycle. This version is commonly used in algorithms like Floyd\\'s cycle detection algorithm for finding cycles in linked lists or arrays.\\nExample use cases:\\n\\nDetecting cycles in an array or linked list.\\nFinding the duplicate element in an array (Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare algorithm).\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <vector>\\n\\nbool hasCycle(const std::vector<int>& nums) {\\n    int slow = 0, fast = 0;\\n    while (true) {\\n        slow = nums[slow];\\n        fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n        if (slow == fast) {\\n            return true; // Cycle detected\\n        }\\n        if (slow < 0 || fast < 0 || fast >= nums.size()) {\\n            return false; // No cycle\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 2}; // Example cyclic array\\n    bool hasCycleResult = hasCycle(nums);\\n    std::cout << \"Has cycle: \" << (hasCycleResult ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2. Version with Linked List:\\nIn the second version, the slow and fast pointers are used in the context of a singly linked list. The fast pointer advances by two steps while the slow pointer advances by one step. This approach is often used for operations that require traversing or processing a linked list in a certain way.\\n\\nExample use cases:\\n\\nDetecting a loop in a linked list (similar to Floyd\\'s cycle detection in arrays).\\nFinding the middle element of a linked list.\\nChecking for palindromes in a linked list.\\nMerging two sorted linked lists.\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n\\nstruct ListNode {\\n    int val;\\n    ListNode* next;\\n    ListNode(int val) : val(val), next(nullptr) {}\\n};\\n\\nbool hasCycle(ListNode* head) {\\n    if (!head || !head->next) {\\n        return false; // No cycle with 0 or 1 nodes\\n    }\\n    ListNode* slow = head->next;\\n    ListNode* fast = head->next->next;\\n    while (slow != fast) {\\n        if (!fast || !fast->next) {\\n            return false; // No cycle\\n        }\\n        slow = slow->next;\\n        fast = fast->next->next;\\n    }\\n    return true; // Cycle detected\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    // Example linked list with a cycle\\n    ListNode* head = new ListNode(3);\\n    head->next = new ListNode(2);\\n    head->next->next = new ListNode(0);\\n    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(-4);\\n    head->next->next->next->next = head->next; // Creating a cycle\\n\\n    bool hasCycleResult = hasCycle(head);\\n    std::cout << \"Has cycle: \" << (hasCycleResult ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\\n\\n    // Clean up memory (not shown in the example)\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen to use each version:\\n\\nVersion with Array (nums):\\nUse this version when you\\'re dealing with cyclic arrays or sequences, and you need to detect cycles or perform operations related to cycles.\\nVersion with Linked List:\\nUse this version when you\\'re working with linked lists and need to traverse, manipulate, or perform specific operations like detecting loops, finding middle elements, or merging lists."

This is often used in cyclic arrays or sequences where you want to detect cycles or perform some other operation. The idea is that the fast pointer advances faster than the slow pointer, and they might eventually meet or cross paths if there\\'s a cycle. This version is commonly used in algorithms like Floyd\\'s cycle detection algorithm for finding cycles in linked lists or arrays.\\nExample use cases:\\n\\nDetecting cycles in an array or linked list.\\nFinding the duplicate element in an array (Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare algorithm).\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <vector>\\n\\nbool hasCycle(const std::vector<int>& nums) {\\n    int slow = 0, fast = 0;\\n    while (true) {\\n        slow = nums[slow];\\n        fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n        if (slow == fast) {\\n            return true; // Cycle detected\\n        }\\n        if (slow < 0 || fast < 0 || fast >= nums.size()) {\\n            return false; // No cycle\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 2}; // Example cyclic array\\n    bool hasCycleResult = hasCycle(nums);\\n    std::cout << \"Has cycle: \" << (hasCycleResult ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2. Version with Linked List:\\nIn the second version, the slow and fast pointers are used in the context of a singly linked list. The fast pointer advances by two steps while the slow pointer advances by one step. This approach is often used for operations that require traversing or processing a linked list in a certain way.\\n\\nExample use cases:\\n\\nDetecting a loop in a linked list (similar to Floyd\\'s cycle detection in arrays).\\nFinding the middle element of a linked list.\\nChecking for palindromes in a linked list.\\nMerging two sorted linked lists.\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n\\nstruct ListNode {\\n    int val;\\n    ListNode* next;\\n    ListNode(int val) : val(val), next(nullptr) {}\\n};\\n\\nbool hasCycle(ListNode* head) {\\n    if (!head || !head->next) {\\n        return false; // No cycle with 0 or 1 nodes\\n    }\\n    ListNode* slow = head->next;\\n    ListNode* fast = head->next->next;\\n    while (slow != fast) {\\n        if (!fast || !fast->next) {\\n            return false; // No cycle\\n        }\\n        slow = slow->next;\\n        fast = fast->next->next;\\n    }\\n    return true; // Cycle detected\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    // Example linked list with a cycle\\n    ListNode* head = new ListNode(3);\\n    head->next = new ListNode(2);\\n    head->next->next = new ListNode(0);\\n    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(-4);\\n    head->next->next->next->next = head->next; // Creating a cycle\\n\\n    bool hasCycleResult = hasCycle(head);\\n    std::cout << \"Has cycle: \" << (hasCycleResult ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\\n\\n    // Clean up memory (not shown in the example)\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen to use each version:\\n\\nVersion with Array (nums):\\nUse this version when you\\'re dealing with cyclic arrays or sequences, and you need to detect cycles or perform operations related to cycles.\\nVersion with Linked List:\\nUse this version when you\\'re working with linked lists and need to traverse, manipulate, or perform specific operations like detecting loops, finding middle elements, or merging lists."

If the second node is part of the cycle and the second node points to the third node (by definition), the third node is also part of the cycle. You cannot have the situation that the second and 4th node are part of the cycle but the third node is not.\\n\\nAnd then, you can use the logic of the walker and runner variable.\\n\\nOnce, the runner is in the cycle, we will just run around it again and again. Yes, it skips one node every time, but this doesn\\'t matter yet. Assuming, the runner is already in the cycle going in circles, the walker will eventually reach that cycle, too (if it exists).\\n\\nNow, we have the following situation: The runner moves to steps a time, the walker moves one step a time. Lets say, the gap between the runner is of length n. Every time the walker moves one step and the runner moves two steps, this length between the two gets reduced by exactly one. As this gap gets smaller by exactly one per iteration, you will not jump over the walker with the runner by doing two steps at a time while the walker does one.\\n\\nBy that, you will eventually get the situation, that the runner is equal to the walker (if there exists a circle). \\n\\nTo be honest, in the beginning, it was confusing for me, too, that the runner wont skip over the walker. But this argument of the gap getting smaller only by one per iteration answered, why we can\\'t skip over the walker with the runner without having the equality first."

This is often used in cyclic arrays or sequences where you want to detect cycles or perform some other operation. The idea is that the fast pointer advances faster than the slow pointer, and they might eventually meet or cross paths if there\\'s a cycle. This version is commonly used in algorithms like Floyd\\'s cycle detection algorithm for finding cycles in linked lists or arrays.\\nExample use cases:\\n\\nDetecting cycles in an array or linked list.\\nFinding the duplicate element in an array (Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare algorithm).\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <vector>\\n\\nbool hasCycle(const std::vector<int>& nums) {\\n    int slow = 0, fast = 0;\\n    while (true) {\\n        slow = nums[slow];\\n        fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n        if (slow == fast) {\\n            return true; // Cycle detected\\n        }\\n        if (slow < 0 || fast < 0 || fast >= nums.size()) {\\n            return false; // No cycle\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 2}; // Example cyclic array\\n    bool hasCycleResult = hasCycle(nums);\\n    std::cout << \"Has cycle: \" << (hasCycleResult ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2. Version with Linked List:\\nIn the second version, the slow and fast pointers are used in the context of a singly linked list. The fast pointer advances by two steps while the slow pointer advances by one step. This approach is often used for operations that require traversing or processing a linked list in a certain way.\\n\\nExample use cases:\\n\\nDetecting a loop in a linked list (similar to Floyd\\'s cycle detection in arrays).\\nFinding the middle element of a linked list.\\nChecking for palindromes in a linked list.\\nMerging two sorted linked lists.\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n\\nstruct ListNode {\\n    int val;\\n    ListNode* next;\\n    ListNode(int val) : val(val), next(nullptr) {}\\n};\\n\\nbool hasCycle(ListNode* head) {\\n    if (!head || !head->next) {\\n        return false; // No cycle with 0 or 1 nodes\\n    }\\n    ListNode* slow = head->next;\\n    ListNode* fast = head->next->next;\\n    while (slow != fast) {\\n        if (!fast || !fast->next) {\\n            return false; // No cycle\\n        }\\n        slow = slow->next;\\n        fast = fast->next->next;\\n    }\\n    return true; // Cycle detected\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    // Example linked list with a cycle\\n    ListNode* head = new ListNode(3);\\n    head->next = new ListNode(2);\\n    head->next->next = new ListNode(0);\\n    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(-4);\\n    head->next->next->next->next = head->next; // Creating a cycle\\n\\n    bool hasCycleResult = hasCycle(head);\\n    std::cout << \"Has cycle: \" << (hasCycleResult ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\\n\\n    // Clean up memory (not shown in the example)\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen to use each version:\\n\\nVersion with Array (nums):\\nUse this version when you\\'re dealing with cyclic arrays or sequences, and you need to detect cycles or perform operations related to cycles.\\nVersion with Linked List:\\nUse this version when you\\'re working with linked lists and need to traverse, manipulate, or perform specific operations like detecting loops, finding middle elements, or merging lists."

This is often used in cyclic arrays or sequences where you want to detect cycles or perform some other operation. The idea is that the fast pointer advances faster than the slow pointer, and they might eventually meet or cross paths if there\\'s a cycle. This version is commonly used in algorithms like Floyd\\'s cycle detection algorithm for finding cycles in linked lists or arrays.\\nExample use cases:\\n\\nDetecting cycles in an array or linked list.\\nFinding the duplicate element in an array (Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare algorithm).\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <vector>\\n\\nbool hasCycle(const std::vector<int>& nums) {\\n    int slow = 0, fast = 0;\\n    while (true) {\\n        slow = nums[slow];\\n        fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n        if (slow == fast) {\\n            return true; // Cycle detected\\n        }\\n        if (slow < 0 || fast < 0 || fast >= nums.size()) {\\n            return false; // No cycle\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 2}; // Example cyclic array\\n    bool hasCycleResult = hasCycle(nums);\\n    std::cout << \"Has cycle: \" << (hasCycleResult ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2. Version with Linked List:\\nIn the second version, the slow and fast pointers are used in the context of a singly linked list. The fast pointer advances by two steps while the slow pointer advances by one step. This approach is often used for operations that require traversing or processing a linked list in a certain way.\\n\\nExample use cases:\\n\\nDetecting a loop in a linked list (similar to Floyd\\'s cycle detection in arrays).\\nFinding the middle element of a linked list.\\nChecking for palindromes in a linked list.\\nMerging two sorted linked lists.\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n\\nstruct ListNode {\\n    int val;\\n    ListNode* next;\\n    ListNode(int val) : val(val), next(nullptr) {}\\n};\\n\\nbool hasCycle(ListNode* head) {\\n    if (!head || !head->next) {\\n        return false; // No cycle with 0 or 1 nodes\\n    }\\n    ListNode* slow = head->next;\\n    ListNode* fast = head->next->next;\\n    while (slow != fast) {\\n        if (!fast || !fast->next) {\\n            return false; // No cycle\\n        }\\n        slow = slow->next;\\n        fast = fast->next->next;\\n    }\\n    return true; // Cycle detected\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    // Example linked list with a cycle\\n    ListNode* head = new ListNode(3);\\n    head->next = new ListNode(2);\\n    head->next->next = new ListNode(0);\\n    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(-4);\\n    head->next->next->next->next = head->next; // Creating a cycle\\n\\n    bool hasCycleResult = hasCycle(head);\\n    std::cout << \"Has cycle: \" << (hasCycleResult ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\\n\\n    // Clean up memory (not shown in the example)\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen to use each version:\\n\\nVersion with Array (nums):\\nUse this version when you\\'re dealing with cyclic arrays or sequences, and you need to detect cycles or perform operations related to cycles.\\nVersion with Linked List:\\nUse this version when you\\'re working with linked lists and need to traverse, manipulate, or perform specific operations like detecting loops, finding middle elements, or merging lists."

This approach is often used for operations that require traversing or processing a linked list in a certain way.\\n\\nExample use cases:\\n\\nDetecting a loop in a linked list (similar to Floyd\\'s cycle detection in arrays).\\nFinding the middle element of a linked list.\\nChecking for palindromes in a linked list.\\nMerging two sorted linked lists.\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n\\nstruct ListNode {\\n    int val;\\n    ListNode* next;\\n    ListNode(int val) : val(val), next(nullptr) {}\\n};\\n\\nbool hasCycle(ListNode* head) {\\n    if (!head || !head->next) {\\n        return false; // No cycle with 0 or 1 nodes\\n    }\\n    ListNode* slow = head->next;\\n    ListNode* fast = head->next->next;\\n    while (slow != fast) {\\n        if (!fast || !fast->next) {\\n            return false; // No cycle\\n        }\\n        slow = slow->next;\\n        fast = fast->next->next;\\n    }\\n    return true; // Cycle detected\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    // Example linked list with a cycle\\n    ListNode* head = new ListNode(3);\\n    head->next = new ListNode(2);\\n    head->next->next = new ListNode(0);\\n    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(-4);\\n    head->next->next->next->next = head->next; // Creating a cycle\\n\\n    bool hasCycleResult = hasCycle(head);\\n    std::cout << \"Has cycle: \" << (hasCycleResult ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\\n\\n    // Clean up memory (not shown in the example)\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen to use each version:\\n\\nVersion with Array (nums):\\nUse this version when you\\'re dealing with cyclic arrays or sequences, and you need to detect cycles or perform operations related to cycles.\\nVersion with Linked List:\\nUse this version when you\\'re working with linked lists and need to traverse, manipulate, or perform specific operations like detecting loops, finding middle elements, or merging lists."

This is often used in cyclic arrays or sequences where you want to detect cycles or perform some other operation. The idea is that the fast pointer advances faster than the slow pointer, and they might eventually meet or cross paths if there\\'s a cycle. This version is commonly used in algorithms like Floyd\\'s cycle detection algorithm for finding cycles in linked lists or arrays.\\nExample use cases:\\n\\nDetecting cycles in an array or linked list.\\nFinding the duplicate element in an array (Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare algorithm).\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include <vector>\\n\\nbool hasCycle(const std::vector<int>& nums) {\\n    int slow = 0, fast = 0;\\n    while (true) {\\n        slow = nums[slow];\\n        fast = nums[nums[fast]];\\n        if (slow == fast) {\\n            return true; // Cycle detected\\n        }\\n        if (slow < 0 || fast < 0 || fast >= nums.size()) {\\n            return false; // No cycle\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 2}; // Example cyclic array\\n    bool hasCycleResult = hasCycle(nums);\\n    std::cout << \"Has cycle: \" << (hasCycleResult ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2. Version with Linked List:\\nIn the second version, the slow and fast pointers are used in the context of a singly linked list. The fast pointer advances by two steps while the slow pointer advances by one step. This approach is often used for operations that require traversing or processing a linked list in a certain way.\\n\\nExample use cases:\\n\\nDetecting a loop in a linked list (similar to Floyd\\'s cycle detection in arrays).\\nFinding the middle element of a linked list.\\nChecking for palindromes in a linked list.\\nMerging two sorted linked lists.\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\n\\nstruct ListNode {\\n    int val;\\n    ListNode* next;\\n    ListNode(int val) : val(val), next(nullptr) {}\\n};\\n\\nbool hasCycle(ListNode* head) {\\n    if (!head || !head->next) {\\n        return false; // No cycle with 0 or 1 nodes\\n    }\\n    ListNode* slow = head->next;\\n    ListNode* fast = head->next->next;\\n    while (slow != fast) {\\n        if (!fast || !fast->next) {\\n            return false; // No cycle\\n        }\\n        slow = slow->next;\\n        fast = fast->next->next;\\n    }\\n    return true; // Cycle detected\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    // Example linked list with a cycle\\n    ListNode* head = new ListNode(3);\\n    head->next = new ListNode(2);\\n    head->next->next = new ListNode(0);\\n    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(-4);\\n    head->next->next->next->next = head->next; // Creating a cycle\\n\\n    bool hasCycleResult = hasCycle(head);\\n    std::cout << \"Has cycle: \" << (hasCycleResult ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << std::endl;\\n\\n    // Clean up memory (not shown in the example)\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen to use each version:\\n\\nVersion with Array (nums):\\nUse this version when you\\'re dealing with cyclic arrays or sequences, and you need to detect cycles or perform operations related to cycles.\\nVersion with Linked List:\\nUse this version when you\\'re working with linked lists and need to traverse, manipulate, or perform specific operations like detecting loops, finding middle elements, or merging lists."

If the second node is part of the cycle and the second node points to the third node (by definition), the third node is also part of the cycle. You cannot have the situation that the second and 4th node are part of the cycle but the third node is not.\\n\\nAnd then, you can use the logic of the walker and runner variable.\\n\\nOnce, the runner is in the cycle, we will just run around it again and again. Yes, it skips one node every time, but this doesn\\'t matter yet. Assuming, the runner is already in the cycle going in circles, the walker will eventually reach that cycle, too (if it exists).\\n\\nNow, we have the following situation: The runner moves to steps a time, the walker moves one step a time. Lets say, the gap between the runner is of length n. Every time the walker moves one step and the runner moves two steps, this length between the two gets reduced by exactly one. As this gap gets smaller by exactly one per iteration, you will not jump over the walker with the runner by doing two steps at a time while the walker does one.\\n\\nBy that, you will eventually get the situation, that the runner is equal to the walker (if there exists a circle). \\n\\nTo be honest, in the beginning, it was confusing for me, too, that the runner wont skip over the walker. But this argument of the gap getting smaller only by one per iteration answered, why we can\\'t skip over the walker with the runner without having the equality first."

Later I just blindly use a continuously appended list of heads (a bit dumb) but it works (with runtime <6%  with >1 sec). \\n\\nPlease someone confirms if my understanding is correct.... (i have no formal CS degree so not sure these link-lists are common things in pro-world)\\n......\\nData structure has two elements [value, memory address] or  [v, add] for short..\\nThese data are stored in the memory with address following :\\n\\nMemory -->  what stored in that place\\nadd_0 --> [ val_1, add_1]\\nadd_1 --> [ val_2, add_2]\\nadd_2 --> [ val_3, add_3]\\nadd_3 --> [ val_4, add_1]    # now this is circulating back to add_1\\n\\n\\'head\\' variable actually stored \\'add_0\\', the memory address of [ val, add]..  and  \\'head.val\\' give the \\'val_1\\' (which never used) and \\'head.next\\' give the memory address \\'add_1\\' stored in the head. So when I use    \\'p = head.next\\'... now \\'p = add_1\\'   and   \\'p.val = val_2\\' and \\'p.next = add_2\\'..\\n\\nis that correct.???? I believe that is why there is no two \\'heads\\' alike without cycling but there may be possible that values are circulating .. eg: [head.next.val for i in range(x)]  could gives  [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... so on ]  with repeating pattern of values without \"cycling\" in their sense."

It can be achieved by recursion or more efficiently by dp.\\n\\nRecursion:\\n\\n    public List<Integer> diffWaysToCompute(String input) {\\n        List<Integer> result=new ArrayList<>();\\n        if(input==null||input.length()==0)  return result;\\n        List<String> ops=new ArrayList<>();\\n        for(int i=0; i<input.length(); i++){\\n            int j=i;\\n            while(j<input.length()&&Character.isDigit(input.charAt(j)))\\n                j++;\\n            String num=input.substring(i, j);\\n            ops.add(num);\\n            if(j!=input.length())   ops.add(input.substring(j, j+1));\\n            i=j;\\n        }\\n        result=compute(ops, 0, ops.size()-1);\\n        return result;\\n    }\\n    private List<Integer> compute(List<String> ops, int lo, int hi){\\n        List<Integer> result=new ArrayList<>();\\n        if(lo==hi){\\n            Integer num=Integer.valueOf(ops.get(lo));\\n            result.add(num);\\n            return result;\\n        }\\n        for(int i=lo+1; i<=hi-1; i=i+2){\\n            String operator=ops.get(i);\\n            List<Integer> left=compute(ops,lo, i-1), right=compute(ops, i+1, hi);\\n            for(int leftNum:left)\\n                for(int rightNum: right){\\n                    if(operator.equals(\"+\"))\\n                        result.add(leftNum+rightNum);\\n                    else if(operator.equals(\"-\"))\\n                        result.add(leftNum-rightNum);\\n                    else\\n                        result.add(leftNum*rightNum);\\n                }\\n        }\\n        return result;\\n    }\\n\\n\\nAnd DP, where dp[i][j] stores all possible results from the i-th integer to the j-th integer (inclusive) in the list.\\n\\n    public List<Integer> diffWaysToCompute(String input) {\\n        List<Integer> result=new ArrayList<>();\\n        if(input==null||input.length()==0)  return result;\\n        List<String> ops=new ArrayList<>();\\n        for(int i=0; i<input.length(); i++){\\n            int j=i;\\n            while(j<input.length()&&Character.isDigit(input.charAt(j)))\\n                j++;\\n            ops.add(input.substring(i, j));\\n            if(j!=input.length())   ops.add(input.substring(j, j+1));\\n            i=j;\\n        }\\n        int N=(ops.size()+1)/2; //num of integers\\n        ArrayList<Integer>[][] dp=(ArrayList<Integer>[][]) new ArrayList[N][N];\\n        for(int d=0; d<N; d++){\\n            if(d==0){\\n                for(int i=0; i<N; i++){\\n                    dp[i][i]=new ArrayList<>();\\n                    dp[i][i].add(Integer.valueOf(ops.get(i*2)));\\n                }\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n            for(int i=0; i<N-d; i++){\\n                dp[i][i+d]=new ArrayList<>();\\n                for(int j=i; j<i+d; j++){\\n                    ArrayList<Integer> left=dp[i][j], right=dp[j+1][i+d];\\n                    String operator=ops.get(j*2+1);\\n                    for(int leftNum:left)\\n                        for(int rightNum:right){\\n                            if(operator.equals(\"+\"))\\n                                dp[i][i+d].add(leftNum+rightNum);\\n                            else if(operator.equals(\"-\"))\\n                                dp[i][i+d].add(leftNum-rightNum);\\n                            else\\n                                dp[i][i+d].add(leftNum*rightNum);\\n                        }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return dp[0][N-1];\\n    }",

Different Ways To Add Parentheses (medium)\\n\\n_Given a string expression of numbers and operators, return all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators. You may return the answer in any order.\\nThe test cases are generated such that the output values fit in a 32-bit integer and the number of different results does not exceed 10<sup>4</sup>._\\n\\n### **Constraints:**\\n\\n_1 <= expression.length <= 20  \\nExpression consists of digits and the operator \\'+\\', \\'-\\', and \\'\\\\*\\'.  \\nAll the integer values in the input expression are in the range [0, 99]._\\n\\n### **Testcases:**\\n\\nExample 1:\\n\\n- Input: expression = \"2-1-1\"  \\n  Output: [0,2]  \\n  Explanation:  \\n  ((2-1)-1) = 0  \\n  (2-(1-1)) = 2\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\n- Input: expression = \"2\\\\*3-4\\\\*5\"  \\n  Output: [-34,-14,-10,-10,10]  \\n  Explanation:  \\n  (2*(3-(4\\\\*5))) = -34  \\n  ((2*3)-(4\\\\*5)) = -14  \\n  ((2\\\\*(3-4))\\\\*5) = -10  \\n  (2\\\\*((3-4)\\\\*5)) = -10  \\n  (((2\\\\*3)-4)\\\\*5) = 10\\n\\n## Approach:\\n\\nAccording to _BODMAS_, parentheses (or brackets) mean that some operations have higher priority than others. e.g. **_(a \\\\* (b - c))_** implies that subtraction needs to be done first and then the difference is multiplied with **_a_**. Whereas **_((a \\\\* b) - c)_** implies that the multiplication will take place first and then **_c_** will be subtracted from the product. Different occurrences of parentheses can set different priorities.\\n\\nAn important observation here is that parentheses can change priorities only when used around operators. If we have a simple expression like **(2 - 4 \\\\* 1 + 8)**. Iterating from the beginning ->\\n\\n**(2 - (4 \\\\* 1 + 8))** is now serated into 2 parts around minus sign. We can recursively iterate over both the separated part two set parentheses.\\n\\n**(2 - ((4 \\\\* 1) + 8))** gives ans = **-10**  \\nreturning to previous recursion call and setting parentheses around another operator  \\n**(2 - (4 \\\\* (1 + 8)))** gives ans = **-34**  \\nreturning to previous recursion call and doing the same thing  \\n**((2 - 4) \\\\* (1 + 8))** ...  \\n**((2 - 4 \\\\* 1) + 8)** ...\\n\\nSo we iterate the expression from left side  \\nwhenever an operator is encountered, the expression is recusively divided around the operator into 2 sub-expressions (sub-expression **left** and sub-expression **right**). This recursive division occurs until **left** and **right** both have only single number (i.e. no operator). All answers from a particular sub-expressions are returned in a list called **result**. The **result** of left sub-expression is returned in **left** and so is the case with **right**. Then all the answers from **left** and **right** are iterated and are operated upon.\\n\\nThe approach is known as **_\"Divide and Conquer\"_**. The problem is divided into subproblems, and those subproblems are further divided into sub-problems. The solution to subproblems helps to find solution for parent problem. If some subproblems are repeated, we can memoize solution to every subproblem and use it whenever the same subproblem reoccurs. This method is called **_Dynamic Programming_**.\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/e4b07063-d5b7-4244-b972-b62684c058b2_1659440138.4830947.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n## Code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int operate(int x, int y, char op) {\\n        if(op == \\'+\\') return x + y;\\n        if(op == \\'-\\') return x - y;\\n        if(op == \\'*\\') return x * y;\\n        return 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    vector<int> diffWaysToCompute(string expression) {\\n        vector<int> results;\\n        bool isEntirelyNumber = true;\\n\\n        for (int i = 0; i < expression.length(); i++) {\\n            if (!isdigit(expression[i])) {\\n                isEntirelyNumber = false;\\n\\n                vector<int> left = diffWaysToCompute(expression.substr(0, i));\\n                vector<int> right = diffWaysToCompute(expression.substr(i + 1, expression.length()));\\n\\n                for (int x: left) {\\n                    for (int y: right) results.push_back(operate(x, y, expression[i]));\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        if (isEntirelyNumber) results.push_back(stoi(expression));\\n        return results;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n##### ***Kindly upvote the post if you found it useful.

                "content": "First note: When students are learning to code in early days, you know what instructors tell them??? To add comments to your code so that it\\'s easier for others to read/follow. I think a lot of people here missed that session of  coding 101 class!!! :D :D \\n\\nI\\'m using [@caikehe](https://leetcode.com/problems/different-ways-to-add-parentheses/discuss/66419/Python-easy-to-understand-solution-(divide-and-conquer).) code. \\n\\nYou might ask what is the high level idea? Let\\' check some cases first to see if they\\'re valid operations! can we do `5 - - 1` or `5 - 1 + + 3` or `4 + 4 - * 3`? No, right? We need to have something like ` 5  + 5` or ` 5 - 3` or `3 * 5` in the most basic cases, true? That\\'s what we\\'ll do. We try to break down the string to building components and build our way up to get to the final result. This is what the `helper` function is trying to do. If you check this function, you\\'ll see it\\'s doing the most basic operations (meaning `-` or `+` or `*`) given two numbers `m` and `n`. Can you do any other operation than ` m + n` if you\\'re given `m`, `n`, `+`? or other than `m * n` if you\\'re given `m`, `n` and `*`? No, right? You get the idea. So if we knew two numbers and one operator, `helper` function would give us the only possible operation. \\n\\nHowever, we are given a string of numbers and operators, something like `input = \\'2-1-1\\'` (example provided in the problem statement).  The combinations are `((2-1)-1) = 0 ` and `(2-(1-1)) = 2`. Let\\'s focus on the first combination.  `((2-1)-1) = 0 `  has two components `a = (2-1)` and  `(a - 1)`. `a` is a number, 1. If you check the first component (`(2-1)`), this is a base case that can be handled by `helper` function, right? If you get this, what will remain? The second component which is the first one minus `1`, right? What is this now? Another base component, true? Again, `helper` will be able to handle it. Do you see where I\\'m going with this? Let\\'s say you have `input =  \"2*3-4*5\"`. If you could break it to a base case (meaning `m`, `n` and and operator), then you\\'re done. Does this make sense? \\n\\nWhatever I mentioned in the previous paragraph was for a specific arrangement of parantheses, right? For example if we had `(2*(3-(4*5)))`, we would first go and take care of `(4*5)` using `helper` function. Let\\'s call it `a` again. `a = (4*5) = 20`. Now, `(2(3-(4*5))) = (2(3-a))`. Then, let\\'s take care of `(3-a)` using `helper` function because it\\'s two numbers and one operator. Let\\'s call it `b`. So, `b = (3-a) = -17`. Finally, `(2*b)`!!! Again, a base case  that can be handled by `helper` function. You got it, right? Good!\\n\\nNow, we could generate all valid arrangement of parantheses (come up with multiple equations) and break each equation to base cases and we\\'ll be done. Here comes the divide and conquer-style part of the solution, where you traverse through the input (`#4`) and do some stuff whenever you reach to an operator (`+-*`, line `#5`). This is the place that we\\'re putting virtual paranthesis (we don\\'t need to actually add paranthesis to string or anything like that) to do the grouping of numbers and operators. The **key point** of this solution is that operators are the places you want have a `)` before and a `(` after. Think about it!!! If `input = \"(2*3-4*5)\"`, you traverse in the string, you get to the first `*`. What do you do? You add one paranthesis before `)*` and one paranthesis after `*(`, which gives you `\"(2)*(3-4*5)\"`. Lines `#6` and `#7` take care of each part separately, namely line `#6` takes `(2)` and line `#7` takes `(3-4*5)`. Note than index `i` in the `for` loop corresponds to the operator (here `*`) and we don\\'t include the operator itself since an operator cannot be the first element of a string nor can it be the last element of the string, i.e. having `(2*)` or `*(3-4*5)` is not valid. What happens next? The first component (`(2)`) doesn\\'t need any extra calculation and it can be a `m` for `helper` function. So, it will need a `n` and an operator. However, second component (`(3-4*5)`) (I call these two first level components)  is not totally broken down yet, that\\'s why we cannot move to line `#8`, YET!\\n\\n\\nTo wrap up so far in case it\\'s not fully clear! First component (`(2)`) is taken by line `#6` which runs the `diffWaysToCompute` function again from start. What is line `#1`? It asks if the input is all digits, which is the case for the rhis component (`(2)`), right? Therefore, it returns `2` in line `#2`, correct? This makes `res1` to be `2`. For the second components, however, line `#7` takes `(3-4*5)` as `input`. This causes to run `diffWaysToCompute` function again, this time line `#1` condition is not satisfied since the string include operators and not just digits. So, it goes to line `#4` to traverse through the string and get stuck again in an operator, this time at `-`. The new two components (*I call these two second level components*) would be `(3)` and `(4*5)`. First one would be similar to `(2)` as explained before. The second component is a base case that can be handled by  `helper` function and is taken to the function of line `#7` for further process. Line `#7` executes the `diffWaysToCompute` for `input = (4*5)`, which results in `res1 = 4` and `res2 = 5`, right? (We\\'re on the third level now). \\n\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n\\n    def diffWaysToCompute(self, input):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type input: str\\n        :rtype: List[int]\\n        \"\"\"\\n        \\n        if input.isdigit(): #1\\n            return [int(input)] #2\\n        res = [] #3\\n        for i in xrange(len(input)): #4\\n            if input[i] in \"-+*\": #5\\n                res1 = self.diffWaysToCompute(input[:i]) #6\\n                res2 = self.diffWaysToCompute(input[i+1:]) #7\\n                for j in res1:#8\\n                    for k in res2: #9\\n                        res.append(self.helper(j, k, input[i])) #10\\n        return res #11\\n    \\n    def helper(self, m, n, op): #12\\n        if op == \"+\": #13\\n            return m+n #14\\n        elif op == \"-\": #15\\n            return m-n #16\\n        else: #17\\n            return m*n #18\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, after breaking down to the lowest level (in this case third level components), we move forward with the code to line `#8`. Remember that for the third level components, `res1 = 4` and `res2 = 5`, right? We do two nested loops in lines `#8` and `#9` to traverse through both `res1` and `res2` (remember that each level has its own `res1` and `res2`. Now we\\'re at level three). After the nested loops, we go to line `#10` where we call the `helper` function. This function needs three inputs. First one is the number  of `res1`, the second is the number of `res2` and the third is the operator that helped us to break the input into two components to pass to line `#6` and `#7`, right? The operator is `*` in this level. Therefore, the `helper` function is called in line `#10` with `j = 4`, `k = 5`, and `input[i] = *`. Lines `#12` to `#18` take care of this. Here, it\\'s a `*` which is handled by line `#17` and `#18`. So, this function returns 20. This is the ouput of level three. We go one level up to level two. With `res1 = 3` and `res2 = 20` (remember `res2` comes from third level). We call the `helper` function again with these values and the operator to be `-`, right? This gives up `-17` as the output of level two. We go one level up to level one where `res1 = 2` and `res2 = -17` with `*` as operator. `helper` function would return `-34` for this case. Makes sense? No? Please read again and if it\\'s still not clear, let me know if the comments which part is not clear. \\n\\n\\nWe covered just one case of parantheses arrangement, `(2*(3-(4*5)))`. Now what? We covered the first encounter of an operator in line `#4`, the `for` loop would move forward to until it gets to the next operator. Remember that whatever we\\'ve talked about so far was for the case where the `for` loop arrived at the first operator `*`, and in the second level, got stuck at `-` operator. Now, if in the second level, it arrives to the second `*`, we recover the case of `(2*((3-4)*5)) = -10 `. Note that both of these cases have the number `2` separated from the rest of the string. Next, the `for` loop moves back to level one and goes on and it arrive to `-` operator. Splits the string to `(2*3)` and `(4*5)! We get to `res1 = 6` and `res2 = 20` after doing to level two and coming back. So, the result of this case is `-14`.  And so one for to cover all cases. \\n\\nNote: Someone might wonder why the `res = []` is defined initially and gets updated within the nested `for` loop, how it keeps track of everything? Good question. Since we\\'re moving downward to lower levels, `res` keeps track of values of that particular level which it will return to be either `res1` or `res2` for upper level. When the code is executing the upper level, `res` gets initialized again and this process goes one. So, `res` does not keep track of every level, just the level we\\'re dealing with. Now, this causes extra calculations since for example if we had something line `(4*5) - (4*5)`, it would calculate each of the `4*5` separately which is not efficient. That\\'s why we can do memoization (keeping track of level so we prevent excessive calculations) as you may have seen in some solutions. Including this is not difficulat. You just need to re-arrange your function a little bit! [This](https://leetcode.com/problems/different-ways-to-add-parentheses/discuss/66438/Divide-and-Conquer-%2B-Memorization-Python) shows such a solution. Note that nothing has really changed from above solution except that [@orbuluh](https://leetcode.com/problems/different-ways-to-add-parentheses/discuss/66438/Divide-and-Conquer-%2B-Memorization-Python) moved everything to a helper function. This helper function is our `diffWaysToCompute` function in addition to a `seen = {}` dictionary which can keep track of results. When you have your two numbers and one operator and want to call the `helper` function that we used, it first checks to see if it has already seen these numbers and operator. If yes, it just calls it from hashtable which is `O(1)` and you can save some time this way. \\n\\n\\nYou\\'re done! Good job. \\n\\n\\n\\n======================================================================\\nFinal note: Please let me know if you found any type/error, etc. I\\'ll try to fix it. \\n\\nFinal note 2: I believe explaining something for other in a simplest possible manner would help me to learn better a subject. So, thanks for reading. I suggest you to do the same in case you didn\\'t fully understand the solution. \\n\\n",

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n\\n# Approach\\nWe can use divide and conquer approach to solve this problem. We can divide the given expression into two parts at each operator, and recursively calculate the results for each part. Finally, we can combine the results using the given operator to get the final result.\\n\\nFor example, for the expression \"23-45\", we can split it into two parts at the operator \\'-\\': \"23\" and \"45\". Then we can split each part at the operator \\'\\', and calculate the results for each sub-expression: \"23\" can be split into \"2\" and \"3\", and we can calculate the results for them as [2] and [3], respectively. Similarly, \"4*5\" can be split into \"4\" and \"5\", and we can calculate the results for them as [4] and [5], respectively.\\n\\nNext, we can combine the results for each sub-expression using the operator \\'-\\', which gives us the following possibilities: [2-4, 2-5, 3-4, 3-5]. Similarly, we can combine the results for each sub-expression using the operator \\'\\', which gives us the following possibilities: [24, 25, 34, 3*5].\\n\\nFinally, we can combine the results using the operator \\'-\\', which gives us the final results: [-34, -10, -14, -10, 10].\\n\\nAlgorithm:\\n\\n1. Define a function diffWaysToCompute() which accepts the input expression string inputStr.\\n2. If the input string only has digits, return a list with that number.\\n3. Iterate through each character of the input string inputStr and check if it is an operator or not.\\n4. If the character is an operator, recursively call the diffWaysToCompute() function for the left and right substrings of the operator, and combine the results using the operator.\\n5. Append the result to the output list outputList.\\n6. Return the outputList.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def diffWaysToCompute(self, inputStr: str) -> List[int]:\\n        \\n        # Define a function to calculate the result of the given operator between two numbers\\n        def calc(left, right, operator):\\n            if operator == \\'+\\':\\n                return left + right\\n            elif operator == \\'-\\':\\n                return left - right\\n            elif operator == \\'*\\':\\n                return left * right\\n        \\n        # Define the main function to calculate all possible results\\n        def diffWaysToComputeHelper(inputStr):\\n            \\n            # If the input string only has digits, return a list with that number\\n            if inputStr.isdigit():\\n                return [int(inputStr)]\\n            \\n            # Initialize the output list\\n            outputList = []\\n            \\n            # Iterate through each character of the input string and check if it is an operator or not\\n            for i in range(len(inputStr)):\\n                if inputStr[i] in [\\'+\\', \\'-\\', \\'*\\']:\\n                    \\n                    # Recursively call the `diffWaysToCompute()` function for the left and right substrings of the operator\\n                    leftResults = diffWaysToComputeHelper(inputStr[:i])\\n                    rightResults = diffWaysToComputeHelper(inputStr[i+1:])\\n                    \\n                    # Combine the results using the operator\\n                    for left in leftResults:\\n                        for right in rightResults:\\n                            outputList.append(calc(left, right, inputStr[i]))\\n            \\n            # Return the output list\\n            return outputList\\n        \\n        # Call the helper function\\n        return diffWaysToComputeHelper(inputStr)\\n\\n```",

BUT !!!**\\nYou see there\\'s `we have 2 branches here!!!` ???\\n!!! This is where we figure out that **we need to return an array for `left` and `right` parts** after the expression split. !!!\\n\\nThus the pseudo code for the solve function is:\\n```\\nres = []\\nfor k in range(left, right + 1):\\n  left = solve(left, k - 1)\\n  right = solve(k + 1, right)\\n  for l in left:\\n    for r in right:\\n      if op = \\'+\\':\\n        res.append(l + r)  \\n\\t\\t...\\nif len(res) == 0: # could not process any signs, means we\\'re dealing with a number\\n  res.append(parse_number(left, right))\\n```\\nDivide & concur in action. Then do `op` on all left and right value combinations.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe approach is quite similar to a partition dp type problems aka [Matrix chain multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_chain_multiplication) variation (MCM).\\n\\nHere are similar problems. Most of these are hard and true DP.\\n* 312. Burst Balloons (partition based on inflating a ballon, instead of popping them)\\n* 1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick (partition on a cut)\\n* 1000.

Let\\'s look at the provided example:\\n\\nExample: `2 * 3 - 4 * 5`\\n\\n*Here, in the examples, I will use \"**) operation (**\" as a partition point*\\n\\n\"1st-level\" partitions:\\n\\n1st partition point: `(2) * (3-4*5)`\\n2nd partition point: `(2*3) - (4*5)`\\n3rd partition point: `(2*3-4) * (5)`\\n\\n\"2nd-level\" partitions:\\n* `(3-4*5)`\\n1st partition point: `(3) - (4*5)`\\n2nd partition point: `(3-4) * (5)`\\n* `(2*3-4)`\\n1st partition point: `(2) * (3-4)`\\n2nd partition point: `(2*3) - (4)`\\n\\n**The following is the most important part:**\\n\\n\"1st-level\" + 2 x \"2nd-level\" partitions will result in:\\n\\n`(2) * ((3) - (4*5))` and `(2) * ((3-4) * (5))`\\n\\nAs we can see from the expressions above in order to get the final result, **we will have 2 outputs from the above expressions,** we need to peform **left partition (2)** operation \"-\" **each of right partition cases `(3) - (4*5)`, `(3-4) * (5)`**.\\n\\nWhat if we have `(a * b + c) - (d * e - f)` ???\\n\\nWe will have to calc on the left side: `[\"(a) * (b + c)\", \"(a * b) + (c)\"]` and on the right side: `[\"(d) * (e - f)\", \"(d * e) - (f)\"]`. Let\\'s define previous expressions as `[A,B]` and `[C,D]`\\n\\nThe product of left partitioning and right partitioning will be: `[A - C], [A - D], [B - C], [B - D]`\\n\\n---\\n\\nHere is the longer version, but more readable:\\n\\n**Top-down approach (recursive):**\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def diffWaysToCompute(self, s: str) -> List[int]:\\n        def solve(start, end):\\n            out = []\\n\\t\\t\\t# if the range is number - return number (as expressions look like \\'num operation num\\', so start and end are nums)\\n            if start == end:\\n                return [ops[start]]\\n            \\n\\t\\t\\t# split the list by each operation into left and right expressions\\n            for k in range(start + 1, end, 2): # operation is +2 away from another operation\\n                left = solve(start, k - 1) # up to operation char\\n                right = solve(k + 1, end) # right next after the operation char\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t# product of left results \\'operation\\' right results\\n                for l in left:\\n                    for r in right:\\n                        if ops[k] == \"+\":\\n                            out.append(l + r)\\n                        elif ops[k] == \"-\":\\n                            out.append(l - r)\\n                        else:\\n                            out.append(l * r)\\n            \\n            return out\\n        \\n\\t\\t# convert string \"55*2+34\" to [55,\"*\",2,\"+\",34]\\n        ops = []\\n        for c in s:\\n            if not c.isnumeric():\\n                ops.append(c)\\n            else:\\n                if not ops or ops and type(ops[-1]) == type(\"\"):\\n                    ops.append(0)\\n                ops[-1] *= 10\\n                ops[-1] += int(c)\\n        \\n        N = len(ops)\\n        return solve(0, N - 1)\\n```\\n\\n**Recursive + memoization:**\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def diffWaysToCompute(self, s: str) -> List[int]:\\n        @cache\\n        def solve(start, end):\\n            out = []\\n            for k in range(start, end + 1):\\n                c = s[k]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                if c in (\"+\",\"-\",\"*\"):\\n                    left = solve(start, k - 1)\\n                    right = solve(k + 1, end)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                    for l in left:\\n                        for r in right:\\n                            if c == \"+\":\\n                                out.append(l + r)\\n                            elif c == \"-\":\\n                                out.append(l - r)\\n                            else:\\n                                out.append(l * r)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n            if not out: # nothing was split, must be a number\\n                out.append(int(s[start: end + 1]))\\n\\n            return out\\n\\n        N = len(s)\\n        return solve(0, N - 1)\\n```\\n\\n**Iterative approach:**\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def diffWaysToCompute(self, s: str) -> List[int]:\\n        N = len(s)\\n        dp = [[[0]] * (N + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]\\n        \\n        for start in reversed(range(N)):\\n            for end in range(start, N):\\n                out = []\\n                for k in range(start, end + 1):\\n                    c = s[k]\\n\\n                    if c in \"+-*\":\\n                        left = dp[start][k - 1]\\n                        right = dp[k + 1][end]\\n\\n                        if left and right:\\n                            for l,r in product(left, right):\\n                                if c == \"+\": out.append(l + r)\\n                                elif c == \"-\": out.append(l - r)\\n                                else: out.append(l * r)\\n\\n                if not out: out.append(int(s[start: end + 1]))\\n                dp[start][end] = out\\n\\n        return dp[0][N - 1]\\n```\\n\\nP.S. Regarding DP. Yes there are subproblems. Some are independent. Some are repeatable (overlapping). But there is no optimal substructure (at least in the case). So technically we are not optimizing anything here (the core of dp). This one will be a DP if you add some min/max/optimize (like in cut the stick or burst balloons problems). Here we used the same idea to **enumerate all possible** parenthesis placement + memo. Maybe iterative D&C.",

                "content": "### Solution\\n\\n#### Analysis\\nAdding parentheses here is actually changing the calculation order and intuitively we can come up with a solution using recursion which via a calculation string and output the different results for different parentheses. Recursion can be solved by itself in limited range, which is the core of it. \\n\\n- to avoid further modifying the input string, we use begin and end to limit the range and in each invoking we create a new vector to store the results, then we return the vector;\\n- the last calculation which can happen in all the operators, so we split the string by the different operators (sometimes we have to think in a reverse opposite way to ease the difficulty, so here we care about the last) so as the recursion rule goes, the left and right substring will also have different results themselves and now what we need to do is combine them with the last operator one by one;\\n- as for termination condition: there is no operator between begin and end position, so we then can just convert the string to an integer and return.\\n\\n#### Pure recursive\\nThe recursive solution in C++ is as follows:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\nprivate:\\n    int sLen;\\n    vector<int> helper(const string& s, int begin, int end)\\n    {\\n        vector<int> v;\\n        if(begin > end) return v; \\n        for(int i = begin; i <= end; ++i)\\n        {\\n            if(!isdigit(s[i]))\\n            {\\n                vector<int> l = helper(s, begin, i-1), r = helper(s, i+1, end);\\n                for(int j = 0; j < l.size(); ++j)\\n                {\\n                    for(int k = 0; k < r.size(); ++k)\\n                    {\\n                        switch(s[i])\\n                        {\\n                            case '-': v.push_back(l[j]-r[k]); break;\\n                            case '+': v.push_back(l[j]+r[k]); break;\\n                            case '*': v.push_back(l[j]*r[k]); break;\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        if(v.empty()) v.push_back(stoi(s.substr(begin, end-begin+1)));\\n        return v;\\n    }\\npublic:\\n    vector<int> diffWaysToCompute(string input) {\\n        sLen = input.length();\\n        return helper(input, 0, sLen-1);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThere is a more terse solution in C++, though less efficient.\\n\\n```\\nvector<int> diffWaysToCompute(string s) \\n{\\n\\tif(s.empty()) return vector<int>();\\n\\tvector<int> v;\\n\\tfor(int i = 0; s[i]; ++i)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tif(!isdigit(s[i]))\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\tfor(int a: diffWaysToCompute(s.substr(0, i)))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor(int b: diffWaysToCompute(s.substr(i+1)))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif(s[i] == '-') v.push_back(a-b);\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif(s[i] == '+') v.push_back(a+b);\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif(s[i] == '*') v.push_back(a*b);\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn v.size()? v : vector<int>{stoi(s)};\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Memoization\\n\\nOf course, there should be a DP or Memoization solution, since there are lots of overlapping sub-problems and when the string becomes large, its performance will be definitely a problem. So here is a Memoization solution in C++. DP can do also do but that will be wanting in simplicity here. But so notoriuos as Momoization always is, the space it's to cost is rather costly here. Balance it in different cases is what we should always care about.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\nprivate:\\n    int sLen;\\n    vector<int> helper(const string& s, int begin, int end, vector<vector<vector<int>>>& matrix)\\n    {\\n        vector<int> v;\\n        if(begin > end) return v; \\n        if(matrix[begin][end].size()) return matrix[begin][end];\\n        for(int i = begin; i <= end; ++i)\\n        {\\n            if(!isdigit(s[i]))\\n            {\\n                vector<int> l = helper(s, begin, i-1, matrix), r = helper(s, i+1, end, matrix);\\n                for(int j = 0; j < l.size(); ++j)\\n                {\\n                    for(int k = 0; k < r.size(); ++k)\\n                    {\\n                        switch(s[i])\\n                        {\\n                            case '-': v.push_back(l[j]-r[k]); break;\\n                            case '+': v.push_back(l[j]+r[k]); break;\\n                            case '*': v.push_back(l[j]*r[k]); break;\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        matrix[begin][end] = v.size()? v : vector<int>{stoi(s.substr(begin, end-begin+1))};\\n        return matrix[begin][end];\\n    }\\npublic:\\n    vector<int> diffWaysToCompute(string input) {\\n        sLen = input.length();\\n        vector<vector<vector<int>>> matrix(sLen, vector<vector<int>>(sLen));\\n        return helper(input, 0, sLen-1, matrix);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n#### DP\\nIt's not good to leave the DP alone. So here it is, the DP solution though it's not that intuitive and easy to accomplish as Memoization.\\n\\n- split the input string into number strings and operator strings\\n- start to calculate from one string till all of them including numbers and operators\\n- move 2 steps forward each time since there are operators among numbers, while we only care about numbers\\n- in each range, we only calculate when encountering operators and as before we combine the results from left side and right side using the current operator\\n\\nThe whole solution in C++ is as follows. In summary, though it's not that intuitive to achieve a DP solution here, but it's quite a balance between performance and space cost between recursive (which re-calculates lots of over-lapping sub-problems) and Memoizationet (which costs lots of redundant space not only in storing but recursive function invoking).\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<int> diffWaysToCompute(string input) \\n    {\\n        vector<string> parts;\\n        string s;\\n        for(int i = 0; i <= input.length(); ++i)\\n        {\\n            if(isdigit(input[i])) s += input[i];\\n            else\\n            {\\n                parts.push_back(s);\\n                s.clear();\\n                if(input[i] != '\\\\0') parts.push_back(string(1, input[i]));\\n            }\\n        }\\n        int size = parts.size();\\n        vector<vector<vector<int>>> matrix(size, vector<vector<int>>(size));\\n        for(int d = 0; d < size; d += 2)\\n        {\\n            for(int l = 0; l < size-d; ++l)\\n            {\\n                if(!isdigit(parts[l][0])) continue;\\n                if(d == 0) matrix[l][l].push_back(stoi(parts[l]));\\n                int r = l+d;\\n                for(int k = l; k <= r; ++k)\\n                {\\n                    if(!isdigit(parts[k][0]))\\n                    {\\n                        for(auto a: matrix[l][k-1])\\n                            for(auto b: matrix[k+1][r])\\n                            {\\n                                if(parts[k] == \"-\") matrix[l][r].push_back(a-b);\\n                                if(parts[k] == \"+\") matrix[l][r].push_back(a+b);\\n                                if(parts[k] == \"*\") matrix[l][r].push_back(a*b);\\n                            }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return matrix[0][size-1];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\nAlways welcome new ideas and `practical` tricks, just leave them in the comments!",

However, we cannot access the `right_val` when we are iterating from left to right. \\n\\n**Non-intuitive**: \\n1. Use the DP iteration technique **extend-right-then-reverse-extend-left** (I coined the term) when iterating through the string. In other words, for a string like this `a + b - c * d`, our operations are `\"<<a + b>> - c * d\"  ->  \"<a + <b - c>> * d\" -> \"<<a + b - c>> * d\" -> \"<a + b - <c * d>>\" -> \"<a + <b - c * d>>\" -> \"<<a + b - c * d>>\"` \\n2. Store the integers and operational characters in two different arrays. To find the result of `integers[start:end+1]`, the operational characters between them are `ops[start:end]`. E.g. `s = \"6 - 3 + 1\" ==> integers = [6, 3, 1]; ops = [-, +]`\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def diffWaysToCompute(self, input: str) -> List[int]:\\n        nums = []\\n        ops = []\\n        \\n        num = 0\\n        for i in range(len(input)):\\n            if input[i] in \\'+-*\\':\\n                nums.append(num)\\n                num = 0\\n                ops.append(input[i])\\n            else:\\n                num = num * 10 + int(input[i])\\n        nums.append(num)\\n        \\n        dp = [[[] for _ in range(len(nums))] for _ in range(len(nums))] \\n        for end in range(len(nums)):\\n            for start in reversed(range(end + 1)):\\n                if start == end:\\n                    dp[start][end].append(nums[start])\\n                else:\\n                    for op in range(start, end):\\n                        for lval in dp[start][op]:\\n                            for rval in dp[op+1][end]:\\n                                if ops[op] == \\'+\\':\\n                                    dp[start][end].append(lval + rval)\\n                                elif ops[op] == \\'-\\':\\n                                    dp[start][end].append(lval - rval)\\n                                else:\\n                                    dp[start][end].append(lval * rval)\\n\\n        return dp[0][-1]\\n```",

Guess it pays to step back and evalute individually vs. mechanically just applying previous techniques. Isnt this is still an application of Catalin Numbers? I believe so. I still need to work out the math for the time complexity. Space Complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input as at one time no more than n layers be placed on the stack.\\n\\nThe key insite to this is dividing the array correctly when we see an operator.\\nEx. [2 - 1 -1] -> \\n\\noption 1:\\n[2] - [1-1]\\n[pre] - [post]\\n\\noption 2:\\n[2 -1] - [1]\\n[pre] - [post]\\n\\nRecusive Steps:\\nOn the way down we do the split detailed above. \\nThe stop condition is when we have no more operators on the statement.\\nOn the way back up from the recursion we do the actual calculation based on the operator we encountered.\\n\\n\\nAfter determining Recursive Algorithm. The next question is how can you speed it up? We know that we will see same string multiple times. So rather than recalculate it all the time, we store the result with a hash with the input as the key and result as the value. Whenever we encounter this input, we just return the saved value, thus saving us a recalcuation.\\n(When i added memoization to this solution, it effectively halved the time)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

                "content": "### Introduction\\n\\nGiven an unknown implementation of a nested list structure containing integer values, design an iterator as a wrapper for the nested list structure which allows for 1) checking if a next value exists, and 2) obtaining of the next value in the iteration.\\n\\nI\\'d just like to note that the type hinting for the Python version of the `NestedIterator` class (Py3 at least) isn\\'t written very well; I had to resort to peeking at the data structure of the unknown `NestedInteger` class to get an idea of what we were dealing with behind the scenes. This is a big no-no for interviews especially since it\\'s explicitly stated that the implementation of `NestedInteger` should remain unknown to us; however, this was the only way forward for me.\\n\\nI have re-written the type-hinting for `nestedList` in `__init__()` from `[NestedInteger]` to `List[NestedInteger]` (which btw makes no sense to me; why would you not wrap everything into one `NestedInteger` object and pass that to `NestedIterator` instead); hopefully this helps anyone who stumbles onto the same problem.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\nThere are many possible solutions; generator objects are unique (I think) to Python so this is the implementation I am going with. The benefit of generator objects is that **we are not required to store the entire (nested) list in memory and access it index-wise**; rather, the generator object allows us to step through each object in the iteration manually. This **saves on memory without compromising the speed at which we are able to iterate through the nested list structure**.\\n\\nFor more information on generator objects, I think [this article](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/generator) is a good start.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Implementation\\n\\n```python\\nclass NestedIterator:\\n    def __init__(self, nestedList: List[NestedInteger]):\\n        def get(currList: List[NestedInteger]) -> Generator[int, None, None]:\\n            \"\"\"\\n            Generator function to iterate through all nested NestedInteger objects and return its integer value.\\n            :param currList: The current (nested) list of NestedIntegers to iterate through.\\n            :yields:         The integer value of the current NestedInteger in the iteration.\\n            \"\"\"\\n            for nestedInteger in currList:\\n                if nestedInteger.isInteger():  # nestedInteger has a single integer value\\n                    yield nestedInteger.getInteger()\\n                else:                          # nestedInteger is a list of NestedIntegers\\n                    yield from get(nestedInteger.getList())\\n        self.generator = get(nestedList)               # Initialise the generator object with the given NestedInteger list\\n        self.nextInteger = next(self.generator, None)  # Obtain the next (first) NestedInteger pre-emptively\\n    \\n    def next(self) -> int:\\n        result = self.nextInteger                      # store the current NestedInteger integer value\\n        self.nextInteger = next(self.generator, None)  # Obtain the next NestedInteger pre-emptively\\n        return result\\n    \\n    def hasNext(self) -> bool:\\n        return self.nextInteger is not None\\n```\\n\\n**TC: O(1)** for all functions, since we are stepping through the iteration manually.\\n**SC: O(h)**, where `h` is the maximum depth of the nested list structure, due to implicit stack space used by the generator function.\\n\\n---\\n\\nPlease upvote if this has helped you!

Since there can be multiple layers of nesting, we should make **flatten** a **recursive** function.\\n\\nWith **flatten**, we should iterate through the given **list** and if the current element (**el**) is an integer we should push its contained value onto **data**, otherwise we should recursively call **flatten** on the nested list contained in **el**.\\n\\nOnce our **data** is successfully flattened, **next()** should be as easy as removing and returning the lead element of **data**.

If you like this solution or find it useful,* ***please upvote*** *this post.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Idea:***\\n\\nThis problem is fairly straightforward, as long as we pay attention to the behavior of the **NestedInteger** class.\\n\\nIt is easiest to apply our flattening method (**flatten()**) during the class construction process, so that we only ever store the flattened list (**data**) in our class instance. Since there can be multiple layers of nesting, we should make **flatten** a **recursive** function.\\n\\nWith **flatten**, we should iterate through the given **list** and if the current element (**el**) is an integer we should push its contained value onto **data**, otherwise we should recursively call **flatten** on the nested list contained in **el**.\\n\\nOnce our **data** is successfully flattened, **next()** should be as easy as removing and returning the lead element of **data**. When **data** is reduced to a length of **0**, then **hasNext()** can **return false**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Implementation:***\\n\\nThere are only minor differences between the code for all four languages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Javascript Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **96ms / 48.8MB** (beats 96% / 100%).\\n```javascript\\nclass NestedIterator {\\n    constructor(nestedList) {\\n        this.data = []\\n        this.flatten(nestedList)\\n    };\\n    \\n    flatten(list) {\\n        for (let el of list)\\n            if (el.isInteger()) this.data.push(el.getInteger())\\n            else this.flatten(el.getList())\\n    };\\n    \\n    hasNext() { return this.data.length };\\n    \\n    next() { return this.data.shift() };\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Python Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **60ms / 17.4MB** (beats 93% / 95%).\\n```python\\nclass NestedIterator:\\n    def __init__(self, nestedList: [NestedInteger]):\\n        self.data = []\\n        self.flatten(nestedList)\\n        \\n    def flatten(self, lst):\\n        for el in lst:\\n            if el.isInteger(): self.data.append(el.getInteger())\\n            else: self.flatten(el.getList())\\n    \\n    def hasNext(self) -> bool: return len(self.data)\\n    \\n    def next(self) -> int: return self.data.pop(0)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Java Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **2ms / 40.9MB** (beats 97% / 96%).\\n```java\\npublic class NestedIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {\\n    Queue<Integer> data = new LinkedList<>();\\n\\n    public NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) { \\n        flatten(nestedList);\\n    }\\n    \\n    public void flatten(List<NestedInteger> list) {\\n        for (NestedInteger el : list)\\n            if (el.isInteger()) data.add(el.getInteger());\\n            else flatten(el.getList());\\n    }\\n\\n    public Integer next() { return data.poll(); }\\n\\n    public boolean hasNext() { return data.size() > 0; }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***C++ Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **8ms / 13.9MB** (beats 99% / 51%).\\n```c++\\nclass NestedIterator {\\nqueue<int> data;\\n    \\npublic:\\n    NestedIterator(vector<NestedInteger> &nestedList) {\\n        flatten(nestedList);\\n    }\\n    \\n    void flatten(vector<NestedInteger> &list) {\\n        for (NestedInteger el : list)\\n            if (el.isInteger()) data.push(el.getInteger());\\n            else flatten(el.getList());\\n    }\\n    \\n    int next() {\\n        int res = data.front(); data.pop();\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n    \\n    bool hasNext() { return data.size() > 0; }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n\\n# Approach\\nThe NestedIterator class implements an iterator to flatten a nested list of integers. It has three methods:\\n\\n1. __init__(self, nestedList: List[NestedInteger]): Initializes the iterator with the nested list nestedList. It creates a deque to store the flattened integers, and calls the addInteger function to add integers to the deque.\\n\\n2. next(self) -> int: Returns the next integer in the nested list. It removes and returns the leftmost element from the deque using the popleft method.\\n\\n3. hasNext(self) -> bool: Returns true if there are still some integers in the nested list and false otherwise. It checks if the deque is not empty using the bool function.\\n\\n4. addInteger(self, nestedList: List[NestedInteger]) -> None: Adds integers to the deque. It takes a nested list as input, and iterates over its elements. If an element is an integer, it adds it to the deque using the append method. If an element is a list, it recursively calls the addInteger function to add integers to the deque.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n90.75%\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass NestedIterator:\\n  def __init__(self, nestedList: List[NestedInteger]):\\n    # Initialize a deque to store the flattened integers\\n    self.q = collections.deque()\\n    # Call the addInteger function to add integers to the deque\\n    self.addInteger(nestedList)\\n\\n  def next(self) -> int:\\n    # Remove and return the leftmost element from the deque\\n    return self.q.popleft()\\n\\n  def hasNext(self) -> bool:\\n    # Return True if the deque is not empty, False otherwise\\n    return bool(self.q)\\n\\n  def addInteger(self, nestedList: List[NestedInteger]) -> None:\\n    # Iterate over the elements in the nestedList\\n    for ni in nestedList:\\n      # If the element is an integer, add it to the deque\\n      if ni.isInteger():\\n        self.q.append(ni.getInteger())\\n      # If the element is a list, recursively call the addInteger function to add integers to the deque\\n      else:\\n        self.addInteger(ni.getList())\\n\\n```",

                "content": "It\\'s not necessary to pre-process the entire list and create a flatten copy of it , because the idea is to implement an iterator, this means you need to process and return the data when the user asks for them. Imagine the user instanciates the Iterator class, but he never asks if the iterator has some data (hasNext()), another situation is when you have 10 elements, but the user just gets 2 elements. That\\'s the reason I think is better to return and process on demand. This is my solution.\\n\\n```\\nclass NestedIterator:\\n    def __init__(self, nestedList: [NestedInteger]):\\n        self.__nestedList = nestedList\\n        self.__position = 0\\n        self.__lists = []\\n    \\n    def next(self) -> int:\\n        integer = self.__nestedList[self.__position].getInteger()\\n        self.__position += 1\\n        return integer\\n        \\n    \\n    def hasNext(self) -> bool:    \\n        while not self.__isComplete():\\n            currNode = self.__nestedList[self.__position]\\n            \\n            if currNode.isInteger():\\n                return True\\n            else:\\n                self.__position += 1\\n                self.__lists.append((self.__nestedList, self.__position))\\n                self.__position = 0\\n                self.__nestedList = currNode.getList()\\n            \\n        if self.__isComplete() and not self.__listEmpty():\\n            self.__nestedList, self.__position = self.__lists.pop()\\n            return self.hasNext()\\n                    \\n        return False\\n    \\n    def __listEmpty(self) -> bool:\\n        return len(self.__lists) == 0\\n    \\n    def __isComplete(self) -> bool:\\n        return self.__position >= len(self.__nestedList)\\n```",

Otherwise, it is a nested list (vector of NestedInteger), so we pop it, push to stack its elements (via `pushList`) and repeat processing the stack top.\\n3. `next()` firstly prepares next using `hasNext()` and then returns it (popping it beforehand)\\n\\n```\\nclass NestedIterator {\\n    stack<NestedInteger> s;\\npublic:\\n    NestedIterator(vector<NestedInteger> &nestedList) {\\n        pushList(nestedList);\\n    }\\n    \\n    int next() {\\n        hasNext();\\n        int res = s.top().getInteger();\\n        s.pop();\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n    \\n    bool hasNext() {\\n        while (!s.empty()) {\\n            if (s.top().isInteger()) {\\n                return true;\\n            }\\n            auto t = s.top();\\n            s.pop();\\n            pushList(t.getList());\\n        }\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n    \\n    void pushList(const vector<NestedInteger>& v) {\\n        for (int i = v.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {\\n            s.push(v[i]);\\n        }\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Special attention needs to be paid for cases like [1, [2, [] ], 3] that has empty vectors.\\n```\\nclass NestedIterator {\\nprivate:\\n    NestedInteger* p; //pointer to current element\\n    int index; // index of current element in vector\\n    int size; // size of current vector\\n    stack<NestedInteger*> pStack; // stack for p\\n    stack<int> iStack; // stack for index\\n    stack<int> sStack; // stack for size    \\npublic:\\n    NestedIterator(vector<NestedInteger> &nestedList) {\\n        index = 0;\\n        size  = nestedList.size();\\n        if(size != 0)\\n            p = &nestedList[0];\\n    }\\n\\n    int next() {\\n        int res = p -> getInteger();\\n        p++; // move to next element, maybe invalid but will be handled by hasNext()\\n        index++;\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n\\n    bool hasNext() { // move to the next(including current) node that is an integer \\n        while(index >= size || p -> isInteger() == false){ /*p -> getList().size() == 0 && p -> isInteger() == false || */ // it turns out p -> isInteger is also false if p points to empty list []\\n            if(index >= size){ // if out of current vector range \\n                if(pStack.size() == 0)\\n                    return false;\\n                p = pStack.top() + 1;\\n                index = iStack.top() + 1;\\n                size = sStack.top();\\n                pStack.pop();\\n                iStack.pop();\\n                sStack.pop();\\n            }else if(p -> getList().size() == 0){// if current p is empty, go to next element in current vector\\n                p++;\\n                index++;\\n            }else{// p is not integer, go to next level\\n                pStack.push(p);\\n                iStack.push(index);\\n                sStack.push(size);\\n                size = p -> getList().size();\\n                p = &(p -> getList()[0]); //vector head addr;\\n                index = 0;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```",

For them we are going to use Java in-built iterator class and its function. \\n**Approach:** After flattenting nestedList and creating \"res\" (i.e result after flattening of list), just convert the res to iterartor and functions of iterator i.e hasNext() and next() will take care of rest.\\n**Code of the discussed Approach:**\\n```\\npublic class NestedIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {\\n    List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();\\n    Iterator<Integer> it;\\n    public NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) {\\n        \\n        flatting(nestedList, res);\\n        it = res.iterator();\\n    }\\n    private List<Integer> flatting(List<NestedInteger> nestedList, List<Integer> res)\\n    {\\n        for(int i =0;i<nestedList.size();i++)\\n        {\\n            if(nestedList.get(i).isInteger())\\n            {\\n                res.add(nestedList.get(i).getInteger());\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                flatting(nestedList.get(i).getList() , res);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n    @Override\\n    public Integer next() {\\n         return it.next();\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public boolean hasNext() {\\n     return it.hasNext();   \\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\n",

(lazy loading of inner lists)\\n2) Initially at beginning traverse the whole list and by recursive call convert nested list into flat list. (eager loading of inner lists)\\n\\nThere are total 3 methods:\\n1) next() which returns element on top of data structure it should always be integer. \\n2) hasNext() which will check is there any element exist which is pending to traverse, there is possibility that list is empty or list can have inner list inside that like [[], [3]] , [[[[5]]]]. Hence to overcome such scenarios we need while loop there which will check and retrieve the element for the nested lists. \\n3) initStack(): which is helper method, which helps in retriving values from nested list all at once if we follow recursive (eager) method, or current/next element of the list if we follow lazy loading.\\n\\nNote: Methods isInteger(), getInteger() and getList() implementation already exist in custom class provided in method definition NestedInteger.\\n\\n```\\n    class NestedIterator:\\n\\n        def initStack(self,nestedList):\\n\\n            for ele in (nestedList):\\n                if ele.isInteger():\\n                    #print(nestedList[i].getInteger())\\n                    self.stack.append(ele)\\n                else:\\n                    #print(nestedList[i].getList())\\n                    self.stack.extend(ele.getList()[::-1])\\n\\n        def __init__(self, nestedList: [NestedInteger]):\\n            self.currentList = nestedList\\n            self.stack = []\\n            self.initStack(self.currentList[::-1])\\n\\n\\n        def next(self) -> int:\\n            return self.stack.pop()\\n\\n        def hasNext(self) -> bool:\\n            while self.stack:\\n                if self.stack[-1].isInteger():\\n                    return True\\n\\n                self.initStack(self.stack.pop().getList()[::-1])\\n\\n            return False\\n```",
