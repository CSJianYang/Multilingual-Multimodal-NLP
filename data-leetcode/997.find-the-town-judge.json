                "content": "**Claim 1** ---- There can be only one judge satisfying the conditions 1 and 2. The third statement ***There must be only one person satisfying the above 2 criteria*** is a red-herring.\\n\\n**Proof** ------ Suppose there are actually 2 judges satisfying criteria `1` and `2`. It implies that judge 1 does not trust anybody, It means that the maximum number of trust any other person can have is equal to `(n-2)` [Since a person trusting himself is not being counted]. This implies that person 2 cannot be a judge, as trust count of person 2 can never be equal to `(n-1)`. Hence, we have a contradiction. \\n\\n\\nSo now, we only have to worry about finding out a single judge without worrying about *false positives*.\\n\\n\\nTo accomplish this we make an array `trustCount` which stores the number of person who trust the `i-th` person at the `i-th` index.\\nFurther, we also maintain a *boolean* array `trusts_Some_One` which stores ***true*** at the `i-th` position if the `i-th` person trusts someone.\\n\\nNow we traverse each person and check if `(n-1)` people trust him or not. If yes, we also confirm that he does not trust anybody. If both criteria is met, we terminate immediately as there can be only a sinlge judge.\\n\\n**Miscellaneous** ----- \\n1) The persons are numbered from `1` to `n`. Hence the `0-th` element of the array is never accessed. \\n2) While updating, we traverse the trust vector, and for each entry of the form `[a,b]`, we call `a` as the **currentPerson** and `b` as the **secondPerson**, implying that the first person trusts the second person. Hence we update the counts accordingly.\\n\\n```\\n/* Returns the identity of the town judge, else returns -1 */\\nint Solution :: findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust)\\n{\\n    /* trustCount[i] denotes the number of people who trust the i\\'th person */\\n    vector<int> trustCount(n+1);\\n    \\n    /* trusts_Some_one[i] is true if the i\\'th person trusts any other person */\\n    vector<bool> trusts_Some_one(n+1);\\n    \\n    // Traverse the trust vector and update trust count and trusts_Some_one\\n    for(auto row_vec:trust)\\n    {\\n        // The current person trusts the next person\\n        int currentPerson = row_vec[0];\\n        int nextPerson = row_vec[1];\\n        \\n        // The currentPerson trusts the next person, so he does trust some one \\n        trusts_Some_one[currentPerson] = true;\\n        \\n        // The current person trusts the next person, so increase the trust count of the next person\\n        trustCount[nextPerson] ++;\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Traverse each person and check if he is suitable for judge or not\\n    for(int person=1; person<=n; person++)\\n        if(trustCount[person] == (n-1) && trusts_Some_one[person]==false)\\n                return person;\\n    \\n    // If it reaches here, it means no person can be a judge, return -1 */\\n    return -1;\\n}\\n```",

The town judge trusts nobody.\\n2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.\\n3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.\\n\\nSince the problem deals with defining relationships between different entities a graph data structure is a good choice. If a person ```A```  trust a person ```B``` , it does not always mean that person ```B``` also trusts person ```A```.  \\n\\nThus it is best to represent the relationship of trust between people as directed graph. trust is only guaranteed one way. ```A -> B``` \\n\\n\\nThe diagram below reads\\n* ```A``` places trust in ```B```\\n* ```B``` places trust in no one \\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/49b8dc8a-cdf8-4a59-afd6-d60a523954d9_1609386097.5714333.png)\\n\\n\\nin graph theory a directed edge is formally defined as an edge with an orientation meaning, it has direction that must be followed. ```A->B``` is a directed edge. \\n\\nObserve ```A``` has an outgoing connection and ```B``` has an incoming connection. \\n\\nMore formally we say ```A```  has an ***outdegree***  (number of outoging connections) of ```1``` and ```B``` has an ***indegree*** (number of incoming connections) of ```1``` \\n\\nAlso note ```A``` has an ***indegree*** of ```0``` and ```B``` has an ***outdegree*** of ```0```.\\n\\nThus we can define trust realtionships via ***indegrees*** and ***outdegrees***\\n\\n* The ***indegree*** value for a person ```P```  represents the number of people who trust person ```P```\\n*  The ***outdegree*** value for a person ```P```  represents the number of people person ```P``` trusts \\n\\nobserve the following examples \\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/2c9e667f-cbba-4ced-a8ec-44c91056e185_1609386431.2723234.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nthe key observation to solving this problem is to recognize that \\n* everyone trusts the judge (except the judge) means the judge has an indegree of ```N - 1``` \\n* the judge trusts no one means the judge has an outdegree of ```0```\\n* will only ever be ```1``` person with this property means the first vertex (person) we find with the above properties is the judge\\n\\nThus all that must be done is to calculate the indegrees and outdegrees for all vertices and find the vertice with an indegree ```N -1``` and outdegree of ```0```. like in **figures 2 & 3*** \\n\\nif no vertex exist with these indegree and outdegree values then no judge is present and ```-1``` is returned like in ***Figure 4***\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Keep an `freq` integer array to count the number of people that trusts a particular person.\\n2. Have a HashSet `trustSet` which will hold the all the people who trust someone or the other.\\n3. Now iterate from `1` to `n` and check `if(freq[i] == n-1 && !trustSet.contains(i))` i.e. the `i`th person is trusted by all and the `i`th person trusts no one.\\n4. Edge case: If `n == 1`, that would mean `trust = [[]]`, hence return 1\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {\\n        if(n == 1) return 1;\\n\\n        int[] freq = new int[n+1];\\n        Set<Integer> trustSet = new HashSet<>();\\n\\n        for(int i=0; i<trust.length; i++){\\n            trustSet.add(trust[i][0]);\\n            freq[trust[i][1]] += 1;\\n        }\\n        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){\\n            if(freq[i] == n-1 && !trustSet.contains(i)) return i;\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Single Array Approach\\n1. In this appraoch we just keep a single integer array `freq`. \\n2. If we have `trust[i] = [a,b]` we simple increment `freq[b]` by 1 and decrement `freq[a]` by 1.\\n3. This would make sure that if `i`th person is trusted by all and also if that person trusts no one then `freq[i] == n-1`.\\n4. So Just iterate over the array and check if frequency of any element is `n-1`.\\n5. Edge case: If `n == 1`, that would mean `trust = [[]]`, hence return 1\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {\\n        if(n == 1) return 1;\\n        int[] freq = new int[n+1];\\n        for(int i=0; i<trust.length; i++){\\n            freq[trust[i][0]] -= 1;\\n            freq[trust[i][1]] += 1;\\n        }\\n        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){\\n            if(freq[i] == n-1) return i;\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n}\\n``` \\n\\n##### Time complexity: O(N)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n### Please do Upvote if this helped you",

                "content": "This is a nice warmup problem, and also a graph problem in disguise, if you wish: we are hunting for a single node which has indegree equal to `n - 1` and `0` outdegree.\\n\\nIn order to solve it efficiently, anyway, we only need to take into account the overall number of indegrees and if each node has outdegrees or not, so we can optimise a bit in that sense too.\\n\\nWe will create a few support variables to help us first:\\n* `trusted` will store our indegrees, increasing `n` since we will have to include that element too;\\n* `trusting` will  be our outdegrees store and since we just need to know if a node trusts others or not, we can have it as a boolean.\\n\\nAfter initialising them to be all `0`s and `false`s respectivevly, we can parse `trust` to populate them and for each element, update `trusted` and `trusting` to mark the information we store in them.\\n\\nWe can now start parsing all the elements in our stores going with `i` from `1` (since we were given `1`-indexed nodes in this problem) up to `n` and as soon as we find an element with no outdegrees (`!trusting[i]`), we will check if the same node also has a number of indegrees equal to `target` (which in turn equals `n -2`, since we have to remove the previous increase to the value of `n` and of course one of the node, not trusting itself) and have two scenarios:\\n* the same node has indeed `target` indegrees, so it means it matches our condition and we can just `return` `i`;\\n* alternatively, we know that no other element can have `target` indegrees (since all the connections in `trust` are stated to be uniques, so no repetitions will be given) and this also means that no other valid element can have `0` outdegrees, so we can confidently `return` `-1`.\\n\\nIf we leave the loop for any other reason (ie: no node actually had `target` connections), we can similarly be sure that there is no judge and `return` `-1`.\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {\\n        // support variables\\n        int trusted[++n];\\n        bool trusting[n];\\n        fill(trusted, trusted + n, 0);\\n        fill(trusting, trusting + n, false);\\n        // populating trusted and trusting\\n        for (auto &e: trust) {\\n            trusted[e[1]]++;\\n            trusting[e[0]] = true;\\n        }\\n       // hunting for the one trusting no one\\n        for (int i = 1, target = n - 2; i < n; i++) {\\n            if (!trusting[i]) {\\n                if (trusted[i] == target) {\\n                    return i;\\n                }\\n                return -1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nCan we do better? Well, yes - if we store the node that first reaches the value of `target` in the first pass, we can avoid the last loop altogether; I also tried to use a `bitset` for `trusting`, but that did not improve performance (possibly slowing it down a bit for our relatively small numbers), so I reverted it to a `bool` array.\\n\\nThe updated code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {\\n        // edge case - empty trust\\n        if (!trust.size()) return n == 1 ? 1 : -1;\\n        // support variables\\n        int trusted[++n], res = 0, target = n - 2;\\n        bool trusting[n];\\n        fill(trusted, trusted + n, 0);\\n        fill(trusting, trusting + n, false);\\n        // populating trusted and trusting\\n        for (auto &e: trust) {\\n            // storing the first match we find in res\\n            if (++trusted[e[1]] == target) res = e[1];\\n            trusting[e[0]] = true;\\n            \\n        }\\n        return !res || trusting[res] ? -1 : res;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThe brag:\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b0e3c3be-6737-4f18-a8c1-82172c045ce2_1641206300.7861629.png)\\n",

In this case, it would be from 1 to n (both inclusive). This list is called the `judge_list` and is a 2d array. The first index consisting the judge value as mentioned earlier and the second index is initialized as 0.\\n2. We the run a loop to iterate through the `trust` list provided to us. While iterating through each element, we add 1 to which ever value is in the first index and we subtract which ever value is in the second index.\\n3. This a dynamic approach to keep track of all the values in the `judge_list`.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThere are three loops used. So, the time complexity would be:\\nO(n+n+n) = O(3n) = O(n)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe program uses constant space.

Consider every people as node and trust[i] = \n    [ai, bi] as a directed edge from ai to bi.\n3. Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7. If there is no node having indegree = n - 1 \n    and outdegree 0 return -1;\n\nPlease upvote if you are able to understand the logic by following these steps. if you have any doubts feel free to comment.\n\nThanks :)"

Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7.

Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6.

Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7.

Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7.

Consider every people as node and trust[i] = \n    [ai, bi] as a directed edge from ai to bi.\n3. Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7. If there is no node having indegree = n - 1 \n    and outdegree 0 return -1;\n\nPlease upvote if you are able to understand the logic by following these steps. if you have any doubts feel free to comment.\n\nThanks :)"

Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7.

But it\\'s definitely a test of whether you can think of and anticipate adverse test cases. \\n\\nBut if you can anticipate them all and get this in one try, yeah, well done, that\\'s definitely not easy.

Consider every people as node and trust[i] = \n    [ai, bi] as a directed edge from ai to bi.\n3. Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7. If there is no node having indegree = n - 1 \n    and outdegree 0 return -1;\n\nPlease upvote if you are able to understand the logic by following these steps. if you have any doubts feel free to comment.\n\nThanks :)"

Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7.

Consider every people as node and trust[i] = \n    [ai, bi] as a directed edge from ai to bi.\n3. Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7.

Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7.

Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6.

Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7.

Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6.

Consider every people as node and trust[i] = \n    [ai, bi] as a directed edge from ai to bi.\n3. Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7. If there is no node having indegree = n - 1 \n    and outdegree 0 return -1;\n\nPlease upvote if you are able to understand the logic by following these steps. if you have any doubts feel free to comment.\n\nThanks :)"

Create two vectors named indegree and \n    outdegree of size n for storing the indegree \n    and outdegree for every node.\n4. Iterate the trust vector and for every [ai, bi] \n    increment indegree[bi] by 1 and outdegree of \n    ai by 1. \n5. After traversing the entire trust vector you \n    have to find the node which has outdegree 0 \n    and indegree = (n - 1) and return that node as \n    answer. \n6. Since it's mentioned in the question \n    that if possible there will be only one people \n    who satisfies both the properties, so there \n    will be only one node having indegree = n - 1 \n    && outdegree = 0.  \n7.

The main argument against making it a medium problem is that it doesn\\'t really require any of the more advanced concepts in dynamic programming, backtracking, tree traversal, divide and conquer, and so forth. The programming required to solve this is pretty straightforward. But it\\'s definitely a test of whether you can think of and anticipate adverse test cases. \\n\\nBut if you can anticipate them all and get this in one try, yeah, well done, that\\'s definitely not easy.
