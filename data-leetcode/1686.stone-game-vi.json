                "content": "# Intuition:\\nThe Intuition is to check if it is possible to swap two characters in string `s` to make it equal to string `goal`. It first handles the case where `s` and `goal` are identical by checking for duplicate characters. If they are not identical, it looks for the first pair of mismatched characters and tries swapping them to achieve equality. The code provides a solution by considering these two scenarios and returns `true` if swapping is successful, otherwise `false`.\\n\\n# Explanation:\\n1. First, it checks if `s` is equal to `goal` using the `==` operator. If they are equal, it means the strings are identical.\\n\\n2. If `s` is equal to `goal`, the code creates a temporary set called `temp` to store the unique characters present in `s`. It does this by converting the string `s` to a set of characters using the `set` constructor.\\n\\n3. The code then returns the result of the comparison `temp.size() < goal.size()`. This comparison checks if the size of the set `temp` (number of unique characters in `s`) is less than the size of the string `goal`. If it is, it means there are duplicate characters in `s`, and swapping any two of them would result in `s` becoming equal to `goal`. In this case, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\\n\\n4. If `s` is not equal to `goal`, the code proceeds to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `s[i]` and `goal[i]` are the first pair of characters that are different from each other when scanning from the left, and `s[j]` and `goal[j]` are the first pair of characters that are different from each other when scanning from the right.\\n5. The code uses a `while` loop to increment the `i` index from left to right until it finds a mismatch between `s[i]` and `goal[i]`. Similarly, it uses another `while` loop to decrement the `j` index from right to left until it finds a mismatch between `s[j]` and `goal[j]`.\\n6. After finding the mismatched indices, the code checks if `i` is less than `j`. If it is, it means there is a pair of characters that can be swapped to make `s` equal to `goal`. In this case, the code uses the `swap` function to swap the characters `s[i]` and `s[j]`.\\n\\n7. Finally, the code checks if `s` is equal to `goal` after the potential swap. If they are equal, it means we have successfully swapped two characters to make `s` equal to `goal`, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\\n\\n# Code\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool buddyStrings(string s, string goal) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        \\n        if(goal.length() != n){\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n\\n        if(s == goal){\\n            set<char> temp(s.begin(), s.end());\\n            return temp.size() < goal.size(); // Swapping same characters\\n        }\\n\\n        int i = 0;\\n        int j = n - 1;\\n\\n        while(i < j && s[i] == goal[i]){\\n            i++;\\n        }\\n\\n        while(j >= 0 && s[j] == goal[j]){\\n            j--;\\n        }\\n\\n        if(i < j){\\n            swap(s[i], s[j]);\\n        }\\n\\n        return s == goal;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean buddyStrings(String s, String goal) {\\n        if(s.length() != goal.length()){\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        if (s.equals(goal)) {\\n            Set<Character> temp = new HashSet<>();\\n            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {\\n                temp.add(c);\\n            }\\n            return temp.size() < goal.length(); // Swapping same characters\\n        }\\n\\n        int i = 0;\\n        int j = n - 1;\\n\\n        while (i < j && s.charAt(i) == goal.charAt(i)) {\\n            i++;\\n        }\\n\\n        while (j >= 0 && s.charAt(j) == goal.charAt(j)) {\\n            j--;\\n        }\\n\\n        if (i < j) {\\n            char[] sArr = s.toCharArray();\\n            char temp = sArr[i];\\n            sArr[i] = sArr[j];\\n            sArr[j] = temp;\\n            s = new String(sArr);\\n        }\\n\\n        return s.equals(goal);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```Python3 []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def buddyStrings(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:\\n        n = len(s)\\n\\n        if len(goal) != n:\\n            return False;\\n\\n        if s == goal:\\n            temp = set(s)\\n            return len(temp) < len(goal)  # Swapping same characters\\n\\n        i = 0\\n        j = n - 1\\n\\n        while i < j and s[i] == goal[i]:\\n            i += 1\\n\\n        while j >= 0 and s[j] == goal[j]:\\n            j -= 1\\n\\n        if i < j:\\n            s_list = list(s)\\n            s_list[i], s_list[j] = s_list[j], s_list[i]\\n            s = \\'\\'.join(s_list)\\n\\n        return s == goal\\n```\\n\\n![CUTE_CAT.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/afc18472-664c-4d6e-8370-25d5a4565caf_1688345134.3503385.png)\\n\\n\\n**If you found my solution helpful, I would greatly appreciate your upvote, as it would motivate me to continue sharing more solutions.**",

So, if number of not equal symbols is not `0` or `2`, we return `False`.\\n4. Also, if we have number `diff_places == 0`, it means that we changed two equal symbols. We can not do it if all string has different symbols, like `abtlpe`, so we return `False` in this case.\\n5. If we have `diff_places == 2`, it means that we changed two different symbols. We can not do it if string is just one symbols repeated, like `ddddddd`, so we return `False` in this case.\\n6.

                "content": "\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe approach of the code is as follows:\\n\\n1. First, the code checks if the lengths of the two input strings, `s` and `goal`, are not equal or if the length of `s` is less than or equal to 1. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns `false`. This is because for the two strings to be buddy strings, they must have the same length and contain at least two differing characters.\\n\\n2. Next, the code checks if `s` and `goal` are identical. If they are, it means that all characters are the same. In this case, the code creates an set, `distinctChars`, to store the distinct characters from `s`. If the size of `distinctChars` is less than the length of `s`, it means there are duplicate characters, and we can swap two of them to make `s` and `goal` equal. The function returns `true` in this case.\\n\\n3. If the previous conditions are not met, it means that `s` and `goal` are different strings, and we need to check if they can be made equal by swapping exactly two characters.\\n\\n4. The code iterates through each character of `s` and `goal` simultaneously, comparing the characters at each index. Whenever a pair of characters at the same index is different, the index is added to the `index` vector.\\n\\n5. After iterating through both strings, the code checks if the size of `index` is exactly 2. If it\\'s not, it means there are either more or fewer than two differing characters, and the strings cannot be made equal by swapping two characters. In this case, the function returns `false`.\\n\\n6. If there are exactly two differing characters, the code proceeds to swap these characters in `s` by using the indices stored in the `index` vector.\\n\\n7. Finally, the code checks if `s` is now equal to `goal` after the swap. If they are equal, it means that `s` and `goal` can be made equal by swapping two characters, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it means the swap did not result in `s` becoming equal to `goal`, and the function returns `false`.\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:    $$O(n)$$\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool buddyStrings(string s, string goal) {\\n        if (s.length() != goal.length() || s.length() <= 1) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n\\n        if (s == goal) {\\n            unordered_set<char> distinctChars(s.begin(), s.end());\\n            return distinctChars.size() < s.length();\\n        }\\n\\n        vector<int> index;\\n        for (int i=0;i<s.length();i++) {\\n            if (s[i] != goal[i]) {\\n                index.push_back(i);\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        if (index.size() != 2) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n\\n        swap(s[index[0]], s[index[1]]);\\n        return s == goal;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```",

We\\'re limited to swapping two characters exactly one time, so this is out of our scope and results in immediate failure. O(1) time and space.\\n\\n#2: A simple run through the array, marking how many differences we encounter along the way. We do this because it is only possible to return \"true\" if there are either **two differences or no differences**. If there is only one difference, then every character is the same between both strings at every index except for one; moving the character at this index to some other index would ruin the equality of the target index, so it is impossible to do. We\\'re only allowed to swap two characters, so obviously if there are three or more differences we have no shot of making them equal. O(N) time, O(1) space.\\n*(06-26-18 update) Additionally, I save two numbers in a 2-array called \"differentIndices\" - as you might expect, this is where I save the indices where A and B differ. This is still O(1) space because the size of the array doesn\\'t depend on any variable - it\\'s always size 2. The reason I only worry about two indices is because, like I said, we\\'ll return false if there are more than two differences anyway.*\\n\\n#3: **(UPDATED 06-26-2018)** Previously, I checked `set(A) == set(B)` here - however, user MonnaGotIt mentioned that `A = \"abcaa\"` and `B = \"abcbb\"` would incorrectly return true at this juncture, so it needed to be changed. Instead, I take the two indices I recorded earlier (both will be initialized to something other than -1 since `differences` is equal to 2 here), and I make sure the characters would be equal if they were swapped. It\\'s not sufficient to just check `A[differentIndices[0]] == B[differentIndices[1]]` or `B[differentIndices[0]] == A[differentIndices[1]]`, because then `A = \"abcab\"` and `B = \"abcbb\"` would incorrectly return true. They must both be checked. O(1) time, O(1) space.\\n`set(A) == set(B)` is what I had before, and it was O(N) time and O(1) space. More specifically, it was O(3N) time - O(N) to make a set out of A, O(N) to make a set out of B, and O(N) to compare the two in the worst case. Thanks to MonnaGotIt for pointing out the issue with this line.\\n\\n#4: Finally, if there are no differences between A and B (the strings are equal), we can only return true if there\\'s at least one character in A and B that repeats at least once. It doesn\\'t matter how many times it repeats or how many characters repeat, but we need to be able to make a meaningless change if we return true. For example, in `A = B = \\'aabacd\\'`, we can swap any of the two \\'a\\' and return true. However, in `A = B = abcd`, swapping any character would result in the strings losing their equality, so we return false. We check this by comparing the length of set(A) and A: like I said before, converting A to a set will remove all duplicate elements. Therefore, if any duplicate element exists in A, the length of set(A) will be less than the length of A. In this case, we return true. If they\\'re equal, then there were no duplicates in A whatsoever, and we return false. O(N) time, O(N) space.\\n\\nThat\\'s about the size of it.

They are off by exactly 2 same characters:\\n\\n```\\n            if set(a)==set(b):\\n                if len(a) == len(b) == 2:\\n                    return True\\n```\\n\\nThen we can simply swap those 2 characters.\\n\\n2. The strings are completely identical. Then we need to make sure those string have at least 2 instances of some character so they can be swapped (for example \"aa\" and \"aa\", while swapping first a and second a don\\'t change the string, they can still be swapped). So we find the most common character and make sure it\\'s the same and there is more than one in each string:\\n```\\n                else:\\n                    ca,cb = collections.Counter(A), collections.Counter(B)\\n                    if A==B  and cb.most_common(1)[0][1]>1:\\n                        return True\\n```\\n\\nOtherwise - return False.\\n\\n",

If they have different lengths, we immediately returns False. \\n- Then we checks if $$s$$ and $$goal$$ are identical and $$s$$ has a character that appears more than once. If both conditions are met, we returns $$True$$. \\n- Otherwise, using zip function, we creates a list of pairs of characters where $$s$$ and $$goal$$ differ. If the length of the list is 2 and the pairs are reversed versions of each other, we returns $$True$$.

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->Upon initial analysis of the code, here are my thoughts on how to solve the problem:\\n\\n1. The function `buddyStrings` takes two strings, `s` and `goal`, and determines if it is possible to swap two characters in `s` to make it equal to `goal`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether this is possible.\\n\\n2. The first condition checks if the sizes of `s` and `goal` are different or if the size is 1. If either of these conditions is true, it immediately returns `false` because it is not possible to swap characters in these cases.\\n\\n3. The code uses two vectors, `different` and `ct`. The `different` vector stores the indices where the characters in `s` and `goal` are different. The `ct` vector is used to count the occurrences of each character in `s`.\\n\\n4. The loop iterates over each character in `s` and checks if it is different from the corresponding character in `goal`. If they are different, the index is added to the `different` vector. Otherwise, the count of that character in `s` is incremented in the `ct` vector. If a character occurs more than or equal to twice, the flag `f` is set to true.\\n\\n5. After the loop, several conditions are checked:\\n\\n   - If there are more than 2 different characters, it is not possible to swap two characters to make `s` equal to `goal`. In this case, the function returns `false`.\\n   - If there is only 1 different character, it is also not possible to perform the swap. The function returns `false`.\\n   - If there are no different characters (`different.size() == 0`), the function returns the value of `f`, which indicates whether there are duplicate characters in `s`.\\n\\n6. If the code reaches this point, it means there are exactly 2 different characters in `s`. The code swaps these characters in `s` using the indices stored in `different`.\\n\\n7. Finally, the code checks if the swapped string `s` is equal to `goal`. If they are equal, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\\n\\nThese are my initial thoughts on how the code solves the problem.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->Based on the provided code, the approach to solving the problem can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n1. The initial checks ensure that the sizes of the input strings are compatible for swapping characters and that they are not trivial cases where swapping is not possible.\\n\\n2. The code iterates through each character of the strings `s` and `goal`. It identifies the indices where the characters differ and stores them in the `different` vector. Additionally, it keeps track of the count of each character in `s` using the `ct` vector and sets the flag `f` if any character occurs more than or equal to twice.\\n\\n3. After the loop, several conditions are checked to determine if swapping is possible or not. If there are more than 2 different characters or if there is only 1 different character, it is not possible to perform the swap, and the function returns `false`. If there are no different characters, the function returns the value of the `f` flag, indicating whether there are duplicate characters in `s`.\\n\\n4. If there are exactly 2 different characters, the code swaps these characters in `s` using the indices stored in the `different` vector.\\n\\n5. Finally, the code checks if the swapped string `s` is equal to the `goal` string. If they are equal, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\\n\\nOverall, the approach involves identifying the differences between the input strings, handling various edge cases, and determining if the strings can be made equal by swapping two characters.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool buddyStrings(string s, string goal) {\\n        // Check if the sizes of the strings are different or if the size is 1\\n        // In such cases, it\\'s not possible to swap characters to make the strings equal\\n        if (s.size() != goal.size() || s.size() == 1)\\n            return false;\\n        \\n        vector<int> different; // Store the indices where the characters are different\\n        vector<int> ct(26, 0); // Store the count of each character in string s\\n        bool f = false; // Flag to check if there are duplicate characters in string s\\n        \\n        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {\\n            if (s[i] != goal[i])\\n                different.push_back(i); // Add index to the different vector\\n            else {\\n                ct[s[i] - \\'a\\']++; // Increment the count of character s[i]\\n                if (ct[s[i] - \\'a\\'] >= 2)\\n                    f = true; // Set flag to true if character s[i] is repeated\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        if (different.size() > 2)\\n            return false; // If there are more than 2 different characters, swapping is not possible\\n        \\n        if (different.size() == 1)\\n            return false; // If there is only 1 different character, swapping is not possible\\n        \\n        if (different.size() == 0)\\n            return f; // If there are no different characters, return whether there are duplicate characters\\n        \\n        // There are exactly 2 different characters, so swap them in string s\\n        int in1, in2;\\n        in1 = different[0];\\n        in2 = different[1];\\n        swap(s[in1], s[in2]);\\n        \\n        // Check if the swapped string is equal to the goal string\\n        return s == goal;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```\\n![Leetcode.jpeg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/7ab32acb-7f72-480e-817d-8eb12f49e71b_1688358519.6356623.jpeg)\\n",

There are two scenarios where this is possible: \\n1. The strings are already equal, and there is at least one character that occurs more than once (so that we can swap it with itself).\\n2. The strings have exactly two characters at different positions, and swapping them makes the strings equal.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. If the lengths of `s` and `goal` are different, we can immediately return `False` because it\\'s impossible for them to be equal.\\n2. If `s` is equal to `goal`, check if there is at least one character that occurs more than once in `s`. If so, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\\n3. If `s` is not equal to `goal`, iterate through the characters in `s` and `goal` and keep track of the indices where the characters are different.\\n4. If there are exactly two indices where the characters are different, check if swapping the characters at these indices in `s` would make `s` equal to `goal`. If so, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input strings. This is because we iterate through each character in the strings once.\\n- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, because the extra space used by the `diff_indices` list is constant (it can have at most 2 elements) and the set creation in the case where `s` is equal to `goal` also takes constant space.\\n\\n# Code\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def buddyStrings(self, s, goal):\\n        if len(s) != len(goal):\\n            return False\\n        \\n        if s == goal:\\n            return len(set(s)) < len(s)\\n        \\n        diff_indices = []\\n        for i in range(len(s)):\\n            if s[i] != goal[i]:\\n                diff_indices.append(i)\\n                if len(diff_indices) > 2:\\n                    return False\\n        \\n        return len(diff_indices) == 2 and s[diff_indices[0]] == goal[diff_indices[1]] and s[diff_indices[1]] == goal[diff_indices[0]]\\n```",

If the characters can be swapped successfully, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.\\n\\n# Edge Cases\\nThe solution handles the following edge cases:\\n- If `s` and `goal` have lengths that are not equal, the function returns `false` immediately.\\n- If `s` and `goal` have lengths less than 2, the function returns `false` since we need at least two differing characters to swap.\\n- If `s` is equal to `goal`, the function checks if there are duplicate characters in `s` and returns `true` if there are since we can swap two occurrences of the same character.\\n\\n# Algorithm\\n1. Check the lengths of `s` and `goal` and return `false` if they are not equal or if the length is less than 2.\\n2. If `s` is equal to `goal`, convert `s` to a set and return `true` if the size of the set is smaller than the length of `s`.\\n3. Initialize an array `diffIndices` of size 2 to store the indices of the differing characters.\\n4. Iterate through the characters of `s` and `goal` simultaneously.\\n    - If the characters at the current index differ, store the index in `diffIndices` and increment `diffCount`.\\n    - If `diffCount` exceeds 2, return `false`.\\n5. If `diffCount` is not equal to 2, return `false`.\\n6. Get the values at indices 0 and 1 from `diffIndices` as `index1` and `index2`.\\n7. Return `true` if swapping the characters at `index1` and `index2` in `s` would make it equal to `goal`; otherwise, return `false`.\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n**Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$\\nThe time complexity of this solution is $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the input strings `s` and `goal`. This is because we iterate through the strings once to find differing characters and perform constant-time operations for comparisons.\\n\\n**Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$\\nThe space complexity is $$O(1)$$ since we use a fixed-size array and a constant amount of extra space for variables.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    fun buddyStrings(s: String, goal: String): Boolean {\\n        if (s.length != goal.length || s.length < 2) {\\n            return false\\n        }\\n\\n        if (s == goal) {\\n            val charSet = s.toSet()\\n            return charSet.size < s.length\\n        }\\n\\n        val diffIndices = IntArray(2)\\n        var diffCount = 0\\n\\n        for (i in s.indices) {\\n            if (s[i] != goal[i]) {\\n                if (diffCount >= 2) {\\n                    return false\\n                }\\n                diffIndices[diffCount] = i\\n                diffCount++\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        if (diffCount != 2) {\\n            return false\\n        }\\n\\n        val (index1, index2) = diffIndices\\n\\n        return s[index1] == goal[index2] && s[index2] == goal[index1]\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n# Conclusion:\\nThe solution uses a systematic approach to determine if two strings can be made equal by swapping two characters. It handles different cases efficiently and has a linear time complexity. By following the provided algorithm and code, the `buddyStrings` problem can be solved effectively.\\n\\n\\n## \\uD83D\\uDC4D Please upvote this solution on LeetCode if you found it helpful! \\uD83D\\uDE4C\\uD83D\\uDCAF\\uD83D\\uDD25",

                "content": "# Explanation\\n\\nIt is a straight forward problem. This problem only has three cases:\\n\\n1. If the `lengths` of the strings are `unequal`, answer is `no`.\\n2. If the strings are already `equal` and all the `characters` are `unique` then answer is `no`, otherwise it is `yes`.\\n3. If the strings are `not equal` then we just have to check they `differ` at `exactly two indices` `i` and `j` such that :\\n\\n                    s[i] == goal[j] and s[j] == goal[i]\\n\\n    if this is `true`, answer is `yes` otherwise answer is `no`.\\n\\n\\nWe can use `bit masking` to check the above conditions efficiently without need of frequency array. Here is how :\\n\\n1. For checking if all characters are unique or not, we can take an `integer` and assign its `bits` to each `character`. We can assign the $1_{st}$ bit of the integer to `a`, the $2_{nd}$ bit to `b` and so on. If while assigning, if a bit was already set, this implies that we have found a duplicate.\\n\\n2. For checking the swap condition mentioned above, we can take `two integer`, one for string `s` and other for string `goal`. Also, we will need a `count` variable. Whenever the characters of both strings are `unequal` at an `index`, `increment` the `count` and also `set` the `bit` corresponding to the `characters` in the respective `integers`. Then we just have to check the `XOR` of these two integers. If it is `0` then answer is `yes`, else it is `no`.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $O(n)$\\n\\n- Space complexity: $O(1)$\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean buddyStrings(String s, String goal) {\\n        if(s.length() != goal.length()) return false;\\n        if(s.equals(goal)) {\\n            int mask = 0;\\n            for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i ++) {\\n                int ind = 1 << (s.charAt(i) - \\'a\\');\\n                if((mask & ind) != 0) return true;\\n                mask |= ind;\\n            }\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        int ct = 0;\\n        int mask1 = 0;\\n        int mask2 = 0;\\n        for(int i = 0; i < goal.length(); i ++) {\\n            if(goal.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i)) {\\n                ct ++;\\n                int ind = 1 << (s.charAt(i) - \\'a\\');\\n                if((mask1 & ind) != 0) return false;\\n                mask1 += ind;\\n                ind = 1 << (goal.charAt(i) - \\'a\\');\\n                if((mask2 & ind) != 0) return false;\\n                mask2 += ind;\\n            }\\n            if(ct > 2) return false;\\n        }\\n        if(ct != 2) return false;\\n        return (mask1 ^ mask2) == 0;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

                "content": "Hello **Tenno Leetcoders**,\\n\\nFor this problem, we are given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` if you can swap `two letters` in `s` so the result is `equal` to `goal`, otherwise, return `false`.\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\nThe problem wants us to determine whether it is possible to swap two letters in string `s` such that it will become equal to string `goal`. \\n\\nThere are three base cases we need to consider:\\n\\n 1) If the length of s and goal string are not equal, we can immediately return False/false as this will be impossible to make two unique strings equal by swapping their character\\n       \\n  2) If s is already equal to goal, like in example 2. We need to check if at least one character appears more than once in s That is because swapping two identical strings will not change their values. Therefore, we will be using Hashset to help us to compare the length of set characters in s with the length of s. If length of this set is less than the length of s, then there is at least one character that appears more than once in s.\\n  \\n      - Once we find at least one repeating character in s, it will return True/true as we can still perform a swap by choosing any two occurrences of the repeated characters. The result of s will remain the same, but it will satisfy the condition of being able to swap two letters\\n      \\n      - If there are no repeating characters is s, it will return False/false as it will be impossible to make a non-repeated string any different from itself by swapping the two letters \\n       \\n  3) Next we check if there are exactly two differing positions as swapping the characters at those positions will make s equal to goal. \\n  \\n      - IFF the first differing character position of `differences[0]` is equal to second differing character position `differences[1]` in reverse it will return True/true. Otherwise False/false\\n\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n**Python**\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def buddyStrings(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:\\n        differences = [(s[i], goal[i]) for i in range(len(s)) if s[i] != goal[i] ]\\n    \\n        if len(s) != len(goal): return\\n\\n        if s == goal:\\n            return len(set(s)) < len(s)\\n\\n        if len(differences) == 2:\\n            return differences[0] == differences[1][::-1]\\n        \\n        return False\\n```\\n\\n**JavaScript**\\n```\\n/**\\n * @param {string} s\\n * @param {string} goal\\n * @return {boolean}\\n */\\nvar buddyStrings = function(s, goal) {\\n    let differences = []\\n    let sSet = new Set(s)\\n    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){\\n        if(s[i] !== goal[i]) differences.push([s[i], goal[i]])\\n    }\\n\\n    if(s.length !== goal.length) return false\\n\\n    if(s === goal) return sSet.size < s.length\\n \\n    if(differences.length === 2) return differences[0].toString() === differences[1].reverse().toString()\\n    \\n    return false\\n};\\n```\\n### Time Complexity: O(n)\\n### Space Complexity: O(n)\\n\\n \\n***Warframe\\'s Darvo wants you to upvote this post  \\uD83D\\uDE4F\\uD83C\\uDFFB \\u2764\\uFE0F\\u200D\\uD83D\\uDD25***\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/814f5668-c966-46d7-ba42-e5435c4c1761_1675302761.3081913.gif)",

If the strings aren\\'t the same length\\n2. If the strings are equal\\n3. If the strings aren\\'t equal\\n\\n### Case 1: Not Equal Length <!-- omit from toc -->\\nIf the strings aren\\'t equal, there is no way to get a buddy strings using the swap operation, so we just return false\\n\\n### Case 2: Equal Strings <!-- omit from toc -->\\nIf the strings are equal, then we need to determine if there is a character with a frequency of >1. If that is the case, then we can swap the same character and still have buddy strings.\\n\\nFor example, if s = \"aba\" and goal = \"aba\", then you could swap the two \\'a\\' characters to then have buddy strings. Remember that you MUST swap at least once\\n\\n### Case 3: Not Equal Strings <!-- omit from toc -->\\nIf the strings aren\\'t equal, we want to figure out if they differ in only 2 locations and where those locations are. If they differ in more than 2 locations, then they can\\'t be buddy strings. If they only differ in two locations, we need to ensure that if we swap those characters that the strings would be equal.\\n\\n## Approach \\n\\nWe want to break it up by checking if the strings are equal since we need two different approaches for those two cases.\\n\\nIf the strings are equal, then I used a frequency array to keep track of the frequency of letters. If I encounter a character that has occured more than once, then I return true since we could just swap those characters. If we do not find any character with a frequency of more than 1, then return false.\\n\\nIf the strings aren\\'t equal, then I want to find the locations where the two strings differ using 2 pointers. The first time that they differ, I store the index in the first pointer. The second time that they differ, I store the index in the second pointer. If they differ more than that, I know that the strings cannot be equal by swapping only 2 characters, so I return false. At the end of the iteration, I have to see if there were two differences (`second_diff_idx != -1`) and that the locations where they differ have\\nthe same character in each of them so the swap could be done and have equal strings afterwards (`s[first_diff_idx] == goal[second_diff_idx] && s[second_diff_idx] == goal[first_diff_idx]`)\\n\\n### Tricky Portion of Code <!-- omit from toc -->\\n\\n```c++\\nif (++char_freq[LOWERCASE_TO_INDEX(s[i])] > 1)\\n```\\n\\nOn line 13, I used this to shorter my code. Notice that I am using a macro named `LOWERCASE_TO_INDEX` to convert the lowercase letter to an index in the frequency array. Also, since I am using the pre-pended `++` operator, it adds 1 to the value prior to doing the comparison. That way, if the character has been seen before, it must have a value of 1 before this statement. Then, it will be increamented to 2 prior to the comparison, which is exactly what we want. Please follow up below if this was confusing to you!\\n\\n## Example\\n\\nLets do 2 different examples since there are 2 cases to consider:\\n\\n### Example 1 - Strings Equal\\n\\nLets use an example where `s = \"aba\"` and `t = \"aba\"`. Since `s == t`, we enter the equal case.\\n\\nWe find the frequency of all the characters in one of the strings since they are the same. In our case, we have `\\'a\\' = 2` and `\\'b\\' = 1`.  Since the frequency of `\\'a\\'` is >1, we could swap those characters to keep them buddy strings so we return `true`\\n\\n### Example 2 - Strings Not Equal\\n\\nLets use an example where `s = \"abb\"` and `t = \"bba\"`. We must iterate through all the characters.\\n\\n* i = 0\\n\\n`s[i] != goal[i]`, so we update `first_index = 0`\\n\\n* i = 1\\n\\n`s[i] == goal[i]` so we don\\'t do anything and continue\\n\\n* i = 2\\n\\n`s[i] != goal[i]` so we update `second_index = 2` since `first_index` was already mapped\\n\\n* Aftermath\\n\\nWe know that they only differ in two locations, so we need to check if `s[0] == t[2]` and `s[2] == t[0]`: `s[0] = t[2] = \\'a\\'` and `s[2] = t[0] = \\'b\\'`, so we return `true`\\n\\n**PLEASE UPVOTE IF YOU FIND MY POST HELPFUL!! \\uD83E\\uDD7A\\uD83D\\uDE01**",

                "content": "**Explanation**\\nMy first thought process was to build an O(N^2) solution, by creating all possible strings from A by swapping any two characters. However, I noticed that if I compare each position in two Buddy Strings A and B, then (N-2) positions will correspond, and exactly 2 will be unequal. If the 2 positions which have different characters in A and B be i and j respectively, then further we must have A[i] = B[j] & A[j] = B[i].\\n\\nFor eg. ABCDBA and ADCBBA. Here i = 1, j = 3. All the remaining indices are such that A[k] = B[k].\\n\\nAlso if we have two equal strings, then we won\\'t have any indices i such that A[i] != B[i]. Two equal strings will be buddy strings, only if I have atleast one duplicate character, because I could then swap the duplicate characters.\\nFor eg. ABCDBA and ABCDBA, we can swap (A, A) or (B, B).\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool buddyStrings(string A, string B) {\\n        if (A.length() != B.length()) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        \\n\\t\\t// Stores i  and j.\\n        vector<int> index;\\n\\n\\t\\t// To count for Duplicate Character.\\n        vector<int> freq(26, 0);\\n\\n\\t\\t// Stores whether Duplicate Character Exists.\\n        bool dup = false;\\n        \\n        for (int i=0; i<A.length(); ++i) {\\n\\t\\t\\t// Found the Duplicate. \\n            if (++freq[A[i]-\\'a\\'] > 1) {\\n                dup = true;\\n            }\\n\\n            if (A[i] != B[i]) {\\n                index.push_back(i);\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t// More than 2 Different Characters.\\n                if (index.size() > 2)\\n                    return false;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        if (index.size() < 2) {\\n            if (index.size() == 1)\\n                return false;\\n        \\n            // 0 means identical, if i have duplicates, then True.\\n            return dup;\\n        }\\n        \\n        return (A[index[0]] == B[index[1]] && A[index[1]] == B[index[0]]);\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nThe problem requires checking whether two strings can be made equal by swapping two characters. To solve this, we can iterate over the strings and compare the characters at each position. If we find two positions i and j such that s[i] != goal[i] and s[j] != goal[j], and s[i] == goal[j] and s[j] == goal[i], then it is possible to swap two letters to make the strings equal.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Initialize an unordered map mp to store the characters of string s as keys and a stack of indices where each character occurs as values.\\n2. Initialize variables n and i to store the size of string s and initialize i as 0.\\n3. Iterate over the string s using a while loop until i reaches n.\\n4. If s[i] is not equal to goal[i], check if goal[i] exists in the map mp.\\n5. If it exists, swap s[i] with s[mp[goal[i]].top()] to perform the character swap.\\n6. Create a stack st and assign the stack of indices for the character goal[i] from the map mp.\\n7. While the stack st is not empty and s is still not equal to goal, perform the character swap by swapping s[i] with s[st.top()] and pop the top element of st.\\n8. Push the index i onto the stack for the character s[i] in the map mp.\\n9. Increment i by 1.\\n10. After the loop, check if s is equal to goal and the size of the map mp is less than n.\\n11. If both conditions are satisfied, return true; otherwise, return false.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: The while loop iterates over the string s, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.\\n- Space complexity: The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string s, as we are using a map to store the characters and their indices.\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool buddyStrings(string s, string goal) {\\n        \\n        unordered_map<char,stack<int>> mp ;\\n        int n = s.size();\\n        int i=0;\\n        \\n        while(i<n){                \\n            if(s[i]!=goal[i]){\\n                if(mp.find(goal[i])!=mp.end()){\\n                    swap(s[i],s[mp[goal[i]].top()]);\\n                    stack<int> st = mp[goal[i]];\\n                    while(!st.empty() and s!=goal){\\n                        swap(s[i],s[st.top()]);\\n                        st.pop();\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n            mp[s[i]].push(i);\\n            i++;\\n        }\\n        if(s==goal and mp.size()<n) return true;\\n        return false;   \\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "#### Intuition\\nTo make the string valid with minimum removals, we need to get rid of all parentheses that do not have a matching pair.\\n\\n1. Push char index into the stack when we see `\\'(\\'`.\\n\\n2. Pop from the stack when we see `\\')\\'`.\\n\\n\\t- If the stack is empty, then we have `\\')\\'` without the pair, and it needs to be removed.\\n\\n3. In the end, the stack will contain indexes of `\\'(\\'` without the pair, if any. We need to remove all of them too. \\n\\n**Update:** check out the new approach 2 that collects indexes of all mismatched parentheses, and removes them right-to-left.\\n\\n#### Approach 1: Stack and Placeholder\\n\\nWe mark removed parentheses with `\\'*\\'`, and erase all of them in the end.\\n\\n**Java**\\n```Java\\npublic String minRemoveToMakeValid(String s) {\\n  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);\\n  Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();\\n  for (int i = 0; i < sb.length(); ++i) {\\n    if (sb.charAt(i) == \\'(\\') st.add(i);\\n    if (sb.charAt(i) == \\')\\') {\\n      if (!st.empty()) st.pop();\\n      else sb.setCharAt(i, \\'*\\');\\n    }\\n  }\\n  while (!st.empty())\\n    sb.setCharAt(st.pop(), \\'*\\');\\n  return sb.toString().replaceAll(\"\\\\\\\\*\", \"\");\\n}\\n```\\n**C++**\\n```CPP\\nstring minRemoveToMakeValid(string s) {\\n  stack<int> st;\\n  for (auto i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {\\n    if (s[i] == \\'(\\') st.push(i);\\n    if (s[i] == \\')\\') {\\n      if (!st.empty()) st.pop();\\n      else s[i] = \\'*\\';\\n    }\\n  }\\n  while (!st.empty()) {\\n    s[st.top()] = \\'*\\';\\n    st.pop();\\n  }\\n  s.erase(remove(s.begin(), s.end(), \\'*\\'), s.end());\\n  return s;\\n}\\n```\\n#### Approach 2: Stack with Tracking\\n\\nInstead of using placeholders, we can track indexes of all mismatched parentheses, and erase them in the end going right-to-left. This idea was inspired by [dibdidib](https://leetcode.com/dibdidib/).\\n\\nWe can introduce another stack to collect indexes of mismatched `\\')\\'`, or we can use the same stack and mark mismatched `\\')\\'` somehow. Here, we just negate the index to indicate `\\')\\'`.\\n\\n> Note that I am adding `1` to make the index `1`-based. You cannot tell if zero is negated :)\\n\\n**Java**\\n```Java\\npublic String minRemoveToMakeValid(String s) {\\n  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);\\n  Stack<Integer> st = new Stack();\\n  for (int i = 0; i < sb.length(); ++i) {\\n    if (sb.charAt(i) == \\'(\\') st.add(i + 1);\\n    if (sb.charAt(i) == \\')\\') {\\n      if (!st.empty() && st.peek() >= 0) st.pop();\\n      else st.add(-(i + 1));\\n    }\\n  }\\n  while (!st.empty())\\n    sb.deleteCharAt(Math.abs(st.pop()) - 1);\\n  return sb.toString();\\n}\\n```\\nIf we want to optimize for the worst-case scenario, we should avoid `deleteCharAt` inside the loop. Instead, we can copy characters that do not appear in the stack into another string builder. Since characters in the stack are naturally sorted, we can use two-pointer technique to do it in the linear time.\\n> Note that for the OJ test cases, the runtime of this solution is a bit worse than for `deleteCharAt`.\\n```\\npublic String minRemoveToMakeValid(String s) {\\n  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s), sb1 = new StringBuilder();\\n  Stack<Integer> st = new Stack();\\n  for (int i = 0; i < sb.length(); ++i) {\\n    if (sb.charAt(i) == \\'(\\') st.add(i + 1);\\n    if (sb.charAt(i) == \\')\\') {\\n      if (!st.empty() && st.peek() >= 0) st.pop();\\n      else st.add(-(i + 1));\\n    }\\n  }\\n  for(int i = 0, j = 0; i < sb.length(); ++i) {\\n      if (j >= st.size() || i != Math.abs(st.elementAt(j)) - 1) {\\n        sb1.append(sb.charAt(i));\\n      } else ++j;\\n  }\\n  return sb1.toString();\\n}\\n```\\n**Complexity Analysis**\\n- Time: O(n). We process each character once, or twice for \\'single\\' `\\'(\\'`.\\n- Memory: O(n) for the stack.",

For this step, we will use `count` for storing the number of **close** brackets.\\n\\t- Then, iterate the string `s` from the **end** and at each iteration:\\n\\t\\t- if **close bracket** found, then **increase** `count`.\\n\\t\\t- if **open bracket** found, then check *if* **no. of open brackets > no. of close brackets**, then mark that character in `s` by *replacing* it by **`#`**, *else* **decrease** the `count` ( as **matching parentheses** found ). \\n\\t```\\n\\tcount=0;\\n\\tfor(int i=n-1;i>=0;--i){\\n\\t\\tif(s[i]==\\')\\'){ // for close bracket\\n\\t\\t\\t++count;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\telse if(s[i]==\\'(\\'){ // for open bracket\\n\\t\\t\\tif(count==0){ // if no. of open brackets > no. of close brackets\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ts[i]=\\'#\\';\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\telse{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t// if matching parentheses found decrease count\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t--count;\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\t```\\n- **STEP 3:**\\n\\t- Iterate the string `s` and append each non - marked character (`#`) to `ans` string.\\n\\t- return `ans`.\\n\\t```\\n\\tstring ans=\"\";\\n\\tfor(int i=0;i<n;++i){\\n\\t\\tif(s[i]!=\\'#\\'){ \\n\\t\\t\\tans.push_back(s[i]);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn ans;\\n\\t```\\n\\n**COMPLETE CODE**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    string minRemoveToMakeValid(string s) {\\n        int n=s.length();\\n        // Step 1 : Iterate from start\\n        int count=0; \\n        for(int i=0;i<n;++i){\\n            if(s[i]==\\'(\\'){ // for open bracket\\n                ++count;\\n            }\\n            else if(s[i]==\\')\\'){ // for close bracket\\n                if(count==0){  // if no. of close brackets > no. of open brackets\\n                    s[i]=\\'#\\';\\n                }\\n                else{\\n                    // if matching parentheses found decrease count\\n                    --count;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Step 2 : Iterate from end\\n        count=0;\\n        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;--i){\\n            if(s[i]==\\')\\'){ // for close bracket\\n                ++count;\\n            }\\n            else if(s[i]==\\'(\\'){ // for open bracket\\n                if(count==0){ // if no. of open brackets > no. of close brackets\\n                    s[i]=\\'#\\';\\n                }\\n                else{\\n                    // if matching parentheses found decrease count\\n                    --count;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Step 3 : Create \"ans\" by ignoring the special characters \\'#\\'\\n        string ans=\"\";\\n        for(int i=0;i<n;++i){\\n            if(s[i]!=\\'#\\'){ \\n                ans.push_back(s[i]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**TIME COMPLEXITY**\\n**O(n+n+n) = O(n)** [ *Each step takes O(n) time* ]\\n\\n**SPACE COMPLEXITY**\\n**O(1)** [ *No extra space used, ignoring \"ans\"* ]",

If you like this solution or find it useful,* ***please upvote*** *this post.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n***Idea:***\\n\\nValid parentheses follow the **LIFO method** (last in, first out), so we should automatically be thinking of some kind of **stack** solution.\\n\\nTo check for valid parentheses, you push any **\"(\"** onto **stack**, then pop off the top stack element every time you find a matching **\")\"**. If you find a **\")\"** when **stack** is empty, that **\")\"** must be invalid. At the end of **S**, any leftover **\"(\"**\\'s left in **stack** must be invalid, as well. Since we\\'ll want to remove those **\"(\"**\\'s by index at the end, **stack** should contain said indexes, rather than just the **\"(\"**.\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve identified all the invalid parentheses, that leaves us with the problem of removing them from **S**. We could perform a lot of string slices and copies, but those are typically very slow and memory intensive, so we should probably find a data type that can be directly modified by index access and use that as an intermediary.\\n\\nThe most effective method varies by language, so I\\'ll discuss those in the *Implementation* section.\\n\\nThen we can make our removals and re-form and **return** our answer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n***Implementation:***\\n\\nJavascript has basic arrays, Python has lists, and Java has char arrays that will perform the job of a more flexible data type for this problem. C++ alone of the four languages has mutable strings, so we can just leave **S** as is.\\n\\nWhile Java has stack/deque/list structures, they\\'re not always terribly efficient, so we can just use a more basic int[] with a length fixed to the size of **S**, along with an index variable (**stIx**).\\n\\nJavascript conveniently allows us to directly delete an array element without screwing up our iteration, so we can use that on the initial pass for invalid **\"(\"**\\'s. Python can\\'t do that, but we can easily replace each character we want to delete with an empty string, which effectively does the same thing once the string has been joined again.\\n\\nJava and C++ won\\'t allow us to replace characters with empty strings, so we can just mark those characters with a **character mask** for later removal.\\n\\nOn the second pass through Javascript and Python can just repeat the same method while going through the remaining **stack**. Python is very fast with its appends and pops, so we can use that to our advantage.\\n\\nFor Java and C++, things are more difficult. We can\\'t change the length of the intermediary, but we *can* alter its contents by index assignment. That means we can use a two-pointer approach to rewrite the beginning portion of the intermediary before ultimately returning a subsection of it.\\n\\nSince we want to iterate through **stack** in opposite order (**FIFO**) this time, we can just tag a **-1** onto the end of the stack to avoid issues with going out-of-bounds, and then use **stIx** starting at **0**.\\n\\nThen, for every iteration, **j** will increment, but **i** will only increment if it\\'s not a character we want to remove (either by matching the character mask or the next stack entry), and we\\'ll overwrite the intermediary at **i** with **j**\\'s value.\\n\\nAt the end, the substring between **0** and **i** will represent the \"squeezed\" string with all invalid parentheses removed, so we should **return** it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n***Javascript Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **76ms / 44.7MB** (beats 100% / 96%).\\n```javascript\\nvar minRemoveToMakeValid = function(S) {\\n    S = S.split(\"\")\\n    let len = S.length, stack = []\\n    for (let i = 0, c = S[0]; i < len; c = S[++i])\\n        if (c === \")\")\\n            if (stack.length) stack.pop()\\n            else delete S[i]\\n        else if (c === \"(\") stack.push(i)\\n    for (let i = 0; i < stack.length; i++)\\n        delete S[stack[i]]\\n    return S.join(\"\")\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n***Python Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **72ms / 15.8MB** (beats 100% / 91%).\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, S: str) -> str:\\n        S, stack = list(S), []\\n        for i, c in enumerate(S):\\n            if c == \")\":\\n                if stack: stack.pop()\\n                else: S[i] = \"\"\\n            elif c == \"(\": stack.append(i)\\n        for i in stack: S[i] = \"\"\\n        return \"\".join(S)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n***Java Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **5ms / 39.1MB** (beats 100% / 99%).\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public String minRemoveToMakeValid(String S) {\\n        char[] ans = S.toCharArray();\\n        int len = S.length(), stIx = 0, i = 0, j = 0;\\n        int[] stack = new int[len+1];\\n        for (; i < len; i++)\\n            if (ans[i] == \\')\\')\\n                if (stIx > 0) stIx--;\\n                else ans[i] = \\'_\\';\\n            else if (ans[i] == \\'(\\') stack[stIx++] = i;\\n        for (i = 0, stack[stIx] = -1, stIx = 0; j < len; j++)\\n            if (j == stack[stIx]) stIx++;\\n            else if (ans[j] != \\'_\\') ans[i++] = ans[j];\\n        return new String(ans, 0, i);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n***C++ Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **16ms / 10.2MB** (beats 99% / 91%).\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    string minRemoveToMakeValid(string S) {\\n        int len = S.size(), i = 0, j = 0, stIx = 0;\\n        vector<int> stack;\\n        for (; i < len; i++)\\n            if (S[i] == \\')\\')\\n                if (stack.size() > 0) stack.pop_back();\\n                else S[i] = \\'_\\';\\n            else if (S[i] == \\'(\\') stack.push_back(i);\\n        stack.push_back(-1);\\n        for (i = 0; j < len; j++)\\n            if (j == stack[stIx]) stIx++;\\n            else if (S[j] != \\'_\\') S[i++] = S[j];\\n        return S.substr(0, i);\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "When you see in problem formulation, that it is something about valid parantheses, you should immedietly thing about **stack**, because the very classical problems in this topic uses stack.\\n\\nLet us traverse our string from left to right and make sure, that we do not have any problems with balance:\\n1. If symbol is `(`, then we increase balance by `1` and add this symbol to `ans`.\\n2. If symbol is `)`, then we can add this symbol only if balance is positive: if it is `0`, then we can not recover our string if we continue.\\n3. If symbol not `(` and not `)`, we add it to `ans`.\\n\\nHowever, it is not enough to do only one traverse: so far when we finished, we can say that:\\n1. Balance is never negative\\n2. But balance in the end should be equal to `0`.\\n\\nThese `2` conditions and **sufficient** and **enough** to have valid parentheses and at the moment only the fist one is fulfilled. What we can do now is to traverse string from the end and keep removing symbols until balance becomes equal to `0`. Or we can use our `clean` function and apply it to reversed string.\\n\\n**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, we traverse our string twice. Space complexity is also `O(n)`.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s):\\n        def clean(s, op, cl):\\n            balance, ans = 0, \"\"\\n            for i in s:\\n                if i == op:\\n                    balance += 1\\n                    ans += i\\n                elif i == cl and balance > 0:\\n                    balance -= 1\\n                    ans += i\\n                elif i not in \"()\":\\n                    ans += i              \\n            return ans\\n        \\n        return clean(clean(s, \"(\", \")\")[::-1], \")\", \"(\")[::-1]\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any question, feel free to ask.

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe problem requires us to remove the minimum number of characters from a given string to make the parentheses valid. A valid parenthesis string is one in which each opening parenthesis \\'(\\' has a corresponding closing parenthesis \\')\\'. The basic idea to solve this problem is to iterate through the string while keeping track of the count of opening and closing brackets. Any closing bracket encountered when there are no available opening brackets to match with should be removed. Additionally, any leftover opening brackets after processing the entire string should be removed.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n- Initialize a counter variable c to keep track of the unmatched opening brackets.\\n- Iterate through the string s character by character.\\n- - If the current character is an opening bracket \\'(\\', increment the counter c.\\n- - If the current character is a closing bracket \\')\\':\\n- - If the counter c is greater than 0, decrement the counter to indicate that an opening bracket has been matched.\\n- - If the counter c is 0, mark the current character with a special marker (\\'#\\') to indicate that it needs to be removed later.\\n- After the first iteration, we know the number of opening brackets that need to be removed to make the string valid. Also, determine whether the leftover characters should be \\'(\\' or \\')\\', based on the value of the counter c.\\n- Iterate through the string in reverse:\\nIf the current character is marked with \\'#\\', remove it from the string.\\n- If the current character is the leftover character (\\'(\\' or \\')\\') and the counter c is greater than 0, decrement the counter and remove the character from the string.\\nReturn the modified string as the result.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- ## Time complexity: \\nThe algorithm iterates through the input string twice, once to mark the characters and once to remove the marked characters. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.\\n\\n- ## Space complexity: \\nThe algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables and markers, so the space complexity is O(1).\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    string minRemoveToMakeValid(string s) {\\n        int c=0;\\n        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)\\n        {\\n            if(s[i]==\\'(\\')\\n            {\\n                c++;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            if(s[i]==\\')\\') \\n            {\\n                if(c>0)\\n                {\\n                    c--;\\n                }\\n                else\\n                s[i]=\\'#\\';\\n            }\\n        }\\n        string w=\"\";\\n        char remchar= c>0? \\'(\\' : \\')\\';\\n        c=c>0 ? c : -c;\\n        for(int i=s.length()-1; i>=0 ;i--)\\n        {\\n            if(s[i]==\\'#\\') \\n            s.erase(s.begin()+i);\\n\\n            if(s[i]==remchar && c>0)\\n            {\\n                c--;\\n                s.erase(s.begin()+i);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return s;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/37206f67-0c0f-499b-846d-efeb80f07ece_1692465910.9151525.png)\\n\\n# PLEASE UPVOTE THE SOLUTION IF IT HELPED YOU UNDERSTAND \\n\\n",

I like to solve 240 algorithms in 2020. This is my first one. \\n\\n**Case study**\\nIn order for me to solve the algorithm, I learn that I have to put two test cases into consideration. \\nCase 1: lee(t(c)o)de)\\nThe idea is to use stack to store all indexes of open paretheses, and if there is \\')\\', then remove matched open parethese. Otherwise replace stringbuilder temporary variable **copy** - a copy of string - using placeholder char * at index of \\')\\'. We can name it \"replace unmatched close parenthese with wildchar *\". \\n\\nlee(t(c)o)de) -> lee(t(c)o)de* -> remove * in the string. \\nput \\'(\\' in stack, and if there is matched \\')\\', then pop \\'(\\' otherwise replace stringBuilder index position with \\'*\\'.\\n\\nCase 2: ))((\\nDo not forget to pop out all chars in the stack, remove open parenthese \\'(\\' at the index position in **copy** variable. \\n\\nHere are my C# practice highlights:\\n1. C# string is immutable, so declare a StringBuilder variable to make a copy of string. \\n2. Get familiar with C# StringBuilder.Replace and Remove API, empty char has issue to use Replace, so empty string \"\" works. \\n3. Always work on my weakness, come out test cases to fully test the code by myself first. This time I missed test case ))((.

It iterates through the input string and pushes a pair of the current character and its index onto the stack if the current character is \\'(\\'. If the current character is \\')\\', the function checks if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack contains \\'(\\'. If so, the function pops the top of the stack. Otherwise, it pushes a pair of \\')\\' and its index onto the stack.\\n\\nAfter iterating through the input string, the function constructs a new string by iterating through the input string again in reverse order. If the current index matches the index of a closing parenthesis on top of the stack, the function skips adding the character to the new string. Otherwise, the function adds the character to the new string. Finally, the new string is reversed to obtain the desired output.\\n\\nThe ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); line is used to optimize input/output operations by disabling the synchronization between the standard input/output streams of C++ and the corresponding C streams.

If the stack is empty, then we mark the index of string s[i]=\\'#\\'.\\n- finally we would have marked all the invalid \\')\\' paranthesis.\\n- now we might have a invalid \\'(\\' in the end of the string, but that will be remaining in the stack.\\n* so we pop the stack until its empty and mark the corresponding index of remaining \\'(\\' as #.\\n* now we loop over the entire string and append(push_back) only the characters which are not \\'#\\' to our answer string.\\n    \\n```\\nstring minRemoveToMakeValid(string s) {\\n        string ans=\"\";\\n        stack<int> st;\\n        for(int i=0;i<s.length();++i){\\n            if(s[i]==\\'(\\') st.push(i);\\n            else if(s[i]==\\')\\'){\\n                if(st.empty()){\\n                    s[i]=\\'#\\';\\n                }\\n                else{\\n                    st.pop();\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        while(!st.empty()){\\n            s[st.top()]=\\'#\\';\\n            st.pop();\\n        }\\n        for(int i=0;i<s.length();++i){\\n            if(s[i]!=\\'#\\'){\\n                ans.push_back(s[i]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n        }\\n```\\n        \\n    \\n    \\n",

As a result, Alice starts with an inmense loss ```-sum(B)```, and every stone ```A[i]``` she takes gives her a net gain ```A[i]+B[i]```, because she gains the value of the stone (```A[i]```) plus what she takes away from Bob\\'s score ```B[i]```.\\n\\nThe algorithm then becomes very easy to program, because we can build an array with the gains for Alice ```G=A+B```, where we can sort the entries to find the upcoming optimal moves. Also, Bob in his turn will try to delete the biggest entries in this array, since they are the biggest gains for Alice.\\n\\nThe implementation of the program is thus very simple. It\\'s incredible how easy a problem can become once you rephrase the question.\\n\\nI hope the explanation was helpful.\\nCheers,\\n\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def stoneGameVI(self, A, B):\\n        G  = [a+b for a,b in zip(A,B)]\\n        G.sort()\\n        L  = len(A)\\n        d  = -sum(B) + sum( G[i] for i in range(L-1,-1,-2) )\\n        return 1 if d>0 else ( -1 if d<0 else 0 )\\n```",

                "content": "Great problem and my first usage of a `multimap`, rushing to check its docs while trying to complete the problem itself on time - quite fun!\\n\\nMy basic assumption was that in order to figure out the most convenient move for each player, we have to sum their matching scores: it is not just how much it gives you directly, but it is also how much you manage to \"steal\" from your opponent!\\n\\nIn order to do this, a multimap comes in really handy, since it allow us to store even repeated keys if necessary (some stones might have the same overall value of others) and keeps them nicely sorted for us on top of it.\\n\\nTo go in that direction, we declare first of all a few support variables:\\n* `diffs` is our aforementioned `multimap` storing the summed score as a key and the matching index as a value; passing the second optional parameter will make our live easier, if we tell it to sort results using `greater<int>`, for example;\\n* `len`, `aScore` and `bScore` are all integers storing the length of the input and the scores for Alice and Bob, both set initially to `0`;\\n* `aTurn` is a simple boolean to tell us if it is Alice or Bob to do the next move - initially set to `true` since the rules are that Alice will always move first.\\n\\nWith that laid out, we then proceed to populate `diffs` as stated before, summing the values of each position as a key and passing the index of said position as a value.\\n\\nTime then to go for the actual development of the game, which is rather straightforward now: we will loop through all the best moves (kindly sorted for us by our `multimap`) and alternatively assign it to Alice or Bob, flipping our boolean at each iteration to know who moves next.\\n\\nOnce done, we can return a value according to their cumulated score and be done with it :)\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int stoneGameVI(vector<int>& ali, vector<int>& bob) {\\n        // support variables\\n        multimap<int, int, greater<int>> diffs;\\n        int len = ali.size(), aScore = 0, bScore = 0;\\n        bool aTurn = true;\\n        // populating diffs\\n        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\\n            diffs.insert({(ali[i] + bob[i]), i});\\n        }\\n        for (auto e: diffs) {\\n            // playing the optimal move for each player\\n            if (aTurn) aScore += ali[e.second];\\n            else bScore += bob[e.second];\\n            aTurn = !aTurn;\\n        }\\n        return aScore == bScore ? 0 : aScore > bScore ? 1 : -1; \\n    }\\n};\\n```",

For each stone with value a for Alice and b for Bob, if Alice takes it, her score +a, if Bob takes it, the value Alice loses would be -b, so the gap for each stone is a-(-b)=a+b. Our goal is to maximize the difference/gap, thus we pick the next available item with biggest (a+b) value.\\n\\nMy first attempt was to use two different priority queues to determine the next item to take = max(next biggest value for the current player, next  biggest value for the other), this failed when two inputs are [8,8,1],[7,8,1] , priority queue just gives one 8 without caring about first 8 or second 8 from Alice\\'s queue, but Alice particularly needs the 2nd 8, because it minimize opponent\\'s gain.

Yes, we could.\\nLet sum of Alice\\'s values be `A` and `B` be that of Bob\\'s.\\nSuppose for certain strategies, Alice picked certain stones, of which value sum is `VA` and consensus sum (i.e. sum of values of those picked of both Alice and Bob) is `CA`, similarly `VB` and `CB` for Bob.\\n\\nPseudo-code in rust would be like:\\n``` rust\\nuse std::collections::HashSet;\\n\\nlet A = alice_values.iter().sum();\\nlet mut alice_indices = HashSet::new();\\n// some Alice strategy to fill in the hash set\\nlet VA = alice_indices.iter().fold(0, |sum, idx| sum + alice_values[idx]);\\nlet CA = alice_indices.iter().fold(0, |sum, idx| sum + alice_values[idx] + bob_values[idx]);\\n\\nlet B = bob_values.iter().sum();\\nlet mut bob_indices = HashSet::new();\\n// some Bob strategy to fill in the hash set\\nlet VB = bob_indices.iter().fold(0, |sum, idx| sum + bob_values[idx]);\\nlet CB = bob_indices.iter().fold(0, |sum, idx| sum + alice_values[idx] + bob_values[idx]);\\n\\nlet Alice_prevent_Bob_from_these = CA - VA;\\nlet ApBft = &Alice_prevent_Bob_from_these;\\nlet Bob_prevent_Alice_from_these = CB - VB;\\nlet BpAft = &Bob_prevent_Alice_from_these;\\n```\\n\\nHere\\'s the most important observation: `BpAft + VA == A` and `ApBft + VB == B`, which is straightforward: sum of Alice\\'s values is exactly those Alice got plus those Bob prevents Alice from obtaining.\\n\\nClaim: `CA + A >= CB + B` iff Alice wins.\\nProof:\\n`CA + A >= CB + B`\\n`VA + ApBft + A >= VB + BpAft + B` by definition of `ApBft` and `BpAft`\\n`VA + ApBft + BpAft + VA >= VB + BpAft + ApBft + VB` by our observation.\\nCancel same terms, we have:\\n`VA + VA >= VB + VB`. Alice wins. Converse part is the same.\\n\\nFinally, we note that `A`, `B`, and `CA + CB == A + B` are all constant.\\nAlice\\'s optimal strategy is just maximizing `CA`, similarly Bob maximizing `CB`.\\nAgain since `CA + CB == A + B` is constant, this becomes an obvious greedy game, where Alice and Bob pickes stone by its consensus value.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\nTo prevent overflow, based on the intuition that Alice and Bob won\\'t have too much disagreement on value of any stone, we keep track of differences instead.\\nRecall that Alice win iff `CA + A >= CB + B`, which in term equivalent to `CA - CB >= B - A`, we record these two terms on the two sides of inequality.\\nSince both players\\' optimal way is choosing based on consensus sum, we make the consensus sum by summing the two array and sort it.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n`O(n*lg(n))` since sort and linear scan.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nDepends solely on sorting algorithm.

In other words, in this question we have a pile of stones where both only think different values for themselves. But what I am saying is assume that you have a new pile of stones, where Alice\\'s array and Bob\\'s array piles of stones are present. \\nEx - Given, A = [1, 2 ,3] & B = [2, 6, 7];\\nSo, assume new pile of stones is [1, 2, 2, 3, 6, 7]. And assume that in alice and bob are playing this game where they have to choose an element from this array. Only difference is that, when they will choose an element from this array, one more element will be out from this array. This is our question? \\nWhenever you are choosing an element you are taking one element of the other also. So, the total value by which you are making his loss is a[i] + b[i], and yourself gaining as b[i]/a[i] based on what you choose.

I managed to solve other Stone Game problems (before I solved this one) which were much more harder than this one. But Greedy problems can be elusive and this problem is evidence of that. I tried this problem for a long time. The problem with greedy problems is - you have to find the right strategy. Unlike DP and backtracking which are brute force methods. Greedy is purely about finding the shortcut. And it is hard to find shortcuts.\\n\\nBest way to work around greedy problems is take the test cases and come  up with various strategies, \\nin this particular problem I thought about various complicated ways that involved priority_queues to simulate best pick for both Alice and bob, but they just didn\\'t work. \\n\\n## All about observation\\nTurns out it was a simple observation, which is you just evaluate how precious each stone is. i.e.  **how both Alice and Bob value each stone and sort them in descending order.** Then you just start picking in that order Alice first then Bob till you are done.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s it.\\n\\n\\n```\\nbool comp(const pair<int, int>& p1, const pair<int, int>& p2) {\\n    return p1.first > p2.first;\\n}\\n\\n\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int stoneGameVI(vector<int>& aliceValues, vector<int>& bobValues) {\\n        \\n        int n = aliceValues.size();\\n        vector<pair<int, int>> precious;\\n        \\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            precious.push_back(make_pair(aliceValues[i] + bobValues[i], i));\\n        }\\n        \\n        sort(precious.begin(), precious.end(), comp); \\n        int alice = 0, bob = 0;\\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            if(i & 1)\\n                bob += bobValues[precious[i].second];\\n            else\\n                alice += aliceValues[precious[i].second];\\n        }\\n        \\n        if(alice > bob)\\n            return 1;\\n        if(alice < bob)\\n            return -1;\\n        return 0;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Everytime Alice takes a stone, Bob loses `aliceStone[i] + bobStone[i]` of score.

You can further change the problem now as Alice has 0 score at the beginning and at each time she plays, she gets `aliceStone[i] + bobStone[i]` score for what she picks. She wins if her score at the end is bigger that the sum of the value of stones in Bob\\'s eyes.\\n\\nThe equivalent game is easy to look at. Alice simply just wants to maximize sum of `aliceStone[i] + bobStone[i]` for stones she picks. And Bob wants to minimize the score of Alice. So the optimum play is for each player to pick the stone with biggest `aliceStone[i] + bobStone[i]` everytime.\\n\\nWe can now compute Alice\\'s score for this modified game and optimum play and compare it to sum of the value of Stones in Bob\\'s eyes to see the result.\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def stoneGameVI(self, pilesA: List[int], pilesB: List[int]) -> bool:\\n        base = sum(pilesB)\\n        piles = [a + b for (a,b) in zip(pilesA, pilesB)]\\n        piles = list(reversed(sorted(piles)))\\n        score = sum(piles[::2])\\n\\n        if score > base:\\n            return 1\\n        if score < base:\\n            return -1\\n        if score == base:\\n            return 0\\n```\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/5bf471ae-4476-4e90-b0c7-eb63febee17e_1643594288.7818723.png)\\n",
