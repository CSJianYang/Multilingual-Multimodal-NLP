        "question_content": "Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).\nThe algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:\n\n\tRead in and ignore any leading whitespace.\n\tCheck if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.\n\tRead in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\n\tConvert these digits into an integer (i.e. \"123\" -> 123, \"0032\" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\n\tIf the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.\n\tReturn the integer as the final result.\n\nNote:\n\n\tOnly the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.\n\tDo not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.\n\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"42\"\nOutput: 42\nExplanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.\nStep 1: \"42\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"42\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n           ^\nThe parsed integer is 42.\nSince 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"   -42\"\nOutput: -42\nExplanation:\nStep 1: \"   -42\" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)\n            ^\nStep 2: \"   -42\" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)\n             ^\nStep 3: \"   -42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n               ^\nThe parsed integer is -42.\nSince -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"4193 with words\"\nOutput: 4193\nExplanation:\nStep 1: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"4193 with words\" (\"4193\" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)\n             ^\nThe parsed integer is 4193.\nSince 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\t0 <= s.length <= 200\n\ts consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.",

If we look at **1st testcase**. We have Given a string with numerical values & we will simply return in Integral value and **return 42**.\\n2. If we look at **2nd testcase**. First we see we have some space \"and it\\'s clearly mentioned in question, we need to **discard whitespace**\", then we **takecare of sign** & use sign as it is & finally use numerical value **return -42**.\\n3.  If we look at **3rd testcase**. We look for **whitespace**, but we **dont have** it. Then we will see wether it have a **sign** or not. Then we will see wether the **1st value numerical** or not. So, we found it is and simply go for **4193**, again we will check after this numerical value do we have more numerical value & **states No**. then we simply **return 4193**\\n4.  Coming to **4th testcase**. We see that it dont have whitespace, dont have any sign. And very first sequence is non-numerical and simply **return 0**\\n5.  Coming to **5th testcase**.

Similarly, if the input is -123, then the output should be -321.\\n\\n# Approach:\\n1. Initialize a variable \\'reverse\\' to store the reversed number. Also, initialize a variable \\'num\\' to store the input number \\'x\\'.\\n2. Use a while loop to iterate until the input number \\'x\\' becomes 0.\\n3. Inside the loop, find the last digit of the input number \\'x\\' using the modulo operator and store it in a variable \\'digit\\'.\\n4. Multiply the \\'reverse\\' variable by 10 and add the \\'digit\\' variable to it. This will reverse the number digit by digit.\\n5. Divide the input number \\'x\\' by 10 and store the quotient back to \\'x\\'. This will remove the last digit of \\'x\\' in each iteration.\\n6. Check if the \\'reverse\\' variable overflows the integer range or not. If it overflows, then return 0.\\n7. Return the \\'reverse\\' variable as the output.\\n\\n# Complexity:\\n- Time Complexity: O(log(x)), where x is the input number.\\nIn each iteration, the input number is divided by 10, so the time complexity will be proportional to the number of digits in the input number, which is log(x).\\n- Space Complexity: O(1)\\nWe are not using any extra data structure to store the input or output, so the space complexity is constant.\\n---\\n# C++\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int myAtoi(string s) {\\n        int len = s.size();\\n        double num = 0;\\n        int i=0;\\n        while(s[i] == \\' \\'){\\n            i++;\\n        }\\n        bool positive = s[i] == \\'+\\';\\n        bool negative = s[i] == \\'-\\';\\n        positive == true ? i++ : i;\\n        negative == true ? i++ : i;\\n        while(i < len && s[i] >= \\'0\\' && s[i] <= \\'9\\'){\\n            num = num*10 + (s[i]-\\'0\\');\\n            i++;\\n        }\\n        num = negative ? -num : num;\\n        num = (num > INT_MAX) ?

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe goal of this problem is to convert a given string to an integer. The string may contain leading/trailing spaces, optional positive/negative signs, and non-numeric characters. We can achieve this by iterating through the string and processing each character.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nFirst, we trim the input string to remove any leading or trailing spaces. We also initialize a boolean variable check to false, which will indicate whether the number is negative or not. We then iterate through the string, character by character, and perform the following operations:\\n\\nIf the current character is a - sign, we set check to true.\\nIf the current character is a + sign, we set check to false.\\nIf the current character is a digit, we convert it to its corresponding integer value using Character.getNumericValue(c). We then update the num variable by multiplying it by 10 and adding the new digit to it.\\nIf the current character is not a digit, we break out of the loop.\\nAfter processing all characters, we check if the number is negative by looking at the check variable. If it is, we return the negation of num. We also check if num exceeds the range of Integer.MAX_VALUE and return either Integer.MAX_VALUE or -1 * Integer.MAX_VALUE accordingly.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe algorithm iterates through each character of the input string once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe algorithm uses a constant amount of space, so the space complexity is O(1).\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int myAtoi(String s) {\\n        s = s.trim();\\n        boolean isNegative = false;\\n        int num = 0;\\n        int i = 0;\\n\\n        if (s.length() == 0) {\\n            return 0;\\n        }\\n\\n        if (s.charAt(0) == \\'-\\') {\\n            isNegative = true;\\n            i++;\\n        } else if (s.charAt(0) == \\'+\\') {\\n            i++;\\n        }\\n\\n        for (; i < s.length(); i++) {\\n            char c = s.charAt(i);\\n            if (!Character.isDigit(c)) {\\n                break;\\n            }\\n            int digit = Character.getNumericValue(c);\\n            if (num > (Integer.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 10) {\\n                return isNegative ?

After trimming this sign can be at first postion for this to be a valid string. By default, sign should be positive (i.e. 1). This sign we will use to determine our final answer in the end\\n\\n(3) Determine the start of the loop. We the input string has a leading sign, we should start with 1st index since we have already covered the sign part in (2). Or else we would start with 0th index\\n\\n(4) We start the loop on our string and determine the digit by subtracting 48. (ASCII values of digits 0-9 are 48-57). So if our char is \\'0\\', to get the actual digit value we would do, 48-48 = 0. If the char is \\'1\\', 49-48 = 1.\\n\\n5) We check if the number is in range 0 and 9 if not we break the loop since it is not a valid character and we do not need to look further\\n\\n6) Now we have 2 main checks, one for positive sign and one for negative sign. If number is positive (i.e. sign = 1) then we check if the calculation does not cause integer overflow if it does then we return Integer MAX VALUE. \\nTo add the digit to our answer we would need to multiply by 10, so we have to check if this multiplication does not cause overflow. \\n(ans <= Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10).\\nNext check is to check when we add the digit to our answer, it does not overflow\\n(ans * 10) < Integer.MAX_VALUE - num)\\nWe do the same thing if number is negative (sign = -1), only difference here is we have to multiply our answer by sign -1 since number is negative.\\n\\n7) Finally, we multiply the answer with the sign we determined at the start\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(N) - Only one loop over the string \\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(1) - No extra space is used\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int myAtoi(String s) {\\n\\t\\ts = s.trim();\\n\\t\\tif (s.length() < 1)\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 0;\\n\\n\\t\\tint sign = 1;\\n\\t\\tint i =0;\\n\\t\\tif(s.charAt(0) == \\'-\\') {\\n\\t\\t\\tsign = -1;\\n\\t\\t\\ti = 1;\\n\\t\\t} else if(s.charAt(0) == \\'+\\') {\\n\\t\\t\\ti = 1;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\tint ans = 0;\\n\\t\\tfor (; i < s.length(); i++) {\\n\\t\\t\\tint num = s.charAt(i) - 48;\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tif ((num >= 0 && num <= 9)) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif (sign > 0) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif (ans <= Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 \\n                        && ((ans * 10) < Integer.MAX_VALUE - num)) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tans = ans * 10 + num;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treturn Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif (sign < 0) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif (ans * sign >= Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10\\n                        && ((ans * 10) * sign > Integer.MIN_VALUE + num)) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tans = ans * 10 + num;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treturn Integer.MIN_VALUE;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak;\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\treturn ans * sign;\\n\\n\\t \\n        \\n    }\\n}\\n```",

This is because of the following condition\\n\\t\\t* Had we created a variable with the integer datatype, in a case where our integer limit exceeds, we would get out of the loop and further get an error while returning the answer.\\n\\t*  So finally the reason behind doing so is so that we can check whether we have exceeded the positive and the negative integer limit or not. In such a case, we would return the ```INT_MAX``` and the ```INT_MIN``` numbers *(As stated in the question)*\\n\\n```\\nif(flag == -1){\\n\\tif(ans * -1 < INT_MIN){\\n\\t\\treturn INT_MIN;\\n\\t}\\n} else {\\n\\tif(ans > INT_MAX){\\n\\t\\treturn INT_MAX;\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFinally, we return the ```ans``` variable after multiplying it with the ```flag``` *(Sign of the variable)* followed by typecasting it to integer.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int myAtoi(string s) {\\n        // Base Case: String is empty\\n        if(s.length() == 0){\\n            return 0;\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Removing the leading whitespaces\\n        int i = 0;\\n        while(s[i] == \\' \\'){\\n            i++;\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Removing the whitespaces by creating a substring\\n        // And updating that as the given string;\\n        s = s.substr(i);\\n        \\n        // Checking the sign of the given number\\n        // In the end we will multiply this with the answer\\n        int flag = 1;\\n        if(s[0] == \\'-\\'){\\n            flag = -1;\\n        }\\n        \\n        /* \\n            If the first character is a sign, then we iterate from \\n            the next index and else we continue with the 0 index.\\n        */\\n        \\n        i = (s[0] == \\'+\\' || s[0] == \\'-\\') ? 1 : 0;\\n        \\n        /*\\n            Initiating the answer variable as long ans\\n            Since if in case the answer exceeds the integer limit\\n            The loop below would break and thereafter we couldn\\'t\\n            Return our variable as integer, possibly giving errors\\n        */\\n        \\n        long ans = 0;\\n        \\n        /*\\n            Running the loop below\\n            Here, we keep 2 conditions:\\n                -> i is less than the length of string\\n                -> the character i is pointing to lies between 0 to 9\\n            \\n            This satisfies the confition where we might face another \\n            Character while getting numbers or even another whitespace\\n            \\n            After that, we check whether we have exceeded the integer limit\\n            Or not.

The method has some considerations which are mentioned in its docstring ***`(please do read)`***. The method performs the following steps:\\n\\n1. Define two constants `maxInt` and `minInt` as the maximum and minimum integer values that can be represented using 32 bits.\\n\\n2. Initialize the integer variables `result`, `startIdx`, and `sign` to 0, 0, and 1, respectively. \\n\\n3. Remove any leading whitespace characters from the input string `s` using the `lstrip()` method and store it in a variable called `cleanStr`. If `cleanStr` is an empty string, return `result`.\\n\\n4. Check if the first character of `cleanStr` at `startIdx` is either `\"+\"` or `\"-\"`. If it is `\"-\"`, set the `sign` variable to -1, otherwise, leave it as 1. If the first character is a sign, increment `startIdx` by 1.\\n\\n5. Iterate through the remaining characters in `cleanStr` starting at index `startIdx`. If a non-digit character is encountered, break the loop. If a digit is encountered, add it to the `result` variable by multiplying it by 10 and adding the integer value of the character.\\n\\n6. Check if the final result multiplied by `sign` is greater than `maxInt`. If it is, return `maxInt`. If it is less than or equal to `minInt`, return `minInt`.\\n\\n7. If the value is within the range of `maxInt` and `minInt`, return the value multiplied by `sign`.\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(n)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(1)\\n\\n`Time complexity`:\\n- The method performs a single pass through the input string, which takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the length of the input string.\\n- The string operations such as `lstrip()` and `isdigit()` take constant time per character, so they don\\'t affect the overall time complexity of the algorithm.\\n- Therefore, the `time complexity` of the method is `O(n)`.\\n\\n`Space complexity`:\\n- The method uses a constant amount of extra space to store integer variables and constants, so the `space complexity` is `O(1)`.\\n- The additional space required by the method doesn\\'t depend on the input size, so it is considered `constant`.\\n\\nTherefore, the overall `time complexity` is `O(n)` and the `space complexity` is `O(1)`.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Considerations:        \\n        1.

                "content": "## So firstly we need to identify the  number in the string and for that we have the regular expression. But before we do that we must strip the extra white space that we have, in order to do so we have s = s.strip(). After this is done we get to the regular expression part. Our numbers have the following pattern +12 232 -232 numbers or digits and also with signs. So in the string it will identify that number for us. Now let me explain the regular expression I have made use of here, pattern = re.compile(r\\'[-+]?[0-9]+\\'). The [+-]? means it has either a plus or minus but that is also optional, which is represented by the \\'?\\' sign. For ex we can have numbers like +12 or 12 -12 or 12 like that, after that we have digits the pattern to macth digits is  => [0-9]+,  the \\'+\\' indicates one or more of. For ex we have  : 1, 112, 121212 like that. Once we have out match we need to make sure that the string starts with the match for example con sider this testcase \"words with 2390\" will have the match as 2390 but the asnwer is 0 as the string does not start with the \\'match string that our regular expression provides us\\', but for 34.4545 the match will be 34 and since the string also starts with the match i,e, 34 we return the match and hence the anwer is 34. The last edge case is to hadle if the string is empty or there are simply no digits in that case word_list will be empty in that case we simple return 0. The value you get if the string aslo starts with it then you have your possible answer and to make sure it is rght just check if its int value is in range[-2*31 to 2*31-1] and if not clip it else return value.  Upvote if you liked it\\n\\n# Just wanted to add one more thing, the line  word_list = pattern.findall(s) will find the matching pattern numbers and create a list of those numbers in a list format, we will only have either one value or none if in case we dont have any numbers in string at all or if it is an empty string.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:\\n        pattern = re.compile(r\\'[-+]?[0-9]+\\')\\n        s = s.strip()\\n        word_list = pattern.findall(s)\\n        if word_list:\\n            value = word_list[0]\\n            if s.startswith(value):\\n                value = int(value)\\n                if value > 2**(31)-1:\\n                    return 2**(31)-1\\n                elif value < -2**(31):\\n                    return -2**(31)\\n                else:\\n                    return value\\n            else:\\n                return 0\\n        else:\\n            return 0\\n        \\n```",

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe problem is to implement a function that converts a given string to an integer, taking into account leading whitespace, sign, and non-digit characters. My first thought is to iterate over the string, keeping track of the sign, digits, and non-digit characters encountered, and then convert the digits to an integer at the end.\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nMy approach is to first remove leading whitespace from the string using the `lstrip` method, and then check if the string is empty after stripping whitespace. If it is empty, return 0. Next, I check if the first character is a sign (+ or -). If it is, I keep track of the sign and remove the sign character from the string. If it is not a sign, the sign is assumed to be positive.\\n\\nNext, I read in digits until a non-digit character is encountered, keeping track of the digits encountered in a list. I then convert the digits to an integer using the `int` function, and multiply the integer by the sign to get the final integer value. Finally, I clamp the integer to the range [-231, 231 - 1] using the `max` and `min` functions, and return the clamped value.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate over each character in the string once, and perform constant time operations for each character.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n \\n- Space complexity: The space complexity of this solution is also O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we create a list to store the digits encountered, which can be at most n/2 in length (if all characters are digits), and the rest of the variables used in the function are constant space.\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:\\n        # remove leading whitespace\\n        s = s.lstrip()\\n    \\n    # check if the string is empty after stripping whitespace\\n        if len(s) == 0:\\n            return 0\\n    \\n    # check if the first character is a sign\\n        if s[0] == \\'-\\' or s[0] == \\'+\\':\\n            sign = -1 if s[0] == \\'-\\' else 1\\n            s = s[1:]  # remove the sign character\\n        else:\\n            sign = 1\\n    \\n    # read in digits until a non-digit character is encountered\\n        digits = []\\n        for c in s:\\n            if c.isdigit():\\n                digits.append(c)\\n            else:\\n                break\\n    \\n    # convert digits to an integer\\n        if len(digits) == 0:\\n            return 0\\n        else:\\n            num = int(\\'\\'.join(digits))\\n            num *= sign\\n    \\n    # clamp the integer to the range [-2**31, 2**31 - 1]\\n        num = max(num, -2**31)\\n        num = min(num, 2**31 - 1)\\n    \\n        return num\\n```",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nThis code uses the re(regular expression) library to extract the digits from the given string. The re.findall() method is used to find all the consecutive digits in the string. The parameter passed to the findall() method, \\'^\\\\d+\\' matches all digits that occur one or more times at the beginning of the string.\\n\\nThe lstrip() method is used to remove leading whitespaces. The code then checks the first character of the remaining string and sets the sign accordingly. The int() method converts the digits that are found using the regular expression to an integer and the final step checks if the number is within the range of 32-bit signed integers, if not, it clamps the number to the minimum or maximum value of the range.\\n\\n# Approach\\nThe code is implementing the myAtoi function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer. The intuition behind the code is as follows:\\n\\n* First, the leading whitespaces are ignored by using the lstrip() method.\\n* Next, the code checks if the next character is \\'-\\' or \\'+\\' and sets the sign accordingly.\\n* The code then uses a regular expression to find all consecutive digits in the string, and stores them in the variable \"digits\". If no digits are found, the function returns 0.\\n* The digits are then converted to an integer using the int() function.\\n* Finally, the code checks if the integer is within the range of a 32-bit signed integer [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], and if not, it clamps the integer to the minimum or maximum value respectively.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity of this code is O(d), where d is the number of digits in the number.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nimport re\\n\\ndef myAtoi(s):\\n    # Step 1: Read in and ignore any leading whitespace\\n    s = s.lstrip()\\n    \\n    # Step 2: Check if the next character is \\'-\\' or \\'+\\'\\n    sign = 1\\n    if s and (s[0] == \\'-\\' or s[0] == \\'+\\'):\\n        sign = -1 if s[0] == \\'-\\' else 1\\n        s = s[1:]\\n    \\n    # Step 3: Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached\\n    digits = re.findall(r\\'^\\\\d+\\', s)\\n    if not digits:\\n        return 0\\n    else:\\n        digits = digits[0]\\n    \\n    # Step 4: Convert these digits into an integer\\n    num = int(digits)\\n    \\n    # Step 5: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then clamp the integer\\n    INT_MIN = -2**31\\n    INT_MAX = 2**31 - 1\\n    if num * sign < INT_MIN:\\n        return INT_MIN\\n    elif num * sign > INT_MAX:\\n        return INT_MAX\\n    else:\\n        return num * sign\\n\\n\\n                \\n```",

If present before a number, then return 0.\n3) If received 2 signs continuosly or without a number in between then return 0.\n4) If characters other than whitespace are present before the number in the String then return 0.\n5) If number is strictly greater than ((2 to the power 31) - 1), return ((2 to the power 31) - 1).\n6) If number is strictly less than (-2 to the power 31), return (-2 to the power 31).\n7) If input is something like (sign) number (sign) or (sign) number (sign) number, return the first sign and number. Here sign is either '+' or '-'.\n8) If the number present is decimal, i.e, there is point in it, just return the Integer Value.\n\nFor the solution covering all the edge cases, refer to: [My solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/solutions/2915211/simple-0ms-cpp-solution-beats-100/?orderBy=newest_to_oldest)\n\nIf I forgot to mention any edge case or if you have any Doubt, you can ask me in the Reply Section.\n\nDon't forget to upVote if it helped you :)"

In this problem there are multiple edge cases (which tbh are annoying) and the only way to learn about all the edges cases is by trial and error only because the requirements are not specified, or to be more accurate 'they are not specified properly'. I submitted code countless times and only then was able to figure out all the edgecases.\n\nLet's talk about a few i remember (there might be more than this, you can refer to [my solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/solutions/2915211/simple-0ms-cpp-solution-beats-100/?orderBy=newest_to_oldest) for that) :-\n\n1) Only ignore leading whitespaces when there is no '+' or '-' sign received.\n2) Only ignore the other characters when they are present after the number in the given String. If present before a number, then return 0.\n3) If received 2 signs continuosly or without a number in between then return 0.\n4) If characters other than whitespace are present before the number in the String then return 0.\n5) If number is strictly greater than ((2 to the power 31) - 1), return ((2 to the power 31) - 1).\n6) If number is strictly less than (-2 to the power 31), return (-2 to the power 31).\n7) If input is something like (sign) number (sign) or (sign) number (sign) number, return the first sign and number. Here sign is either '+' or '-'.\n8) If the number present is decimal, i.e, there is point in it, just return the Integer Value.\n\nFor the solution covering all the edge cases, refer to: [My solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/solutions/2915211/simple-0ms-cpp-solution-beats-100/?orderBy=newest_to_oldest)\n\nIf I forgot to mention any edge case or if you have any Doubt, you can ask me in the Reply Section.\n\nDon't forget to upVote if it helped you :)"

A recurring requirement in many problems seems to be that you work with 32 bit ints and handle overflow properly. Working in Python, I get no complaints if I simply create the required answer and only then check if its larger (or smaller) than (-)2^31 and cap it.\\n\\nI see many other Python programmers use this as well in their posted solutions. With the String to Int problem I finally started doing thing differently as I realise that using a 64 bit int and only then checking if it fits a 32 bit int is kind of besides the point. 2^31 is not some arbitrary limit, the question states your environment can only handle 32 bit ints so even if Python allows us to be lazy an interviewer would be right to mention that you didn\\'t read the question right and your code would cause errors. \\n\\nJust a tip to other Python programmers, I think it\\'s better to get used to properly checking for overflow even if it isn\\'t strictly required. It\\'s not that hard the method can be applied to any of these types of problems once you know it."

For example, in the cases you show you could reason about what could be the best behaviour, and at your job you should do that, but here you just have to follow the rules, so you parse the first sign simbol and afterwards you expect a digit, if there is something else than a digit, you should return zero.

These things are not allowed according to the problem description. Other issues are just misreading things, like it says to ignore leading whitespaces, but people ignore all whitespaces (a whitespace after a plus sign or between digits is not a leading whitespace and should not be ignored).

If it is a sign, remember the sign and remove it from the string. If it is a digit, assume it is positive.\\n\\nIterate over the remaining characters of the string until a non-digit character is encountered. While iterating, build the integer by multiplying the current value by 10 and adding the value of the current digit. If a non-digit character is encountered, break out of the loop.\\n\\nApply the sign (remembered in step 2) to the integer calculated in step 3.\\n\\nCheck if the final integer is within the range of a 32-bit signed integer, and clamp it if it is not.\\n\\nReturn the final integer."

For me, in english, it makes no sense.\\n\\nBased on what I know so far for this exercise and written in hopefully a good english grammar, the following is, in my opinion, a shorter, concise and much better description:\\n\\nImplement a function that receives a string of characters as an input. You\\'re checking if the very first prefix of the very first group of characters (aka s.split()[0]) has an integer in it. Ignore any leading whitespaces from the start of the string. Check if the first character is either \"-\" or \"+\" to know the sign of the integer you\\'re about to read. Consider that \"+\" is implied even if it\\'s not read. The next characters should be the integer you need to clamp inside a 32bit signed integer and return to the output. If you read any other character than a digit, the processing should end and you should return the integer you processed so far.\\n\\nOther examples:\\n\"      -a 42\" -> 0\\n\"      -42a 41\" -> -42\\n\" +42 55\" -> 42\\n\\n[Constraints here]\\n\\nA problem shouldn\\'t be difficult because it\\'s written in a poor form. Please work on making yourself understood in a much cleaner and concise form. And also, to make sure I\\'m not misunderstood, never make your description so short under the guidance of Kevin\\'s \"Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick\". Find a balance."
