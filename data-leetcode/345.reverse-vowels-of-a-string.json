We can\\'t always do the maximum jump at each index. This can be easily verified by looking at the example test cases.\\n\\nSo, at each position, we can use a jump size of anywhere in the range *`[1, nums[pos]]`*. The final answer will be the minimum jumps required. We can recursively solve this problem as -\\n\\n* If we reach index *`n-1`* return 0, signifying that we need 0 more jumps.\\n* Else recurse for each jump size possible from the current index and return the answer in which we require the minimum number of jumps\\n\\n\\n```\\nint jump(vector<int>& nums, int pos = 0) {\\n\\tif(pos >= size(nums) - 1) return 0;        \\n\\tint minJumps = 10001;  // initialising to max possible jumps + 1\\n\\tfor(int j = 1; j <= nums[pos]; j++)  // explore all possible jump sizes from current position\\n\\t\\tminJumps = min(minJumps, 1 + jump(nums, pos + j));        \\n\\treturn minJumps;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** **`O(N!)`**. At each index `i` we have `N-i` choices and we recursively explore each of them till end. So we require `O(N*(N-1)*(N-2)...1) = O(N!)`. \\n***Space Complexity :*** **`O(N)`**\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\u2714\\uFE0F ***Solution - II (Recursive Dynamic Programming - Memoization) [Accepted]***\\n\\nWe can see that for a given position, we are repeatedly calculating the same answer over and over again. The jumps required to reach for a given index on the path remains fixed and can be stored in *`dp`* array to avoid re-calculations.\\n\\nThe solution is similar as the brute force with just the change that we are storing the solutions for each *`pos`* and returning it if it is already calculated.\\n\\n```\\nint jump(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\tvector<int> dp(size(nums), 10001); // initialise all to max possible jumps + 1 denoting dp[i] hasn\\'t been computed yet\\n\\treturn solve(nums, dp, 0);\\n}\\n// recursive solver to find min jumps to reach end\\nint solve(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& dp, int pos) {\\n\\tif(pos >= size(nums) - 1) return 0;    // when we reach end, return 0 denoting no more jumps required\\n\\tif(dp[pos] != 10001) return dp[pos];    // number of jumps from pos to end is already calculated, so just return it\\n\\t// explore all possible jump sizes from current position. Store & return min jumps required\\n\\tfor(int j = 1; j <= nums[pos]; j++)\\n\\t\\tdp[pos] = min(dp[pos], 1 + solve(nums, dp, pos + j));        \\n\\treturn dp[pos];\\n}\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** **`O(N^2)`**\\n***Space Complexity :*** **`O(N)`**\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u2714\\uFE0F ***Solution - III (Iterative Dynamic Programming - Tabulation) [Accepted]***\\n\\nWe can solve this iteratively as well. For this, we start from the last index. We need 0 jumps from `nums[n-1]` to reach the end. We store this as *`dp[n - 1] = 0`* and then iteratively solve this for each previous index till the 0th index. Here *`dp[i]`* denotes minimum jumps required from current index to reach till the end.\\n\\n1. For each index, we explore all the possible jump sizes available with us. \\n2. The minimum jumps required to reach the end from the current index would be - **`min(dp[jumpLen])`**, where *`1 <= jumpLen <= nums[currentPostion]`*\\n\\n```\\nint jump(vector<int>& nums) {\\n\\tint n = size(nums);\\n\\tvector<int> dp(n, 10001);\\n\\tdp[n - 1] = 0;  // start from last index.

Everytime we will try to update *`lastJumpedPos`* to furthest possible reachable index - `maxReachable`.\\n\\nUpdating the `lastJumpedPos` separately from *`maxReachable`* allows us to maintain track of minimum *`jumps`* required. Each time `lastJumpedPos` is updated, ***`jumps`*** will also be updated and store the minimum jumps required to reach `lastJumpedPos` (On the contrary, updating `jumps` with `maxReachable` won\\'t give the optimal (minimum possible) value of jumps required). \\n\\nWe will just return it as soon as *`lastJumpedPos`* reaches(or exceeds) last index.\\n\\nWe can try to understand the steps in code below as analogous to those in BFS as -\\n\\n1. **`maxReachable = max(maxReachable, i + nums[i])`** : Updating the range of next level. Similar to  *`queue.push(node)`* step of BFS but here we are only greedily storing the max reachable index on next level.\\n\\n\\n2. **`i == lastJumpedPos`** :  When it becomes true, current level iteration has been completed.\\n3. **`lastJumpedPos = maxReachable`** : Set range till which we need to iterate the next level\\n4. **`jumps++`** : Move on to the next level.\\n\\n5. **`return jumps`** : The final answer will be number of levels in BFS traversal.\\n\\nFor eg. Take the example : `nums = [2,3,1,4,1,1,1,2]`.

If you like this solution or find it useful,* ***please upvote*** *this post.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Idea:***\\n\\nSince each element of our input array (**N**) represents the maximum jump length and not the definite jump length, that means we can visit any index between the current index (**i**) and **i + N[i]**. Stretching that to its logical conclusion, we can safely iterate through **N** while keeping track of the furthest index reachable (**next**) at any given moment (**next = max(next, i + N[i])**). We\\'ll know we\\'ve found our solution once **next** reaches or passes the last index (**next >= N.length - 1**).\\n\\nThe difficulty then lies in keeping track of how many jumps it takes to reach that point. We can\\'t simply count the number of times we update **next**, as we may see that happen more than once while still in the current jump\\'s range. In fact, we can\\'t be sure of the best next jump until we reach the end of the current jump\\'s range.\\n\\nSo in addition to **next**, we\\'ll also need to keep track of the current jump\\'s endpoint (**curr**) as well as the number of jumps taken so far (**ans**).\\n\\nSince we\\'ll want to **return ans** at the earliest possibility, we should base it on **next**, as noted earlier. With careful initial definitions for **curr** and **next**, we can start our iteration at **i = 0** and **ans = 0** without the need for edge case return expressions.\\n\\n - _**Time Complexity: O(N)** where N is the length of N_\\n - _**Space Cmplexity: O(1)**_\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Implementation:***\\n\\nThere are only minor differences in the code of all four languages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Javascript Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **72ms / 37.7MB** (beats 95% / 100%).\\n```javascript\\nvar jump = function(N) {\\n    let len = N.length - 1, curr = -1, next = 0, ans = 0\\n    for (let i = 0; next < len; i++) {\\n        if (i > curr) ans++, curr = next\\n        next = Math.max(next, N[i] + i)\\n    }\\n    return ans\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Python Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **16ms / 14.0MB** (beats 100% / 99%).\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def jump(self, N: List[int]) -> int:\\n        Nlen, curr, nxt, ans, i = len(N) - 1, -1, 0, 0, 0\\n        while nxt < Nlen:\\n            if i > curr:\\n                ans += 1\\n                curr = nxt\\n            nxt = max(nxt, N[i] + i)\\n            i += 1\\n        return ans\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Java Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 36.1MB** (beats 100% / 85%).\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int jump(int[] N) {\\n        int len = N.length - 1, curr = -1, next = 0, ans = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; next < len; i++) {\\n            if (i > curr) {\\n                ans++;\\n                curr = next;\\n            };\\n            next = Math.max(next, N[i] + i);\\n        };\\n        return ans;\\n    };\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***C++ Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 7.9MB** (beats 100% / 100%).\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int jump(vector<int>& N) {\\n        int len = N.size() - 1, curr = -1, next = 0, ans = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; next < len; i++) {\\n            if (i > curr) ans++, curr = next;\\n            next = max(next, N[i] + i);\\n        };\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

We need to reach them with minimum possible steps.**\\nThis means that from the start position, there can be one or many possible ways of jumps (traversing through multiple sets of indices) to reach the end point. Hence it will be initially necessary to have a data structure that stores the optimum number of jumps to reach any particular index. Since the constraints states that the input array length will be less than 1000 *(1 <= nums.length <= 1000)*, we create an output array of length 1000 *(ideally length of input array)* and maintain the minimum jumps required to reach each position.\\n\\n2. **All indices are unreachable initially.**\\nSince we start from the first position, it is impossible to reach all the other indices without making the first move. So all of them can be initialized with some maximum value *(1e9 or Integer.MAX_VALUE)*. However, since we are standing in the first position, it is reachable by default without making any move. Hence we initialize the value of the first index in the output array as 0.\\n\\n**CODE & EXPLANTION**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int jump(int[] nums) {\\n        int i,n,j;\\n        n=nums.length;\\n        int [] pre = new int[n];\\n        for(i=0;i<n;i++)\\n        {\\n            // Initialize all the index position with some max value to denote it is unreachable\\n            pre[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Make the first position value as 0 as it is the default place where we start\\n        pre[0] = 0;\\n\\t\\t// Main condition check goes here.\\n        for(i=0;i<n;i++)\\n        {\\n            for(j=i;j<=i+nums[i] && j<n;j++)\\n            {\\n                pre[j] = Math.min(pre[j], pre[i]+1);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return pre[n-1];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet\\'s try to understand the loop where the main condition check happens. Each value in the nums array specifies the jump that is possible to take from the current position. So if the value in the ith index is nums[i], then it is understandable that from **(ith) position to (i+nums[i])th position** *(i, i+1, i+2, ...., i+nums[i])*, it can be reached in a single jump. However as already mentioned, since a particular position can be reached from various other position, we need to store the minimum possible jump value to reach the position.\\n*pre[j] = Math.min(pre[j], pre[i]+1)*.\\n\\nBy filling it this way, we can naturally fill the way the last element is reached also and return the pre[n-1] value directly.\\n\\nThere goes around a popular saying that *\\'When one learns things right, he learns them only once\\'*. There could be many people (including me :P) who would have done hundreds of problems and still finds it difficult to crack the next one because of a gap in the understanding and ability to convert that into code. Lets make use of this post to address some basic intuitions and approaches along with constructing a solution for this problem.",

Stretching that to its logical conclusion, we can safely iterate through **N** while keeping track of the furthest index reachable (**next**) at any given moment (**next = max(next, i + N[i])**). We\\'ll know we\\'ve found our solution once **next** reaches or passes the last index (**next >= N.length - 1**).\\n\\nThe difficulty then lies in keeping track of how many jumps it takes to reach that point. We can\\'t simply count the number of times we update **next**, as we may see that happen more than once while still in the current jump\\'s range. In fact, we can\\'t be sure of the best next jump until we reach the end of the current jump\\'s range.\\n\\nSo in addition to **next**, we\\'ll also need to keep track of the current jump\\'s endpoint (**curr**) as well as the number of jumps taken so far (**ans**).\\n\\nSince we\\'ll want to **return ans** at the earliest possibility, we should base it on **next**, as noted earlier. With careful initial definitions for **curr** and **next**, we can start our iteration at **i = 0** and **ans = 0** without the need for edge case return expressions.\\n\\n - _**Time Complexity: O(N)** where N is the length of N_\\n - _**Space Cmplexity: O(1)**_\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Implementation:***\\n\\nThere are only minor differences in the code of all four languages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Javascript Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **72ms / 37.7MB** (beats 95% / 100%).\\n```javascript\\nvar jump = function(N) {\\n    let len = N.length - 1, curr = -1, next = 0, ans = 0\\n    for (let i = 0; next < len; i++) {\\n        if (i > curr) ans++, curr = next\\n        next = Math.max(next, N[i] + i)\\n    }\\n    return ans\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Python Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **16ms / 14.0MB** (beats 100% / 99%).\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def jump(self, N: List[int]) -> int:\\n        Nlen, curr, nxt, ans, i = len(N) - 1, -1, 0, 0, 0\\n        while nxt < Nlen:\\n            if i > curr:\\n                ans += 1\\n                curr = nxt\\n            nxt = max(nxt, N[i] + i)\\n            i += 1\\n        return ans\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Java Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 36.1MB** (beats 100% / 85%).\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int jump(int[] N) {\\n        int len = N.length - 1, curr = -1, next = 0, ans = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; next < len; i++) {\\n            if (i > curr) {\\n                ans++;\\n                curr = next;\\n            };\\n            next = Math.max(next, N[i] + i);\\n        };\\n        return ans;\\n    };\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***C++ Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **0ms / 7.9MB** (beats 100% / 100%).\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int jump(vector<int>& N) {\\n        int len = N.size() - 1, curr = -1, next = 0, ans = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; next < len; i++) {\\n            if (i > curr) ans++, curr = next;\\n            next = max(next, N[i] + i);\\n        };\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

This leads to our first solution:\\n```\\nfrom collections import deque\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def jump(self, nums):\\n        n = len(nums)\\n        visited, queue = [False for i in range(n)], deque()\\n        queue.append((0, 0))\\n        visited[0] = True\\n        while queue:\\n            pos, step = queue.popleft()\\n            if pos == n - 1:\\n                return step\\n            for jump in range(1, min(nums[pos] + 1, n - pos)):\\n                if not visited[pos + jump]:\\n                    queue.append((pos + jump, step + 1))\\n                    visited[pos + jump] = True\\n```\\nThis solution gets TLE with time complexity `O(n^2)`. Where is the bottleneck? We know the time complexity of the best solution could NOT be less than `O(n)` since we need to jump step by step in the case of [1, 1, 1, 1, ....., 1, 1]. For each position, do we really need to check its every possible next postion with 1 jump?  The answer is NO, because some of such positions have been visited.\\n\\nIn solution 1, we used a `visited` array to record these positions, but we actually can just ignore these positions and only consider the positions that have not been visited. Note that the visited positions are consecutive, which means if position `j + 1` has been visited, position `j` also has been visited. We can use a variable `maxVisitedPos` to keep tracking the largest position that has been visited. For the jump at a position, we just check the positions that are further than `maxVisitedPos`. As such, each position will be operated at most twice (append and popleft), which gives us `O(n)` complexity and we know there cannot be a better solution.\\n\\n```\\nfrom collections import deque\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def jump(self, nums):\\n        n, queue = len(nums), deque()\\n        queue.append((0, 0))\\n        maxVisitedPos = 0\\n        while queue:\\n            pos, step = queue.popleft()\\n            if pos == n - 1:\\n                return step\\n            for jump in range(maxVisitedPos - pos + 1, min(nums[pos] + 1, n - pos)):\\n                queue.append((pos + jump, step + 1))\\n                maxVisitedPos = pos + jump\\n```",

Everytime we will try to update *`lastJumpedPos`* to furthest possible reachable index - `maxReachable`.\\n\\nUpdating the `lastJumpedPos` separately from *`maxReachable`* allows us to maintain track of minimum *`jumps`* required. Each time `lastJumpedPos` is updated, ***`jumps`*** will also be updated and store the minimum jumps required to reach `lastJumpedPos` (On the contrary, updating `jumps` with `maxReachable` won\\'t give the optimal (minimum possible) value of jumps required). \\n\\nWe will just return it as soon as *`lastJumpedPos`* reaches(or exceeds) last index.\\n\\nWe can try to understand the steps in code below as analogous to those in BFS as -\\n\\n1. **`maxReachable = max(maxReachable, i + nums[i])`** : Updating the range of next level. Similar to  *`queue.push(node)`* step of BFS but here we are only greedily storing the max reachable index on next level.\\n\\n\\n2. **`i == lastJumpedPos`** :  When it becomes true, current level iteration has been completed.\\n3. **`lastJumpedPos = maxReachable`** : Set range till which we need to iterate the next level\\n4. **`jumps++`** : Move on to the next level.\\n\\n5. **`return jumps`** : The final answer will be number of levels in BFS traversal.\\n\\nFor eg. Take the example : `nums = [2,3,1,4,1,1,1,2]`.

Then all we need to do is to start from the zero index and do `ind = t[ind]` until we reach the ending point or bigger. \\n\\nWe can look at our process like this: what is the biggest index we can reach after say `i` jumps. Then if we have new index to traverse we update our range. For example for `nums = [2, 3, 0, 1, 4]` we have `t = [2, 4, 4, 4, 8]` and after `1` jump we can reach index `2` and after each new index processed we expand our window if we have bigger value than the end of window and increase total number of steps or we do not do anything.\\n\\n#### Complexity\\nTime complexity is `O(n)`, space is `O(n)` as well, it can be made `O(1)`, if we calculate cumulative maximum on the fly.\\n\\n#### Code\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def jump(self, nums):\\n        t = list(accumulate([i + num for i, num in enumerate(nums)], max))\\n        ind, q = 0, 0\\n        while ind < len(nums) - 1:\\n            ind = t[ind]\\n            q += 1\\n        return q\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

So initially we can think of brute force i.e recursive + backtracking then we can optimize using dp. So this is normally how to aproach the problem . There is no need to worry about greedy ..\\n-  Now after doing dp if we want like how the greedy will work for this we can give it some time and try to take it as a shortest path problem like we do in graph by bfs. In the similar way we can check at some level what can be the maximum jump we can take and we also check in between the maximum jump so far till curr_max (if there is some more we can get) . \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n**Greedy:** So In greedy we can take two pointers  [max_so_far , curr_maxi]\\n- Then we check one by one upto our curr maximum what can be maximum jump i.e max_so_far and after checking upto our curr_maxi we will upafte our curr_maxi with max_so_far and also we will incraese counter by 1 becuse 1 jump is taken .\\n- This will run upto our max_so_far become >=n-1 i.e end point so after that we will return the answer (no. of jumps till now).\\n- There are two  ways of doing greedy like shown below : First one seems like more bfs type but both are actually implicit bfs ,idea is same incremnet the level and check in curr level the  max jump we can take  and when max > n-1 we will return the no .of levels  till now.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:O(n)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n**Dynamic Programming O(n^2)**\\n```\\nint solve(vector<int>&arr,int ind,vector<int>&dp){\\n        if(ind>=arr.size()-1)return 0;\\n        if(dp[ind]!=10001)return dp[ind];\\n        for(int i=1;i<=arr[ind];i++){\\n            dp[ind]=min(dp[ind],1+solve(arr,i+ind,dp));\\n        }\\n        return dp[ind];\\n    }\\n    int jump(vector<int>& arr) {\\n        int n=arr.size();\\n        vector<int>dp(n+1,10001);\\n        return solve(arr,0,dp);\\n    }\\n```\\n**Greedy I**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int jump(vector<int>& arr) {\\n        int n=arr.size();\\n        if(n==1)return 0;\\n        int max_so_far=0,ans=0,maxi=0;\\n        int i=0;\\n        while(maxi-i+1>0){\\n           ans++;\\n            for(i;i<=maxi;i++){\\n                max_so_far=max(max_so_far,i+arr[i]);\\n                if(max_so_far>=n-1)return ans;\\n            }\\n            maxi=max_so_far;\\n        }\\n        return 0;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n**Greedy II**\\n```\\nint jump(vector<int>& arr) {\\n        int n=arr.size(),sum=0,c=0;\\n        if(n==1)return 0;\\n        int currFar=0,currEnd=0;\\n        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){\\n            currFar=max(currFar,arr[i]+i);\\n            if(i==currEnd){\\n                c++;\\n                currEnd=currFar;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return c;\\n    }\\n```",

                "content": "**Approach**: I solved the problem with greedy approach. For the last couple of days i was practicing and studying greedy aprroach heavily. This topic always bothered me. But after with enough study and practicing common greedy problems now i can detect which problems to tackle with greedy approach and device a way how to solve.\\n\\nMy approach for this particular problem is to get the indices from nums which **minimises the distance from the end.**\\n```\\n\\t\\t\\tint a = nums.length - (nums[i] + i);\\n            if(a<aMin){\\n                min = nums[i];\\n                pos = i;\\n                aMin = a;\\n            }\\n```\\nThis block of code achives this.\\n\\nOverall Code:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int jump(int[] nums) {\\n        if (nums.length <= 1) return 0;\\n        int max = nums[0];\\n        int i = 0;\\n        int count = 1;\\n        while (i <= nums.length) {\\n            if (i + max >= nums.length - 1) return count;\\n            int[] res = helper(nums, i + 1, i + max);\\n            max = res[0];\\n            i = res[1];\\n            count++;\\n        }\\n        return 0;\\n    }\\n    \\n     private int[] helper(int[] nums, int start, int end) {\\n        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n        int aMin = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n        int pos = -1;\\n        for (int i = end; i >=start ; i--) {\\n            int a = nums.length - (nums[i] + i);\\n            if(a<aMin){\\n                min = nums[i];\\n                pos = i;\\n                aMin = a;\\n            }\\n\\n        }\\n        return new int[]{min, pos};\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTime taken is 2ms. I think the TC is **O(N)**. Cause in the worst case this program can process an elment max two times. I cant find a worse case that in an elemnt will be processed multiple times. Can anyone help me here if am right or wrong here?\\n\\nNevertheless thanks everyone to the discuss channel contributers which helps me a lot to progress. <3",

                "content": "# Approach\\nGenerally, for problems consisting of subproblems, we can use the following approach find the optimal algorithm:\\n1. Write the most intuitive recursive backtracking algorithm\\n2. Memoize repeated work using top-down dynamic programming\\n3. Eliminate recursion by using bottom-up dynamic programming\\n4. Apply final tricks\\n\\nIn the end, this problem can be solved with a simple but hard-to-find greedy algorithm.\\n\\nLet\\'s walk through each step.\\n\\n\\n# Recursive Backtracking\\nAlright, so how to approach this problem? The most intuitive way is to, at each index, check every index you can go to. Then, consider every index you can go to from there. At the end, the candidate with the least indices is our answer. We can make an optimization by discarding any candidates of length greater than what we\\'ve already found to be the best, but this algorithm is still exponential.\\n```\\n# Backtracking\\n# O(2^n) - Times out\\ndef jump0(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n    self.best = math.inf\\n    def backtrack(candidate, end):\\n        if candidate >= self.best:\\n            return\\n        if end <= 0:\\n            self.best = candidate\\n        for i in range(end)[::-1]:\\n            if nums[i] + i >= end:\\n                backtrack(candidate + 1, i)\\n\\n    backtrack(0, len(nums)-1)\\n    return self.best\\n```\\n\\n# Top-Down Dynamic Programming\\nClearly there is a lot of repeated work in the above algorithm. It calculates `backtrack(candidate + i, i)` for identical values of `candidate` and `i` repeatedly. By memoizing every result, we can bring the time complexity down to polynomial time, as the maximum number of iterations will be `candidate` (<=n) times `i` (=n).\\n```\\n# Memoized backtracking (Top-down DP)\\n# O(n^2) - Times out\\ndef jump00(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n    self.best = math.inf\\n    memo = {}\\n    def backtrack(candidate, end):\\n        if (candidate, end) in memo:\\n            return memo[candidate, end]\\n        if candidate >= self.best:\\n            return\\n        if end <= 0:\\n            self.best = candidate\\n        for i in range(end)[::-1]:\\n            if nums[i] + i >= end:\\n                backtrack(candidate + 1, i)\\n\\n        memo[(candidate, end)] = self.best\\n        return memo[(candidate, end)]\\n\\n    backtrack(0, len(nums)-1)\\n    return self.best\\n```\\nNow we get to around test case 100 before timing out. Progress, but still not good enough.\\n\\n# Bottom-Up DP\\nThe input arrays are extremely large. If we want to pass, we need to eliminate recursion.\\n\\nLet\\'s make an observation about the top-down DP: we are memoizing values that do not need to be memoized. The key intuition here is that if we have a score for index_start and index_end, we need not recompute values in the middle. Why? Well, if we can get to a certain ending index, then we can necessarily get to every index before that too.\\n\\n```\\n# Bottom-Up DP\\n# O(nm) - Passes\\n#   * n = len(nums) = max # of jumps\\n#   * m = max(jumps) = max jump length\\n# At each jump, jump to the index that gives us the farthest possible next jump\\n# This works because even if the optimal next jump isn\\'t the farthest, it will be contained in range(farthest)\\n# Optimal jump will always be at an index less than or equal to the farthest possible jump\\n# dp[i+1] = max_i(nums[j]+j for j in range(dp[i]+1))\\ndef jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n    if len(nums) == 1: return 0\\n    dp = [0]\\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\\n        dp.append(max((nums[j]+j for j in range(dp[i]+1))))\\n        if dp[i+1] >= len(nums)-1:\\n            break\\n\\n    return len(dp) - 1\\n```\\n\\n\\nOur algorithm finally passes! Why is it so much faster than the one above? After converting to bottom-up, we see that this approach is actually greedy! \\n\\nLet\\'s do even better.\\n\\n# Final Greedy Solution\\nFinally, we can get rid of trivial repeated work in order to optimize to linear time and constant space.\\n\\nWhy loop from 0 each time? Just loop from the last farthest index, which is the end of the last jump. And why store all values of dp? We only need two at a time.\\n```\\n# Now the algorithm is O(n) time and O(1) space\\ndef jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n    if len(nums) == 1: return 0\\n    last = next = 0\\n    count = 1\\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\\n        temp = next\\n        next = max((nums[j]+j for j in range(last, next+1)))\\n        if next >= len(nums)-1:\\n            break\\n        count += 1\\n        last = temp\\n\\n    return count\\n```\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n). We effectively loop over the list twice. Once with the outer loop, and only once with the inner loop because it considers each value in nums only once due to it moving.\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1). We only keep track of 4 integers.\\n# Performance\\n![x](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/8a2c6528-eb64-42e8-af3d-22c166ede68b_1675047170.0640862.png)\\n",

The greedy approach fails if we jumps over an index with a huge jump capacity.\\n\\nThe first loop transforms the problem to one where the greedy approach does succeed. It does this by realizing that if `nums[i] < nums[i-1] - 1`, then jumping to index i  is never optimal (unless it is the last index), because jumping to index i-1 will allow a farther jump. So setting `nums[i] = nums[i-1]-1` does not change the minimal number of jumps required.

                "content": "My solution is based on the observation that if you can reach index `i`, then you are always able to reach index `i - 1` too (**proof:** think of the last jump taken to reach index `i`. If it was of length `1`, then you were already at index `i - 1`. If it was of length ` >= 2`, then you could have taken a 1-unit smaller jump to land on `i -1` instead of `i`). Furthermore, following the same reasoning, if you can reach index `i` in `w` jumps, you can also reach index `i-1` using no more than `w` jumps (but perhaps even less).\\n\\nLet `reach[i]` be the farthest you can reach in the next jump assuming you are able to reach index `i`. (Remember, if you can reach in `i` in `w` jumps, then you can also reach any smaller index in no more than `w` jumps).  Therefore, `reach[i]` is simply `max(k + nums[k])` for all `k` with `0 <= k <= i`). \\n\\nYou can precompute `reach[i]` in O(n) for all `i`'s. (Note that in my code I reuse `nums` to precompute it and avoid defining a new array to save some memory.)\\n\\nAfter that you just simulate the jumps, always reaching as far as you can until you reach the end.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {\\n      int n = nums.size();\\n      for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\\n        nums[i] = max(nums[i - 1], i + nums[i]);\\n      }\\n      int jumps = 0;\\n      for (int at = 0; at < n - 1; at = nums[at]) {\\n        jumps++;\\n      }\\n      return jumps;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Thus we have to explore all the possible ways to reach the end index in order to get minimum jumps. We will use recursion to explore all the possibilities, and then go on to the memoization and tabulation approaches.\\n\\n# Recursive Approach\\nWe will start with index 0, and will try every possible jump i.e. till nums[i] for index `i`, and count the ways (if possible) to reach end index. Here it may be possible that we land at an index greater than `n-1`, thus the base case will be `if(j>=nums.size()-1) return 0;`. \\nThe approach is simple, the possible steps from current index are `j=i+nums[i]`, we initialise `mini` to `1e7` a big number (not to INT_MAX to avoid overflow) and we explore all jumps possible from `i+1` to `j`, compare the jumps/steps achieved for each jump to mini, and store it if we get comparatively less jumps. In the end we return **res+1**, consider this example: `nums:[1,4]` this will return 0, but we know we need atleat 1 jump to reach destination, so we return **result+1**.\\n\\n```\\nint jump(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n=nums.size();\\n        if(n==1) return 0;\\n        return f(0,nums,dp)+1;\\n}\\n\\nint f(int i, vector<int>& nums){\\n    int j=i+nums[i];\\n    if(j>=nums.size()-1) return 0;\\n    \\n    int mini=1e7;\\n    for(int k=i+1;k<=j;k++){\\n        int steps=1+f(k,nums);\\n        mini=min(mini, steps);\\n    }\\n\\n    return mini;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n# Memoization\\nIn memoization we avoid repeating recursive calls, thus we declare a vector `dp` of size `n`. And as here we are taking the array to be of size n, there will be slight modification in the base case: `dp[n-1]=1`. Before computing just check if it is precomputed or not and before returning store the data in the data structure.\\n```\\nint jump(vector<int>& nums) {\\n    if(n==1) return 0;\\n    vector<int> dp(n, -1);\\n    return f(0,nums,dp)+1;\\n}\\n\\nint solve(int ind,vector<int>&nums,int minJump,vector<int>&dp){\\n    int f(int i, vector<int>& nums, vector<int> &dp){\\n        int j=i+nums[i];\\n        if(j>=nums.size()-1) return 0;\\n\\n        if(dp[i]!=-1) return dp[i];\\n        \\n        int mini=1e7;\\n        for(int k=i+1;k<=j;k++){\\n            int steps=1+f(k,nums,dp);\\n            mini=min(mini, steps);\\n        }\\n\\n        return dp[i]=mini;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n# Tabulation\\nThere are 3 rules for tabulation: \\n1. Write the base cases.\\n2. Reverse the looping of the changing params.\\n3. Copy the recurrence relation.\\n\\nBase case will be `dp[n-1]=0`, and the *i* loop will run from `n-2` to `0` and we copy the recurrence relation.\\n\\n## Example\\nConsider nums to be [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]\\n- Start from the second-to-last position(n-2), \\n- At i=3, j=i+nums[i] = 3+1 = 4. We can jump to position 4. Now, we need to find the minimum jumps from positions 4.\\n- At i=2, j = i+nums[i] = 2+1 = 3. We can jump to position 3 or 4.\\n- The minimum jumps needed from position 3 is dp[3] = 0 (already known). The minimum jumps needed from position 4 is dp[4] = 0 (last index, no jumps needed). Since there\\'s only one jump needed from position 3 to position 4, the minimum jumps needed from position 2 is Update dp[2] = 1.\\n- At i=1, j = i+nums[i] = 1+3 = 4. We can jump to position 4.The minimum jumps needed from position 4 is dp[4]=0 (last index, no jumps needed).Since there\\'s only one jump needed from position 1 to position 4, the minimum jumps needed from position 1 is 1+1 = 2 Update dp[1]=2.\\n- At i=0, j = i+nums[i] = 0+2 = 2. We can jump to position 2. The minimum jumps needed from position 2 is dp[2]=1. Since there\\'s only one jump needed from position 0 to position 2, the minimum jumps needed from position 0 is 1+2=3. Update dp[0]=3. \\n- The dp array is now [3, 2, 1, 1, 0]. \\n- The minimum jumps needed to reach the last index (starting from position 0) is dp[0] = 3.\\n\\n**In the iterative version, the dp array correctly represents the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index from each position. There\\'s no need to add +1 again at the end because the dp array already contains the correct count of jumps.**\\n\\n\\n```\\nint jump(vector<int>& nums) {\\n    //O(n)\\n    //O(n)\\n    int n=nums.size();\\n    if(n==1) return 0;\\n    vector<int> dp(n, 0);\\n    dp[n-1]=0;\\n\\n    for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--){\\n        int j=min(n-1,i+nums[i]);\\n        int mini=1e7;\\n        for(int k=i+1;k<=j;k++){\\n            int steps=1+dp[k];\\n            mini=min(mini, steps);\\n        }\\n\\n        dp[i] = mini;\\n    }\\n\\n    return dp[0]+1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nUpvote if u liked :)\\n",

Update farthest as the maximum of the current farthest value and the sum of the current element nums[i] and the current index i. This is because we can reach nums[i] + i from index i.\\nb. Check if we have reached the current boundary current, which means we need to make the next jump. If i equals current, update current to the current value of farthest (as it represents the farthest index reachable from the previous jump), and increment the jump count.\\nAfter processing all elements, return the final value of jump, which represents the minimum number of jumps to reach the last index.\\nComplexity Analysis:\\n\\n# Time Complexity:\\n The algorithm iterates through the nums array once, performing constant time operations at each step. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums.\\n# Space Complexity:\\n The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space to store the variables farthest, current, and jump, so the space complexity is O(1).\\nOverall, the algorithm has a linear time complexity of O(n) and a constant space complexity of O(1).

The idea is to iteratively update the current farthest index that can be reached from each index, while keeping track of the current end index. Whenever the current index reaches the current end index, it means we have reached the maximum position we can jump from the previous indices. In that case, we increment the jump count and update the current end index to the current farthest index. By doing this, we move forward in the vector and continue the process until we reach the last index.\\n\\nThe intuition behind this approach is that by greedily selecting the farthest index we can reach at each step, we can optimize the number of jumps needed to reach the end. This is based on the observation that if we can reach a certain index, we can also reach all the indices before it. Therefore, we can keep track of the current farthest index and update it whenever we find a farther index to jump to.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n$$O(n)$$\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n$$O(1)$$\\n# Easily Understandable Code\\n```\\n-int jump(vector<int> &nums)\\n-{\\n-    int n = nums.size();\\n-    if (n == 1)\\n-        return 0;\\n-    int left = 0, right = 0;\\n-    int jump = 0;\\n-    while (right < n - 1)\\n-    {\\n-        int farthest = 0;\\n-        for (int i = left; i < right + 1; ++i)\\n-            farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i]);\\n-        left = right + 1;\\n-        right = farthest;\\n-        ++jump;\\n-    }\\n-    return jump;\\n-}\\n```\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution\\n{\\npublic:\\n// This function calculates the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index \\n// of the input vector.\\n\\nint jump(vector<int>& nums) {\\n    \\n    // Store the size of the input vector.\\n    int n = nums.size();\\n    \\n    // Declare and initialize variables for jumps, current end index, and current farthest index.\\n    int jumps = 0, currEnd = 0, currFarthest = 0;\\n    \\n    // Loop through the vector until the second to last element.\\n    for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\\n        \\n        // Calculate the farthest index we can reach from the current index.\\n        currFarthest = max(currFarthest, i + nums[i]);\\n        \\n        // If we reach the current end index, we need to jump to the next furthest index.\\n        if(i == currEnd) {\\n            jumps++;\\n            currEnd = currFarthest;\\n        }\\n    } \\n    \\n    // Return the number of jumps required to reach the last index.\\n    return jumps;\\n}\\n};\\n```\\n",

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0].

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

Therefore bigger the number the better, it means more choice.\\n\\nFor example:\\nnum[2] = 3, num[3] = 5.\\nIf you can choose between jump to idex 2 or 3, then you should jump to index 3.

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

However, taking this minimum requires k operations, and since k is an int, then computing this for the entire array can take **O(N^2)** time since the span of elements over which we take the minimum could go to the end of the memo.\\n\\nThere is a data structure called [segment tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-range-minimum-query/), that given some array, A[i], allows computations of min{A[i],...,A[j]) in O(Log N) time rather than O(N).  It also allows updates of A[i] in O(Log N) time.\\n\\nConsider this with nums = [2,3,1,1,4].\\nInitially the memo MinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,0].\\nWe now build our segment tree off of this memo;\\nFor i = 3 (second-to-last element), we calculate minimum{memo[4]} = minimum{0} = 0, to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,\\u221E,1,0]. Then we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 1.\\nFor i = 2, we calculate minimum{memo[3]} = minimum{1} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,\\u221E,2,1,0]. Again we update the segment tree with the \\u221E becoming 2.\\nFor i = 1, we calculate minimum{memo[2],memo[3],memo[4]} = minimum{2,1,0} = 0, to get \\nMinJumpsToEnd = [\\u221E,1,2,1,0]. Update segment tree.\\nLastlt for i = 0, we calculate minimum{memo[1],memo[2]} = minimum{1,2} = 1 to get\\nMinJumpsToEnd = [2,1,2,1,0] and return 2.\\n\\nThe point is that we keep the segment tree accurate at each step to allow the potentially linear time calculation of minimum{...} to take place in Log N time instead.\\n\\n*Don\\'t do this since there is an O(N) solution.  This is just to demonstrate how you can do a DP solution in better than O(N^2) time.*"

Rather, you can **CHOOSE** to jump 1. 2. 3....*x* spaces.\\n\\nTherefore, suppose *num[i] < num[j*] and  *i< j*, then simply jump to *num[j]* if given the choice, since *num[j]* can cover all the positition coverd by *num[i]*. Therefore bigger the number the better, it means more choice.\\n\\nFor example:\\nnum[2] = 3, num[3] = 5.\\nIf you can choose between jump to idex 2 or 3, then you should jump to index 3. Because index 2 can jump to index 3, 4, 5, while index 3 can jump to 4, 5, 6, 7.\\n\\nIn conclusion: The problem can be solved using this simple greedy algorithm. The key to improving run speed of the solution is to realize that when choosing which index to jump to, always pick the the one that gives the maximum possible distance, which is given by ***index + num[index]***"

For example, even if nums[i] is 50, nums[i+1] still needs to be evaluated as it could be 10000.\nConsidering these factors, it appears that the algor[i](https://yumzlab.com/collections/mushroom-gummies-amanita-muscaria)thm would need to execute 5000 steps, with each step considering 5000 nodes. This suggests an O(n^2) behavior rather than O(n). Did I overlook something?\n\nI acknowledge that this is a contrived input I created through adversarial thinking. However, if I recall correctly, big O notation represents the \"worst-case\" scenari"

                "content": "Morris Traversal is a way of traversing BST with O(1) space and O(n) time. It's a little hard to understand but the basic idea is to link predecessor back to current node so that we can trace back to top of BST. It's also a little tricky to see how it is O(n) since finding predecessor is often O(logn). The answer is , we don't have to find predecessor for every node, only the nodes with valid left child. It will be obvious if you draw a tree to see that every edge is only visited constant time.\\n\\nInorder\\n\\n```\\n    def inorderTraversal(self, root):\\n        result=[]\\n        node=root\\n        while node!=None:\\n            if node.left==None:\\n                result.append(node.val)\\n                node=node.right\\n            else:\\n                pre=node.left\\n                while pre.right!=None and pre.right!=node:\\n                    pre=pre.right\\n                if pre.right==None:\\n                    pre.right=node\\n                    node=node.left\\n                else:\\n                    pre.right=None\\n                    result.append(node.val)\\n                    node=node.right\\n        return result\\n```\\n\\nPreorder, basically the same, just one line of change\\n```\\n    def preorderTraversal(self, root):\\n        result=[]\\n        node=root\\n        while node!=None:\\n            #print(node.val)\\n            if node.left==None:\\n                result.append(node.val)\\n                node=node.right\\n            else:\\n                pre=node.left\\n                while pre.right!=node and pre.right!=None:\\n                    pre=pre.right\\n                if pre.right==None:\\n                    result.append(node.val)\\n                    pre.right=node\\n                    node=node.left\\n                else:\\n                    pre.right=None\\n                    node=node.right\\n        return result\\n```\\n\\nPostorder, this is a little tricky, you have to output path along predecessor in reverse order. \\n```\\n    def postorderTraversal(self, root):\\n        result=[]\\n        def reverseOrder(left,right):\\n            while left<right:\\n                result[left],result[right]=result[right],result[left]\\n                left+=1\\n                right-=1\\n        dummynode= TreeNode(None) #dummy node\\n        node=dummynode\\n        node.left=root\\n        while node!=None:\\n            print(node.val)\\n            if node.left==None:\\n                node=node.right\\n            else:\\n                pre=node.left\\n                while pre.right!=None and pre.right!=node:\\n                    pre=pre.right\\n                if pre.right==None:\\n                    pre.right=node\\n                    node=node.left\\n                else:\\n                    pre=node.left\\n                    count=1\\n                    while pre.right!=None and pre.right!=node:\\n                        result.append(pre.val)\\n                        pre=pre.right\\n                        count+=1\\n                    result.append(pre.val)\\n                    pre.right=None\\n                    reverseOrder(len(result)-count,len(result)-1)\\n                    node=node.right\\n                    \\n        return result\\n```",

                "content": "Here I provide a very straightforward and general way to transform recursion into iterative code. This works especially well for dummies like me.\\n\\nAs we know, the recursion code is very easy to write\\n```\\n    void recursion(TreeNode * cur, vector<int> & result) {\\n        if (cur->left) recursion(cur->left);        // line 0\\n        if (cur->right) recursion(cur->right);      // line 1\\n        result.push_back(cur->val);                 // line 2\\n        return;                                     // line 3\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nThe difficulty is to write the iterative version of such code. I fully mimic the function call stacks. I maintain two stacks: variable stack and pc stack (pc stands for programming counter). Here the variable stack maintains the value of each variable of each function call in the recursion. The pc stack stores the **line of code that is to be executed in each corresponding function**\\n\\nThe entry point in the recursion code is to call recursion(root) function. Hence, in the iterative version of the code, we push root to the variable stack, and 0 to the pc stack. This means that the first line (line 0) of recursion(root) function is to be executed.\\n\\nThen I execute the following loop until the stack is empty.\\n1. Inspect the top of the pc stack. Then increment the top of pc stack, which means that the current line of code has been executed.\\n2. If pc == 0, push the left child of the top of the variable stack to the stack if such child exists. Also push 0 to the pc stack.\\n3. If pc == 1, push the right child of the top of the variable stack to the stack if such child exists. Also push 0 to the pc stack.\\n4. if pc == 2, append the value of the top of the variable stack to the result.\\n5. If pc == 3, pop both variable and pc stack.\\n\\nYou can find pc here fully corresponds to the line number in the previous recursion code! \\n\\nThe complete code is following.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\\n        stack<TreeNode *> varStack;\\n        stack<int> PCStack;\\n        vector<int> result;\\n        if (!root) return result;\\n        varStack.push(root);\\n        PCStack.push(0);\\n        while (!varStack.empty()) {\\n            TreeNode * cur = varStack.top();\\n            int pc = PCStack.top();\\n            PCStack.top()++;\\n            if (pc == 0) {\\n                // line 0: if (cur->left) recursion(cur->left); \\n                if (cur->left) {\\n                    varStack.push(cur->left);\\n                    PCStack.push(0);\\n                }\\n            }\\n            else if (pc == 1) {\\n                // line 1: if (cur->right) recursion(cur->right); \\n                if (cur->right) {\\n                    varStack.push(cur->right);\\n                    PCStack.push(0);\\n                }\\n            }\\n            else if (pc == 2) {\\n                // line 2: result.push_back(cur->val);\\n                result.push_back(cur->val);\\n            }\\n            else if (pc == 3) {\\n                // line 3: return\\n                varStack.pop();\\n                PCStack.pop();\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return result;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nYes it is LONG. But it is extremely easy to write, since you are simply simulating how the computer does for recursion.\\n\\nThe most **amazing** part of such method is that, it works for all recursions!!! I think that it also shows your understanding of call stacks if you analyze recursion in such a straightforward way.",

When we find a `nullptr` on the top of the stack, it means that all children nodes of a node (which is under the current `nullptr`) has been visited. So we can pop it (and of course, the mark `nullptr`).\\n\\n### Code\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {\\n        stack<TreeNode*> stk;\\n        if(root)stk.push(root);\\n        vector<int> ans;\\n        while(stk.size())\\n        {\\n            auto p = stk.top();\\n            //All children nodes are visited\\n            if(p == nullptr)\\n            {\\n                stk.pop();\\n                ans.push_back(stk.top()->val);\\n                stk.pop();\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n            //Use nullptr to mark parent node\\n            stk.push(nullptr);\\n            //last in first out\\n            if(p->right)stk.push(p->right);\\n            if(p->left)stk.push(p->left);\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "I have checked many implementations of iterative solutions to this problem; many of them seem to be rather verbose. After some investigations, I have come up with this following solution:\\n\\n    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode *root) {\\n        stack<TreeNode*> s;\\n        TreeNode* cur = root;\\n        vector<int> temp;\\n        while(true)\\n        {\\n            if (cur == NULL)  // If the current branch is finished, then go back to the most recent unvisited branch\\n            {\\n                if (!s.empty()) {cur = s.top(); s.pop(); continue;} // Checked the first unvisited branch\\n                else break;\\n            }\\n            temp.push_back(cur->val); // Add the current value to the FRONT of list\\n            s.push(cur->left);         // Push the left child to the stack\\n            cur = cur->right;          // Go the right child\\n        }\\n        // Don't forget to reverse the 'right-to-left' pre-order traversal!\\n        return vector<int>(temp.rbegin(), temp.rend()); \\n    }\\n\\nThe idea is to exploit the fact that Post-order Traversal is equivalent to the REVERSE of a 'right-to-left' (i.e. traverse the right children then the left ones) pre-order traversal. For example, for the following tree:\\n\\n           A\\n          / \\\\\\n         B   C\\n        / \\\\\\n       D   E\\n\\npost-order: D E B C A\\n\\n'right-to-left' pre-order: A C B E D \\n\\nAs for the pre-order traversal, we initialize the current node to the root. Then we keep adding the value of the current node to the traversal list, and then push its left child to a stack, and set its right child as the current node.

                "code": "I have checked many implementations of iterative solutions to this problem; many of them seem to be rather verbose. After some investigations, I have come up with this following solution:\\n\\n    vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode *root) {\\n        stack<TreeNode*> s;\\n        TreeNode* cur = root;\\n        vector<int> temp;\\n        while(true)\\n        {\\n            if (cur == NULL)  // If the current branch is finished, then go back to the most recent unvisited branch\\n            {\\n                if (!s.empty()) {cur = s.top(); s.pop(); continue;} // Checked the first unvisited branch\\n                else break;\\n            }\\n            temp.push_back(cur->val); // Add the current value to the FRONT of list\\n            s.push(cur->left);         // Push the left child to the stack\\n            cur = cur->right;          // Go the right child\\n        }\\n        // Don't forget to reverse the 'right-to-left' pre-order traversal!\\n        return vector<int>(temp.rbegin(), temp.rend()); \\n    }\\n\\nThe idea is to exploit the fact that Post-order Traversal is equivalent to the REVERSE of a 'right-to-left' (i.e. traverse the right children then the left ones) pre-order traversal. For example, for the following tree:\\n\\n           A\\n          / \\\\\\n         B   C\\n        / \\\\\\n       D   E\\n\\npost-order: D E B C A\\n\\n'right-to-left' pre-order: A C B E D \\n\\nAs for the pre-order traversal, we initialize the current node to the root. Then we keep adding the value of the current node to the traversal list, and then push its left child to a stack, and set its right child as the current node. That way, each element in the stack represents the root of a branch that we should visit at later time, with the top element being the first one that we visit as soon as we get the chance to.\\n\\nIf we find the current node is NULL, it means we have reached the end of a branch, then we should visit a new branch beginning at the top of the stack. If the top element of the stack is also NULL, it means this branch does not contain anything, then we should pop it out, then check the new top element until it is no longer NULL. If the stack turns empty before we find a non-NULL node in it, then we have visited all the nodes in the tree.\\n \\nAnd it boils down to this simple iterative rule:\\n\\n------------\\n\\nIn each iteration\\n\\n1. If the current node is not NULL, then \\n\\n  A) add its value to the traversal list, and \\n\\n  B) push its LEFT child to stack, and \\n\\n  C) go to its RIGHT child. \\n\\n2. If the current node is NULL, then set the current node to the top of the stack (terminate if the stack is already empty).\\n\\n-------------\\n\\n Implementation-wise, this is the most concise solution I have come up so far.

In fact, the remaining context state here is the information of the **right child** of the previous node. We can use stack to keep this information.\\n\\n---\\n**InOrder**\\n```java\\npublic List<Integer> inorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\\n    List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();\\n    Deque<TreeNode> fa = new LinkedList<>();\\n    TreeNode p = root;\\n    while(!fa.isEmpty() || p != null){\\n        if(p != null) {\\n            fa.push(p);\\n            p = p.left;\\n        } else {\\n            TreeNode top = fa.pop();\\n            ans.add(top.val);\\n            p = top.right;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return ans;\\n}\\n```\\nFor inorder traversal, the information retained by the node at the previous level is actually its **value** and **right child**, so the parent node can be kept in the stack.\\n\\n---\\n**PostOrder**\\n```java\\npublic List<Integer> postorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\\n    List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();\\n    Deque<TreeNode> fa = new LinkedList<>();\\n    TreeNode p = root;\\n    TreeNode lastReturn = null;\\n    while(!fa.isEmpty() || p != null) {\\n        if(p != null) {\\n            fa.push(p);\\n            p = p.left;\\n        } else {\\n            if(fa.peek().right == null || lastReturn == fa.peek().right) {\\n                ans.add(fa.peek().val);\\n                lastReturn = fa.pop();\\n            } else {\\n                p = fa.peek().right;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return ans;\\n}\\n```\\nThe postorder traversal is a little more complicated, because the value and the right child information of the node of previous layer are to be retained, and the **value** is to be retained until the end. Therefore, when `p==null`, it is not possible to determine whether the right subtree of the parent has been traversed, but only after the right subtree has been traversed, the value of the parent can be output. So we\\'re going to record the last node that popped up,` lastReturn`, and if it\\'s equal to the right child of the parent, that means that the right subtree has been traversed, that parent can be safely popped up, and `lastReturn` is equal to the popped up node. \\n\\n**Discussion**\\nWhy don\\'t we worry about this when we use recursive method?\\nBecause at the time of recursion, stack frame will automatically record the context information of the function, including the program execution to which step. But in our \"stack\", we simply recorded the information of the node (the value and right subtree). So we don\\'t know we execute to which step. We need to make some special judgments to know where we are currently executing.",

The algorithm starts by adding the root node to the stack. Then, while the stack is not empty, it pops the next node from the stack, appends its value to the result list, and adds its left and right children to the stack (if they exist). Finally, the result list is reversed and returned as the final output.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def postorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:\\n        if not root:\\n            return []\\n        \\n        stack = [root]\\n        result = []\\n        \\n        while stack:\\n            node = stack.pop()\\n            result.append(node.val)\\n            if node.left:\\n                stack.append(node.left)\\n            if node.right:\\n                stack.append(node.right)\\n        \\n        return result[::-1]\\n\\n```",

All the three very famous tree traversals i.e preOrder, postOrder and inOrder can be solved with the help of stack data structure. In this post i\\'ll try to explain what similarities they have in common.\\n\\n<b>Consider out tree looks like this:</b>\\n```\\n\\t\\t   \\t1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t2      3\\n```\\n\\nThe preOrder traversal  will be ( Root - Left - Right ) : 1 2 3\\nThe postOrder traversal will be ( Left - Right - Root ) : 2 3 1\\nThe inOrder traversal will be ( Left - Root - Right ) : 2 1 3\\n\\nA simple technique to remember is that the answer lies in the name actually, like in case of <b>in</b>Order, the in will simply mean in-between and hence the Root is in between the left and right subtree, similarly in case of <b>pre</b>Order, the pre will imply before the left and right and hence the root is before, same goes for the postOrder.\\n\\n<b>Recursive Solution</b>\\n\\nThe recursive approach is probably lot easier to write in code as recursion handles all the good work which normally people don\\'t dry-run.\\n\\n<b>postOrder</b>\\n```\\n private static void postOrder(TreeNode root){\\n        if(root == null) return;\\n        postOrder(root.left);\\n        postOrder(root.right);\\n        System.out.print(root.val+\" \");\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n<b>preOrder</b>\\n```\\n private static void preOrder(TreeNode root){\\n        if(root == null) return;\\n        System.out.print(root.val+\" \");\\n        preOrder(root.left);\\n        preOrder(root.right);\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n<b>inOrder</b>\\n```\\n private static void inOrder(TreeNode root){\\n        if(root == null) return;\\n        inOrder(root.left);\\n        System.out.print(root.val+\" \");\\n        inOrder(root.right);\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nYou can easily notice, that the only notable difference between them is the positioning of the print statement which basically denotes the root node.\\n\\n<b>Iterative Solutions</b>\\n\\n<b>postOrder</b>\\nIn case of postOrder we need to make use of two stacks, we first insert the root of node of the tree in stack1, then we push this node to the stack2 following with the check for the left subtree node and insert that node first and then for the right substree one.\\n\\n```\\npublic List<Integer> postorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\\n        List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();\\n        if(root == null) return list;\\n        Stack<TreeNode> stack1 = new Stack<>();\\n        Stack<TreeNode> stack2 = new Stack<>();\\n        stack1.push(root);\\n        while(!stack1.isEmpty()){\\n            TreeNode node = stack1.pop();\\n            stack2.push(node);\\n            if(node.left!=null) stack1.push(node.left);\\n            if(node.right!=null) stack1.push(node.right);\\n        }\\n        while(!stack2.isEmpty()){\\n            TreeNode node = stack2.pop();\\n            list.add(node.val);\\n        }\\n        return list;\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n<b>preOrder Iterative</b>\\nQuite simple actually, just use the LIFO property of stack, and insert the right node first then the left subtree node and you are done.\\n\\n```\\npublic List<Integer> preorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\\n        List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();\\n        if(root == null) return list;\\n        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();\\n        stack.push(root);\\n        while(!stack.isEmpty()){\\n            TreeNode node = stack.pop();\\n            list.add(node.val);\\n            if(node.right!=null) stack.push(node.right);\\n            if(node.left!=null) stack.push(node.left);\\n        }\\n        return list;\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n<b>inOrder Iterative</b>\\nTricky! Traverse as left as you can, then consider print the leftmost then print the root and then check for the right subtree and then again go to the left subtree.\\n\\n```\\npublic List<Integer> inorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\\n        List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();\\n        if(root == null) return list;\\n        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();\\n        while(root!=null){\\n            stack.push(root);\\n            root = root.left;\\n        }\\n        while(!stack.isEmpty()){\\n            TreeNode node = stack.pop();\\n            list.add(node.val);\\n            if(node.right!=null){\\n                node = node.right;\\n                while(node!=null){\\n                    stack.push(node);\\n                    node = node.left;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return list;\\n    }\\n```\\nHope this helps!",

And it requires lots of effort to ensure a bug-free implementation. \\n\\nFor better interview purpose, I would like to share my template that works uniformly for pre-order, in-order and post-order traversals. It is easily memorizable, and you can simply write it down in the whiteboard on spot.  \\n\\nThe idea is still to use a Stack to keep the traverse path. The trick in the template is to keep track of the occurances of a node. Depending the occurance, we know if it is ready to be popped for post-order, in-order, and pre-order. Below is the template:\\n\\n```\\n@AllArgsConstructor\\n class Pair {\\n        TreeNode treeNode;\\n        int visited;\\n }\\n\\n public void treeTraverse(TreeNode root) {\\n        Deque<Pair> stack = new LinkedList<>();\\n        stack.push(new Pair(root, 0));\\n\\n        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {\\n            Pair top = stack.pop();\\n            if (top.treeNode == null) {\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n\\t\\t\\tif(top.visited == 2) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSystem.out.println(\"Both children has been processed\");\\n\\t\\t\\t} else if(top.visited == 1) {\\n\\t\\t\\t   System.out.println(\"Left children has been processed\");\\n\\t\\t\\t   top.visited++;\\n\\t\\t\\t   stack.push(node);\\n\\t\\t\\t   //do something\\n\\t\\t\\t} else {\\n              System.out.println(\"No children has been processed\");\\n\\t\\t\\t   top.visited++;\\n\\t\\t\\t   stack.push(node);\\n\\t\\t\\t   //do something\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n        }\\n    }\\n```\\nSo this template push a node at most three times, and based on its occurance, we can determine the state of the traverse.\\nThe simple rule is:\\n1. visited == 0,  no children has been processed, if we print current node, it is **pre-order** traversal\\n2. visited == 1, all left children has been processed, if we print current node, it is **in-order** traversal\\n3. visited == 2, all left and right children has been processed, if we print current node, it is **post-order** traversal.\\n\\nThe completed AC code for the three variants are as below. Although they are not the fastest implementation, but they are easy to remember and bug-free.\\n\\nPost-order:\\n```\\npublic List<Integer> postorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\\n        Deque<Pair> stack = new LinkedList<>();\\n        stack.push(new Pair(root, 0));\\n        List<Integer> ans = new LinkedList<>();\\n        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {\\n            Pair top = stack.pop();\\n            if (top.treeNode == null) {\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n            if (top.visited == 2) {\\n                ans.add(top.treeNode.val);\\n            } else if (top.visited == 1) {\\n                top.visited++;\\n                stack.push(top); \\n                stack.push(new Pair(top.treeNode.right, 0));\\n            } else {\\n                top.visited++;\\n                stack.push(top); \\n                stack.push(new Pair(top.treeNode.left, 0));\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nIn-order:\\n```\\n public List<Integer> inorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\\n        Deque<Pair> stack = new LinkedList<>();\\n        stack.push(new Pair(root, 0));\\n        List<Integer> ans = new LinkedList<>();\\n        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {\\n            Pair top = stack.pop();\\n            if (top.treeNode == null) {\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n            if (top.visited == 1) {\\n                ans.add(top.treeNode.val);\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstack.push(new Pair(top.treeNode.right, 0));\\n            } else {\\n                top.visited++;\\n                stack.push(top);\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstack.push(new Pair(top.treeNode.left, 0));\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nPre-order:\\n```\\npublic List<Integer> preorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\\n        Deque<Pair> stack = new LinkedList<>();\\n        stack.push(new Pair(root, 0));\\n        List<Integer> ans = new LinkedList<>();\\n        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {\\n            Pair top = stack.pop();\\n            if (top.treeNode == null) {\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n            if(top.visited == 0) { // it is not necessary for pre-order to have this check, but here is for the integrity of template\\n                ans.add(top.treeNode.val);\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstack.push(new Pair(top.treeNode.right, 0));\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstack.push(new Pair(top.treeNode.left, 0));\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nHope this would help you during the coding interview.\\n\\nP.S. In the above template, we only use one stack. Another benefit it can bring is to implement tree-iterators easily. The DFS solution in the reference solution does not provide such benefit. \\n\\n",

If we had visited 3, pop node 1 - remember last visited node 1 and pop it\\n3. **Right subtree was not visited**: visit right subtree\\n\\n```\\nstack = deque()\\nnode = root\\nlast_visited_node = None\\nwhile node or stack:\\n\\twhile node:\\n\\t\\tstack.append(node)\\n\\t\\tnode = node.left\\n\\t# no right subtree, right subtree was visited\\n\\tif stack[-1].right in [None, last_visited_node]:\\n\\t\\tres.append(stack[-1].val)\\n\\t\\tlast_visited_node = stack.pop()\\n\\t# right subtree was not visited\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tnode = stack[-1].right\\n\\nreturn res\\n```\\n\\nP.S.

First lets have a dummy node and make whole tree as left child of dummy node and make right child empty. [ why? Bec if we assume there is no right child of root then prinitng left child and then root become postorder traversal. Now what next? Are we finished, No... only performing inorder on new tree does not make any sense, it still printing inorder traversal of original tree followed by dummy node.\\n\\nNow closely observe inner else block, this the piece of code which require attention. Since this temporarily extended tree is the subject of traversal as in in-order traversal except that in the inner else clause, after finding a temporary parent, nodes between curr.left (included) and curr (excluded) extended to the right in a modified tree are processed in the reverse order. To process them in constant time, the chain of nodes is scanned down and right references are reversed to refer to parents of nodes. Then the same chain is scanned upward, each node is visited, and the right references are restored to their original setting.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public List<Integer> postorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\\n        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();\\n   //taking dummy node and assigning it\\'s left subtree to the original tree     \\n        TreeNode dummy = new TreeNode(-1);\\n        dummy.left = root;\\n        \\n        TreeNode curr = dummy;\\n        \\n        while(curr!=null) {\\n            if(curr.left == null){\\n\\t\\t\\t// If there is no left subtree then we are moving to right subtree\\n                curr = curr.right;\\n            } else{\\n                TreeNode pred = curr.left;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t//finding predeccsor of curr node\\n                while(pred.right != null && pred.right != curr){\\n                    pred = pred.right;\\n                }\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t// if predeccsor\\'s right was not pointing to curr then assigning it\\'s right to curr and moving left\\n                if(pred.right == null){\\n                    pred.right = curr;\\n                    curr = curr.left;\\n                }else{\\n                    TreeNode prev = curr;\\n                    TreeNode middle = prev.left;\\n                    // reversing the nodes between prev.left to pred (both incl)\\n                    while(middle != curr){\\n                       TreeNode last = middle.right;\\n                        middle.right = prev;\\n                        prev = middle;\\n                        middle = last;\\n                    }\\n                    // restoring the nodes between prev.left to pred (both incl) and adding them one by one to result list\\n                    middle = pred;\\n                    prev = curr;\\n                    while(middle != curr){\\n                        ans.add(middle.val);\\n                        TreeNode last = middle.right;\\n                        middle.right = prev;\\n                        prev = middle;\\n                        middle = last;\\n                    }\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                    pred.right = null;\\n                    curr = curr.right;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        dummy.left = null;\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nAt first glance, this is similar to iterative implementation of preorder and inorder traversal. \\n\\nWe use a stack to temporarily store the nodes that we\\'ve **not yet finished visiting**, and pop it off from stack when we ***fully finished*** visiting it. \\n\\nSince **postorder** traversal is defined as ***Left -> Right -> Root***,  we consider a node as being ***fully visited*** only after we finish visiting both its left and right subtree. \\n\\nInitially, when we encounter a node ```N```, we push it onto stack and start visiting its left subtree by moving as far left as possible. One important observation is that, the moment when we finish visiting ```N```\\'s left subtree, node ```N``` **must be on the stack top**. At this time, however, we\\'re not yet ready to pop it from stack since we haven\\'t visited its right subtree yet. \\nWe start visiting its right subtree. Once we\\'re done, node ```N``` **must appear on the stack top once again**. At this point, we know we\\'ve ***fully visited*** node ```N```, so we can pop it from stack and record its value in the result list. \\n\\nA problem is, when we see node ```N``` on the stack top (via ```stack.peek()```), how can we tell if this is the **first time** we see it (case 1, meaning we\\'ve just visited its left subtree, case 2), or the **second time** (case 2, meaning we\\'ve finishing visiting both its left and right subtree)? This is crucial to know, since:\\n- **Case 1**: we still need to continue visiting its right subtree, whereas\\n- **Case 2**: we can finish visiting it and pop it from stack.\\n\\nTo do so, we use a ```HashSet``` to keep track of the nodes that have been ***peeked***. Since the ```add()``` method of hashset returns false when the element we try to add is already in the set, we can exploit this fact to distinguish between case 1 and 2 when we peek a node from stack, and thus determine what to do next. \\n\\nThe illustration below may help understanding:\\n\\n```\\n     1\\n   /   \\\\\\n  2     3\\n / \\\\\\n.. ..\\n```\\n\\nImporant timestamps:\\n```\\n- t1: [1] //start visiting 1\\n- t2: [1 2] //push 2 (i.e., 1\\'s left child) onto stack\\n\\n... //move as far left as possible from 2\\n\\n- ta: [1 2 <left children of 2...>]\\n\\n... \\n\\n- tb: [1 2] //finish visiting left subtree of 2\\n            //note that 2 is on stack top\\n            //we add it to the set of peeked nodes (case 1)\\n\\n- t(b+1): [1 2 <right children of 2...>] //visiting right subtree of 2\\n\\n...\\n\\n- td: [1 2] //finish visiting right subtree of 2\\n            //note that 2 is on stack top again\\n            //we also find it in the peeked nodes set (case 2)\\n            //so we know we finished visiting it and pop it from stack\\n\\n- t(d+1): [1] \\n//continue to visit right subtree of 1...\\n...\\n```\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n1. Create an empty stack and a empty hashset.\\n2. Keep moving down to the left (```curr = curr.left```) and push ```curr``` node onto stack, until ```curr``` becomes null.\\n3. Peek the node on the stack top (```stack.peek()```)\\n    - If the node already exists in the peeked nodes set (```peeked.add(curr)``` returns false), pop it from stack and add it to the result list. Set ```curr = null``` to avoid revisiting the right subtree)\\n    - Else, add the node to the peeked set and start visiting its right subtree ```curr = curr.right```\\n\\n4. Repeat Step 2 and 3 while ```stack``` is not empty and ```curr``` is not ```null```.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: *O(n)*\\n\\n- Space complexity: *O(n)*\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n/**\\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\\n * public class TreeNode {\\n *     int val;\\n *     TreeNode left;\\n *     TreeNode right;\\n *     TreeNode() {}\\n *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }\\n *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {\\n *         this.val = val;\\n *         this.left = left;\\n *         this.right = right;\\n *     }\\n * }\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\n    \\n    public List<Integer> postorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {\\n          List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();\\n          Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();\\n          Set<TreeNode> peeked = new HashSet<>();\\n          TreeNode curr = root;\\n\\n          while (curr != null || !stack.isEmpty()) {\\n             //visiting the left subtree of node N\\n              while (curr != null) {\\n                  stack.push(curr);\\n                  curr = curr.left;\\n              }        \\n\\n              //at this point we\\'ve finished visiting the left subtree\\n              //of node N, and we\\'re sure N must be on the stack top \\n              //i.e., stack.peek() must return node N\\n              curr = stack.peek();\\n              \\n              //check if we\\'ve already visited the right subtree\\n              //of node N\\n              if (!peeked.add(curr)) {\\n              //right subtree of node N has already been visited, \\n              //meaning we\\'ve \"fully visited\" curr and can pop it \\n              //from stack and add its value to the result list\\n                  res.add(stack.pop().val);    \\n                  curr = null; //avoid revisiting the right subtree\\n              } else {\\n              //right subtree of N hasn\\'t been visited yet\\n              //so we start visiting it\\n                  curr = curr.right;\\n              }\\n          }\\n          return res;\\n    }\\n    \\n}\\n```",

Here I provide a simple version. It is very similar to the pre-order one, except that now we are doing everything reversely. By this I mean we go along the direction of right child and link the leftmost child on the right sub tree to the root. Then we leftappend the val to the result. \\n\\nTHAT`S IT!!\\n```\\ndef postorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:\\n\\t\\n\\tres = deque()\\n\\n\\twhile root:\\n\\t\\tif root.right:\\n\\t\\t\\ttemp = root.right\\n\\t\\t\\twhile temp.left and temp.left != root:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttemp = temp.left\\n\\t\\t\\tif not temp.left:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tres.appendleft(root.val)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttemp.left = root\\n\\t\\t\\t\\troot = root.right\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttemp.left = None\\n\\t\\t\\t\\troot = root.left\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tres.appendleft(root.val)\\n\\t\\t\\troot = root.left\\n\\n\\treturn res\\n```\\n\\nHope you like it.

As per your code you are pushing ROOT (which is 1) into STACK \n2. Try to iterate the STACK if its NOT EMPTY\n3. checking LEFT & RIGHT equals to NULL (condition FALSE -> as per the above tree)\n4. now checking if LEFT is NOT NULL (condition TRUE -> PUSH into STACK). \n5. now STACK is NOT EMPTY (has 2 & 1), loop starts once again\n6. checking LEFT & RIGHT equals to NULL (now condition is TRUE -> storing the 2 into result and POP from STACK)\n7. now STACK is NOT EMPTY (has 1), loop starts once again\n8. checking LEFT & RIGHT equals to NULL (condition FALSE -> as per the above tree)\n---here is why you are going wrong... you already processed LEFT node which is 2) there is no way to know 2 is processed so its going in infinite loop.\n\nIn step 3,6 & 8... you are using peek().\n\nI hope explanation is clear.

To achieve this, we can use two pointers technique: one pointer starting from the beginning of the string and another starting from the end. We will move these pointers towards each other, swapping the vowels they point to until they meet in the middle of the string.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Convert the input string s to an array of characters word. This step is necessary because strings are immutable in Java, and we need to modify the vowels\\' positions.\\n\\n1. Initialize two pointers, start and end, to the first and last characters of the string, respectively.\\n\\n1. Create a String variable vowels containing all the vowel characters (both lowercase and uppercase).\\n\\n1. Use a while loop to iterate until start is no longer less than end. This loop ensures that the pointers will not cross each other, and we process the characters in the middle of the string only once.\\n\\n**Inside the loop:**\\n1. Move the start pointer towards the end of the string until it points to a vowel character. We do this by using the indexOf method to find the index of the character in the vowels string. If the character is not a vowel, we keep moving the start pointer.\\n\\n1. Similarly, move the end pointer towards the beginning of the string until it points to a vowel character. Again, we use the indexOf method to check if the character is a vowel and keep moving the end pointer if it is not.\\n\\n1. Swap the vowels found at the start and end positions in the word array.\\n\\n1. Move the start pointer one step ahead and the end pointer one step back to continue searching for more vowels.\\n\\nAfter the loop finishes, the word array will contain the string with the reversed vowels. Convert the character array back to a String and return the result.\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time complexity of this solution is $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the input string s. The two pointers start and end move towards each other, and each character is processed once.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity of this solution is $$O(n)$$ because we create a character array word to store the characters of the input string. The space used is proportional to the length of the input string. Other than that, we use a constant amount of extra space for the vowels string and a few integer variables, which doesn\\'t depend on the input size.\\n\\n# Code\\n```java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public String reverseVowels(String s) {\\n        char[] word = s.toCharArray();\\n        int start = 0;\\n        int end = s.length() - 1;\\n        String vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\";\\n        \\n        while (start < end) {\\n            // Move start pointer until it points to a vowel\\n            while (start < end && vowels.indexOf(word[start]) == -1) {\\n                start++;\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Move end pointer until it points to a vowel\\n            while (start < end && vowels.indexOf(word[end]) == -1) {\\n                end--;\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Swap the vowels\\n            char temp = word[start];\\n            word[start] = word[end];\\n            word[end] = temp;\\n            \\n            // Move the pointers towards each other\\n            start++;\\n            end--;\\n        }\\n        \\n        String answer = new String(word);\\n        return answer;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n```python []\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def reverseVowels(self, s):\\n        # Convert the input string to a character array.\\n        word = list(s)\\n        start = 0\\n        end = len(s) - 1\\n        vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\\n        \\n        # Loop until the start pointer is no longer less than the end pointer.\\n        while start < end:\\n            # Move the start pointer towards the end until it points to a vowel.\\n            while start < end and vowels.find(word[start]) == -1:\\n                start += 1\\n            \\n            # Move the end pointer towards the start until it points to a vowel.\\n            while start < end and vowels.find(word[end]) == -1:\\n                end -= 1\\n            \\n            # Swap the vowels found at the start and end positions.\\n            word[start], word[end] = word[end], word[start]\\n            \\n            # Move the pointers towards each other for the next iteration.\\n            start += 1\\n            end -= 1\\n        \\n        # Convert the character array back to a string and return the result.\\n        return \"\".join(word)\\n```\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    string reverseVowels(string s) {\\n        // Convert the input string to a character array.\\n        string word = s;\\n        int start = 0;\\n        int end = s.length() - 1;\\n        string vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\";\\n        \\n        // Loop until the start pointer is no longer less than the end pointer.\\n        while (start < end) {\\n            // Move the start pointer towards the end until it points to a vowel.\\n            while (start < end && vowels.find(word[start]) == string::npos) {\\n                start++;\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Move the end pointer towards the start until it points to a vowel.\\n            while (start < end && vowels.find(word[end]) == string::npos) {\\n                end--;\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Swap the vowels found at the start and end positions.\\n            swap(word[start], word[end]);\\n            \\n            // Move the pointers towards each other for the next iteration.\\n            start++;\\n            end--;\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Return the modified string.\\n        return word;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n## ***Please Upvote my solution, if you find it helpful ;)***\\n![6a87bc25-d70b-424f-9e60-7da6f345b82a_1673875931.8933976.jpeg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/acf12ce9-4139-4e80-a219-5d02f3d054bf_1688572264.1963482.jpeg)\\n\\n",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nMy initial thoughts on solving this problem involve reversing the vowels in a given string while keeping the consonants and other characters in their original positions. To achieve this, I would iterate through the string using two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other from the end. When both pointers point to vowels, I will swap them to reverse the vowels.\\n\\n# Approach\\nI will start by converting the input string s into a character array to make it easier to manipulate. Then, I\\'ll initialize two pointers, start and end, pointing to the beginning and end of the string, respectively.\\n\\nI\\'ll use a while loop to traverse the string. In each iteration, I\\'ll use inner while loops to advance start and end until they point to vowels (or until start crosses end). When both pointers are on vowels, I\\'ll swap the characters at their positions to reverse the vowels. After the loop completes, I\\'ll return the modified character array as a string.\\n\\nTo determine whether a character is a vowel, I\\'ll define a helper function isVowel that checks if the character is one of the vowel characters (both lowercase and uppercase).\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because we traverse the string once with two pointers, and each character is examined only once.\\n\\nSpace complexity: The space complexity is O(n) as well, primarily due to the character array used to store the modified string.\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public String reverseVowels(String s) {\\n\\n        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();\\n\\n        int start = 0 ;\\n\\n        int end = s.length()-1;\\n\\n        while (start<end){\\n            while (start < end && !isVowel(chars[start])) {\\n                start++;\\n            }\\n\\n            while (start < end && !isVowel(chars[end])) {\\n                end--;\\n            }\\n\\n            if (start < end) {\\n                swap(chars, start, end);\\n                start++;\\n                end--;\\n            }\\n\\n        }\\n\\n        return new String(chars);\\n    }\\n\\n    private void swap(char[] word, int start, int end){\\n        char temp = word[start];\\n        word[start] = word[end];\\n        word[end] = temp;\\n    }\\n\\n    private boolean isVowel(char c) {\\n        return c == \\'a\\' || c == \\'e\\' || c == \\'i\\' || c == \\'o\\' || c == \\'u\\'\\n                || c == \\'A\\' || c == \\'E\\' || c == \\'I\\' || c == \\'O\\' || c == \\'U\\';\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n![87bab3dd-fabf-4b71-9ac5-984d9015438e_1678160362.0612018.jpeg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/8e036e7a-8854-4426-bf26-d01253a36b73_1694976337.0712368.jpeg)\\n",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nThe given problem is to reverse only the vowels in a given string. The vowels are \\'a\\', \\'e\\', \\'i\\', \\'o\\', and \\'u\\', and they can appear in both lower and upper case.\\n\\n\\n# Approach\\nThe provided solution uses a two-pointer approach to reverse the vowels in the string. It initializes two pointers, start and end, at the beginning and end of the string, respectively. It also creates a list, vowels, that contains all the vowels (both lowercase and uppercase).\\n\\nThe solution converts the input string into a list, s, for easier manipulation. It then enters a while loop that continues until the start pointer surpasses the end pointer. Inside the loop, it checks if the character at s[start] is a vowel. If it is, it enters another nested while loop that moves the end pointer towards the start until it finds a vowel at s[end]. This helps in finding the corresponding vowel from the end of the string to swap with the vowel at the start.\\n\\nOnce a vowel is found at both the start and end pointers, the solution swaps them by using a temporary variable, aux. After the swap, both pointers are adjusted accordingly. The end pointer moves towards the start, and the start pointer moves towards the end.\\n\\nFinally, after the while loop, the solution reconstructs the modified list, s, into a string, res, by iterating over each character in s and appending it to res. This modified string is then returned as the output.\\n\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n The solution iterates through the string using two pointers, so the while loop runs until the pointers meet or cross each other. This takes O(n/2) time, where n is the length of the string. The process of swapping the vowels takes constant time. The reconstruction of the modified list into a string also takes O(n) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(n).\\n\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe solution uses additional space to store the modified list, s, and the final string, res. Both have a maximum size of n, where n is the length of the input string. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def reverseVowels(self, word: str) -> str:\\n        start=0\\n        end=len(word)-1\\n        vowels= [\\'a\\', \\'e\\', \\'i\\', \\'o\\', \\'u\\',\\'A\\',\\'E\\',\\'I\\',\\'O\\',\\'U\\']\\n        s=[word[i] for i in range(len(word))]\\n        while start<end:\\n            if s[start] in vowels:\\n                while start<end and s[end] not in vowels:\\n                    end-=1\\n                aux=s[start]\\n                s[start]=s[end]\\n                s[end]=aux\\n                end-=1\\n            start+=1\\n        res=\"\"\\n        for i in s:\\n            res+=i\\n        return res\\n\\n\\n```",

The intuition is to use two pointers, i and j, to traverse the string from both ends, swapping the vowels as they are encountered.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n1. Create an ArrayList vowList containing all the vowels (both lowercase and uppercase).\\n2. Convert the input string s to a character array arr.\\n3. Initialize two pointers, i at the beginning of the array and j at the end.\\n4. Traverse the array using the two pointers: a. If the character at i is not a vowel, increment i. b. If the character at j is not a vowel, decrement j. c. If both characters at i and j are vowels, swap them and update i and j.\\n5. Continue the traversal until i and j meet or cross each other.\\n6. Convert the modified character array back to a string and return it.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(n), where n is the length of the input string s. The algorithm iterates through the string once, with each character being visited at most twice (once by i and once by j).\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(n) for the character array arr created from the input string s. The space required for the vowList ArrayList is constant, as it only contains a fixed number of vowels\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public String reverseVowels(String s) {\\n        ArrayList<Character> vowList = new ArrayList<Character>();\\n        vowList.add(\\'a\\');\\n        vowList.add(\\'e\\');\\n        vowList.add(\\'i\\');\\n        vowList.add(\\'o\\');\\n        vowList.add(\\'u\\');\\n        vowList.add(\\'A\\');\\n        vowList.add(\\'E\\');\\n        vowList.add(\\'I\\');\\n        vowList.add(\\'O\\');\\n        vowList.add(\\'U\\');\\n        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();\\n        int i=0;\\n        int j=s.length()-1;\\n        while(i<j)\\n        {\\n            if(!vowList.contains(arr[i]))\\n            {\\n                i++;\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n            if(!vowList.contains(arr[j]))\\n            {\\n                j--;\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n        char t = arr[i];\\n        arr[i]=arr[j];\\n        arr[j]=t;\\n        i++;\\n        j--;\\n        }\\n        return new String(arr);\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Then, the input string s is converted to a list of characters using the list() function, since strings are immutable in Python.\\n\\nTwo pointers, left and right, are used to iterate through the list from both ends towards the middle. If both characters at the current positions are vowels, they are swapped. If only the character at left is a vowel, right is decremented. If only the character at right is a vowel, left is incremented. If neither character is a vowel, both pointers are moved towards the middle. This process continues until left >= right.\\n\\nFinally, the modified list is converted back into a string using the \"\".join() method and returned as the output of the function.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n86.71%\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n80.34%\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n  def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:\\n    vowels = set([\\'a\\', \\'e\\', \\'i\\', \\'o\\', \\'u\\', \\'A\\', \\'E\\', \\'I\\', \\'O\\', \\'U\\'])\\n    # Convert string to list since string is immutable in Python\\n    s_list = list(s)\\n    left, right = 0, len(s_list) - 1\\n    while left < right:\\n        if s_list[left] in vowels and s_list[right] in vowels:\\n        # Swap the vowels\\n            s_list[left], s_list[right] = s_list[right], s_list[left]\\n            left += 1\\n            right -= 1\\n        elif s_list[left] in vowels:\\n            right -= 1\\n        elif s_list[right] in vowels:\\n            left += 1\\n        else:\\n            left += 1\\n            right -= 1\\n        # Convert the list back to string and return\\n    return \"\".join(s_list)\\n\\n```",

You may encounter:\\n- A vowel at the left side (at ```s[beg]```) & a consonant at the right (at ```s[end]```)\\n\\t- If so, we keep the ```beg``` pointer as it is, and move the ```end``` pointer a step towards the left.\\n- A consonant at the left side & a vowel at the right\\n\\t- We keep the ```end``` pointer as it is, and move the ```beg``` pointer a step to the right\\n- Vowels at both positions of ```beg``` and ```end```.\\n\\t- We swap the vowels\\n\\nWe carry this out until we\\'re done scanning all the characters.

                "content": "# Approach\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nGiven a string `s`, you need to reverse the order of only the vowels in the string and return the modified string.\\n\\n**Approach:**\\nTo solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. We\\'ll maintain two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the string (`left`) and the other starting from the end of the string (`right`). We\\'ll move these pointers towards each other, swapping the vowels they point to until they meet in the middle.\\n\\n**Logic:**\\n1. Convert the input string `s` into a character array to make it mutable (`char[] arr = s.toCharArray();`).\\n\\n2. Initialize two pointers: `left = 0` (starting from the beginning of the array) and `right = arr.length - 1` (starting from the end of the array).\\n\\n3. Iterate while `left` is less than `right`:\\n   - Check if the character at index `left` is a vowel using the `isVowel` function.\\n     - If it\\'s a vowel, move the `right` pointer towards the left until a vowel is found using the inner `while` loop.\\n     - Swap the vowels at index `left` and index `right` using the `swap` function.\\n     - Move the `right` pointer one step to the left (`right--`).\\n   - Move the `left` pointer one step to the right (`left++`).\\n\\n4. After the loop completes, the character array `arr` will have the vowels reversed in the string.\\n\\n5. Convert the character array `arr` back to a string using `new String(arr)` and return the modified string.\\n\\n**Vowel Check (isVowel function):**\\nThe `isVowel` function checks whether a given character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase) using a simple condition that compares the character against a list of vowel characters.\\n\\n**Swap Function:**\\nThe `swap` function swaps two characters in the character array `arr` using a temporary variable to hold one of the characters while swapping.\\n\\n**Time Complexity:**\\nThe time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The two pointers traverse the string once, and for each character, we either move the `right` pointer leftward or swap two characters, both of which are constant time operations.\\n\\n**Space Complexity:**\\nThe space complexity is O(n) due to the character array `arr` and the constant space used by the `left` and `right` pointers.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public String reverseVowels(String s) {\\n        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();\\n        int left = 0;\\n        int right = arr.length - 1;\\n\\n        while(left < right) {\\n            if(isVowel(arr[left])) {\\n                while(left < right && !isVowel(arr[right])) {\\n                    right--;\\n                }\\n                if(isVowel(arr[right])) {\\n                    swap(arr, left, right);\\n                    right--;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            left++;\\n        }\\n\\n        return new String(arr);\\n    }\\n\\n    private boolean isVowel(char c) {\\n        return c == \\'a\\' || c == \\'e\\' || c == \\'i\\' || c == \\'o\\' || c == \\'u\\' ||\\n            c == \\'A\\' || c == \\'E\\' || c == \\'I\\' || c == \\'O\\' || c == \\'U\\';\\n    }\\n\\n    private void swap(char[] arr, int left, int right) {\\n        char temp = arr[left];\\n        arr[left] = arr[right];\\n        arr[right] = temp;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

We can use one pointer to traverse the string from the beginning and another pointer to traverse the string from the end. Whenever we encounter a vowel at the first pointer and another vowel at the second pointer, we swap them. We continue doing this until the two pointers meet in the middle.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:\\n        vowels = set([\\'a\\', \\'e\\', \\'i\\', \\'o\\', \\'u\\', \\'A\\', \\'E\\', \\'I\\', \\'O\\', \\'U\\'])\\n        s = list(s)\\n        i, j = 0, len(s) - 1\\n        while i < j:\\n            if s[i] in vowels and s[j] in vowels:\\n                s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]\\n                i += 1\\n                j -= 1\\n            elif s[i] in vowels:\\n                j -= 1\\n            else:\\n                i += 1\\n        return \"\".join(s)\\n```\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nIn this code, we first create a set of vowels to check whether a character is a vowel or not. We then convert the string to a list so that we can modify its characters.\\n\\nWe initialize two pointers i and j to point to the first and last characters of the string, respectively. We then move the two pointers towards each other until they meet in the middle.\\n\\nFor each pair of characters, if both are vowels, we swap them. If the character at i is a vowel but the character at j is not, we move j towards the beginning of the string. Similarly, if the character at j is a vowel but the character at i is not, we move i towards the end of the string.\\n\\nFinally, we convert the modified list back to a string and return it.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: The time complexity of this code is $$ O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the string. This is because we only traverse the string once from both ends and perform constant time operations on each character.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: The space complexity of this code is also $$O(n)$$, since we create a list to store the modified string. However, we can modify the string in place, which would reduce the space complexity to $$O(1)$$.\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\nOverall, your code is well-written and easy to understand. It should work correctly for any valid input string.",

Bottoms up, U.S. Motto, boy!\"\\n\\nMy own solution switched the location of the two Y's - which fails to pass the test case.\\n\\nA quick google lead me to find that despite my own schooling, teaching Y as a vowel, it can also be regarded as a consonant.

This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound. However, because of the close relationship with [i], it is classed as a \"semivowel\", also called a \"glide\". The same relationship holds between the glide/semivowel [w] and vowel [u] (English \"ooh\").\n\nBut the letter &lt;y&gt; is also used in English to spell an actual vowel; in fact, this might even be the more frequent use of the letter. Unlike French, though, it spells vowels that can also be spelled with other letters, usually &lt;i&gt;. Examples include \"by\" (which has the PRICE diphthong), \"crypt\" (which has [ɪ] as in KIT), and \"lovely\" (which has the happY vowel, either [ɪ] or [i] depending on what regional variety of English you speak).  For this reason, when I was in school, we learned that the vowels were \"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y\". Which is a confusing conflation of spelling and sound, to my mind.  Some teachers even added \"and sometimes W\", because of &lt;w&gt;'s formation of a diphthong – a vowel's job – in words like \"how\", but unlike &lt;y&gt;, &lt;w&gt; is never a vowel by itself in English.  (Although it's a perfectly cromulent one in Welsh.)\n\nAnyway, you would have to encode a lot of extra knowledge into the program to tease out when a &lt;y&gt; in a string was acting as a vowel. At least the specification now says explicitly that it's just the five vowel letters."

This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound. However, because of the close relationship with [i], it is classed as a \"semivowel\", also called a \"glide\". The same relationship holds between the glide/semivowel [w] and vowel [u] (English \"ooh\").\n\nBut the letter &lt;y&gt; is also used in English to spell an actual vowel; in fact, this might even be the more frequent use of the letter. Unlike French, though, it spells vowels that can also be spelled with other letters, usually &lt;i&gt;. Examples include \"by\" (which has the PRICE diphthong), \"crypt\" (which has [ɪ] as in KIT), and \"lovely\" (which has the happY vowel, either [ɪ] or [i] depending on what regional variety of English you speak).  For this reason, when I was in school, we learned that the vowels were \"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y\". Which is a confusing conflation of spelling and sound, to my mind.  Some teachers even added \"and sometimes W\", because of &lt;w&gt;'s formation of a diphthong – a vowel's job – in words like \"how\", but unlike &lt;y&gt;, &lt;w&gt; is never a vowel by itself in English.  (Although it's a perfectly cromulent one in Welsh.)\n\nAnyway, you would have to encode a lot of extra knowledge into the program to tease out when a &lt;y&gt; in a string was acting as a vowel. At least the specification now says explicitly that it's just the five vowel letters."

This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound. However, because of the close relationship with [i], it is classed as a \"semivowel\", also called a \"glide\". The same relationship holds between the glide/semivowel [w] and vowel [u] (English \"ooh\").\n\nBut the letter &lt;y&gt; is also used in English to spell an actual vowel; in fact, this might even be the more frequent use of the letter. Unlike French, though, it spells vowels that can also be spelled with other letters, usually &lt;i&gt;. Examples include \"by\" (which has the PRICE diphthong), \"crypt\" (which has [ɪ] as in KIT), and \"lovely\" (which has the happY vowel, either [ɪ] or [i] depending on what regional variety of English you speak).  For this reason, when I was in school, we learned that the vowels were \"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y\". Which is a confusing conflation of spelling and sound, to my mind.  Some teachers even added \"and sometimes W\", because of &lt;w&gt;'s formation of a diphthong – a vowel's job – in words like \"how\", but unlike &lt;y&gt;, &lt;w&gt; is never a vowel by itself in English.  (Although it's a perfectly cromulent one in Welsh.)\n\nAnyway, you would have to encode a lot of extra knowledge into the program to tease out when a &lt;y&gt; in a string was acting as a vowel. At least the specification now says explicitly that it's just the five vowel letters."

Bottoms up, U.S. Motto, boy!\"\\n\\nMy own solution switched the location of the two Y's - which fails to pass the test case.\\n\\nA quick google lead me to find that despite my own schooling, teaching Y as a vowel, it can also be regarded as a consonant. Given this somewhat broad ambiguity, I think the question should be updated to either state that Y is considered a consonant, or specify exactly which letters are considered to be vowels.\\n\\nRegards,\\nGazoo"

                        "content": "There are five vowel _letters_ in the Latin alphabet as used for English; however, English has far more than five vowel _sounds_, and doesn't always spell them with one of those five letters.\n\nThe letter Y is not a vowel letter because the primary sound associated with it is a consonant sound: the one at the start of words like \"you\" and \"yuck\". This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound. However, because of the close relationship with [i], it is classed as a \"semivowel\", also called a \"glide\". The same relationship holds between the glide/semivowel [w] and vowel [u] (English \"ooh\").\n\nBut the letter &lt;y&gt; is also used in English to spell an actual vowel; in fact, this might even be the more frequent use of the letter. Unlike French, though, it spells vowels that can also be spelled with other letters, usually &lt;i&gt;. Examples include \"by\" (which has the PRICE diphthong), \"crypt\" (which has [ɪ] as in KIT), and \"lovely\" (which has the happY vowel, either [ɪ] or [i] depending on what regional variety of English you speak).  For this reason, when I was in school, we learned that the vowels were \"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y\". Which is a confusing conflation of spelling and sound, to my mind.  Some teachers even added \"and sometimes W\", because of &lt;w&gt;'s formation of a diphthong – a vowel's job – in words like \"how\", but unlike &lt;y&gt;, &lt;w&gt; is never a vowel by itself in English.  (Although it's a perfectly cromulent one in Welsh.)\n\nAnyway, you would have to encode a lot of extra knowledge into the program to tease out when a &lt;y&gt; in a string was acting as a vowel. At least the specification now says explicitly that it's just the five vowel letters."

This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound. However, because of the close relationship with [i], it is classed as a \"semivowel\", also called a \"glide\". The same relationship holds between the glide/semivowel [w] and vowel [u] (English \"ooh\").\n\nBut the letter &lt;y&gt; is also used in English to spell an actual vowel; in fact, this might even be the more frequent use of the letter. Unlike French, though, it spells vowels that can also be spelled with other letters, usually &lt;i&gt;. Examples include \"by\" (which has the PRICE diphthong), \"crypt\" (which has [ɪ] as in KIT), and \"lovely\" (which has the happY vowel, either [ɪ] or [i] depending on what regional variety of English you speak).  For this reason, when I was in school, we learned that the vowels were \"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y\". Which is a confusing conflation of spelling and sound, to my mind.  Some teachers even added \"and sometimes W\", because of &lt;w&gt;'s formation of a diphthong – a vowel's job – in words like \"how\", but unlike &lt;y&gt;, &lt;w&gt; is never a vowel by itself in English.

Bottoms up, U.S. Motto, boy!\"\\n\\nMy own solution switched the location of the two Y's - which fails to pass the test case.\\n\\nA quick google lead me to find that despite my own schooling, teaching Y as a vowel, it can also be regarded as a consonant. Given this somewhat broad ambiguity, I think the question should be updated to either state that Y is considered a consonant, or specify exactly which letters are considered to be vowels.\\n\\nRegards,\\nGazoo"

                        "content": "There are five vowel _letters_ in the Latin alphabet as used for English; however, English has far more than five vowel _sounds_, and doesn't always spell them with one of those five letters.\n\nThe letter Y is not a vowel letter because the primary sound associated with it is a consonant sound: the one at the start of words like \"you\" and \"yuck\". This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound. However, because of the close relationship with [i], it is classed as a \"semivowel\", also called a \"glide\". The same relationship holds between the glide/semivowel [w] and vowel [u] (English \"ooh\").\n\nBut the letter &lt;y&gt; is also used in English to spell an actual vowel; in fact, this might even be the more frequent use of the letter. Unlike French, though, it spells vowels that can also be spelled with other letters, usually &lt;i&gt;. Examples include \"by\" (which has the PRICE diphthong), \"crypt\" (which has [ɪ] as in KIT), and \"lovely\" (which has the happY vowel, either [ɪ] or [i] depending on what regional variety of English you speak).  For this reason, when I was in school, we learned that the vowels were \"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y\". Which is a confusing conflation of spelling and sound, to my mind.  Some teachers even added \"and sometimes W\", because of &lt;w&gt;'s formation of a diphthong – a vowel's job – in words like \"how\", but unlike &lt;y&gt;, &lt;w&gt; is never a vowel by itself in English.  (Although it's a perfectly cromulent one in Welsh.)\n\nAnyway, you would have to encode a lot of extra knowledge into the program to tease out when a &lt;y&gt; in a string was acting as a vowel. At least the specification now says explicitly that it's just the five vowel letters."

This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound.

Bottoms up, U.S. Motto, boy!\"\\n\\nMy own solution switched the location of the two Y's - which fails to pass the test case.\\n\\nA quick google lead me to find that despite my own schooling, teaching Y as a vowel, it can also be regarded as a consonant.

                        "content": "There are five vowel _letters_ in the Latin alphabet as used for English; however, English has far more than five vowel _sounds_, and doesn't always spell them with one of those five letters.\n\nThe letter Y is not a vowel letter because the primary sound associated with it is a consonant sound: the one at the start of words like \"you\" and \"yuck\". This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound. However, because of the close relationship with [i], it is classed as a \"semivowel\", also called a \"glide\". The same relationship holds between the glide/semivowel [w] and vowel [u] (English \"ooh\").\n\nBut the letter &lt;y&gt; is also used in English to spell an actual vowel; in fact, this might even be the more frequent use of the letter. Unlike French, though, it spells vowels that can also be spelled with other letters, usually &lt;i&gt;. Examples include \"by\" (which has the PRICE diphthong), \"crypt\" (which has [ɪ] as in KIT), and \"lovely\" (which has the happY vowel, either [ɪ] or [i] depending on what regional variety of English you speak).  For this reason, when I was in school, we learned that the vowels were \"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y\". Which is a confusing conflation of spelling and sound, to my mind.  Some teachers even added \"and sometimes W\", because of &lt;w&gt;'s formation of a diphthong – a vowel's job – in words like \"how\", but unlike &lt;y&gt;, &lt;w&gt; is never a vowel by itself in English.  (Although it's a perfectly cromulent one in Welsh.)\n\nAnyway, you would have to encode a lot of extra knowledge into the program to tease out when a &lt;y&gt; in a string was acting as a vowel. At least the specification now says explicitly that it's just the five vowel letters."

Bottoms up, U.S. Motto, boy!\"\\n\\nMy own solution switched the location of the two Y's - which fails to pass the test case.\\n\\nA quick google lead me to find that despite my own schooling, teaching Y as a vowel, it can also be regarded as a consonant.

This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound. However, because of the close relationship with [i], it is classed as a \"semivowel\", also called a \"glide\". The same relationship holds between the glide/semivowel [w] and vowel [u] (English \"ooh\").\n\nBut the letter &lt;y&gt; is also used in English to spell an actual vowel; in fact, this might even be the more frequent use of the letter. Unlike French, though, it spells vowels that can also be spelled with other letters, usually &lt;i&gt;. Examples include \"by\" (which has the PRICE diphthong), \"crypt\" (which has [ɪ] as in KIT), and \"lovely\" (which has the happY vowel, either [ɪ] or [i] depending on what regional variety of English you speak).  For this reason, when I was in school, we learned that the vowels were \"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y\". Which is a confusing conflation of spelling and sound, to my mind.  Some teachers even added \"and sometimes W\", because of &lt;w&gt;'s formation of a diphthong – a vowel's job – in words like \"how\", but unlike &lt;y&gt;, &lt;w&gt; is never a vowel by itself in English.  (Although it's a perfectly cromulent one in Welsh.)\n\nAnyway, you would have to encode a lot of extra knowledge into the program to tease out when a &lt;y&gt; in a string was acting as a vowel. At least the specification now says explicitly that it's just the five vowel letters."

This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound. However, because of the close relationship with [i], it is classed as a \"semivowel\", also called a \"glide\". The same relationship holds between the glide/semivowel [w] and vowel [u] (English \"ooh\").\n\nBut the letter &lt;y&gt; is also used in English to spell an actual vowel; in fact, this might even be the more frequent use of the letter. Unlike French, though, it spells vowels that can also be spelled with other letters, usually &lt;i&gt;. Examples include \"by\" (which has the PRICE diphthong), \"crypt\" (which has [ɪ] as in KIT), and \"lovely\" (which has the happY vowel, either [ɪ] or [i] depending on what regional variety of English you speak).  For this reason, when I was in school, we learned that the vowels were \"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y\". Which is a confusing conflation of spelling and sound, to my mind.  Some teachers even added \"and sometimes W\", because of &lt;w&gt;'s formation of a diphthong – a vowel's job – in words like \"how\", but unlike &lt;y&gt;, &lt;w&gt; is never a vowel by itself in English.  (Although it's a perfectly cromulent one in Welsh.)\n\nAnyway, you would have to encode a lot of extra knowledge into the program to tease out when a &lt;y&gt; in a string was acting as a vowel. At least the specification now says explicitly that it's just the five vowel letters."

This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound. However, because of the close relationship with [i], it is classed as a \"semivowel\", also called a \"glide\". The same relationship holds between the glide/semivowel [w] and vowel [u] (English \"ooh\").\n\nBut the letter &lt;y&gt; is also used in English to spell an actual vowel; in fact, this might even be the more frequent use of the letter. Unlike French, though, it spells vowels that can also be spelled with other letters, usually &lt;i&gt;. Examples include \"by\" (which has the PRICE diphthong), \"crypt\" (which has [ɪ] as in KIT), and \"lovely\" (which has the happY vowel, either [ɪ] or [i] depending on what regional variety of English you speak).  For this reason, when I was in school, we learned that the vowels were \"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y\". Which is a confusing conflation of spelling and sound, to my mind.  Some teachers even added \"and sometimes W\", because of &lt;w&gt;'s formation of a diphthong – a vowel's job – in words like \"how\", but unlike &lt;y&gt;, &lt;w&gt; is never a vowel by itself in English.  (Although it's a perfectly cromulent one in Welsh.)\n\nAnyway, you would have to encode a lot of extra knowledge into the program to tease out when a &lt;y&gt; in a string was acting as a vowel. At least the specification now says explicitly that it's just the five vowel letters."

Bottoms up, U.S. Motto, boy!\"\\n\\nMy own solution switched the location of the two Y's - which fails to pass the test case.\\n\\nA quick google lead me to find that despite my own schooling, teaching Y as a vowel, it can also be regarded as a consonant.

                        "content": "There are five vowel _letters_ in the Latin alphabet as used for English; however, English has far more than five vowel _sounds_, and doesn't always spell them with one of those five letters.\n\nThe letter Y is not a vowel letter because the primary sound associated with it is a consonant sound: the one at the start of words like \"you\" and \"yuck\". This sound, which is spelled [j] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is not a vowel, despite being produced with much the same starting mouth configuration as the vowel [i] (English \"ee\"). The missing criterion is that [j] cannot serve as the nucleus of a syllable by itself; it's a very short sound. However, because of the close relationship with [i], it is classed as a \"semivowel\", also called a \"glide\". The same relationship holds between the glide/semivowel [w] and vowel [u] (English \"ooh\").\n\nBut the letter &lt;y&gt; is also used in English to spell an actual vowel; in fact, this might even be the more frequent use of the letter. Unlike French, though, it spells vowels that can also be spelled with other letters, usually &lt;i&gt;. Examples include \"by\" (which has the PRICE diphthong), \"crypt\" (which has [ɪ] as in KIT), and \"lovely\" (which has the happY vowel, either [ɪ] or [i] depending on what regional variety of English you speak).  For this reason, when I was in school, we learned that the vowels were \"A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y\". Which is a confusing conflation of spelling and sound, to my mind.  Some teachers even added \"and sometimes W\", because of &lt;w&gt;'s formation of a diphthong – a vowel's job – in words like \"how\", but unlike &lt;y&gt;, &lt;w&gt; is never a vowel by itself in English.  (Although it's a perfectly cromulent one in Welsh.)\n\nAnyway, you would have to encode a lot of extra knowledge into the program to tease out when a &lt;y&gt; in a string was acting as a vowel. At least the specification now says explicitly that it's just the five vowel letters."
