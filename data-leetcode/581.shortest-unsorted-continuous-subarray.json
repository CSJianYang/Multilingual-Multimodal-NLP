But, if you don\\'t know don\\'t worry I\\'ll try to teach you.\\n\\nLet\\'s understand first of all what the problem is saying!!\\n```\\nGiven a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\\n```\\nOkay, so from the given statement we will try to find out wether it is a **Sliding Window** problem or not>>\\n\\nSo, to check that out I\\'m giving you a tempelate & it\\'ll work in almost all of the questions of **sliding window**\\n\\n```\\nTo, find out a sliding window problem :-\\n> First thing is, we have given something like an \"Array\" | OR | \"String\"\\n> Second thing is, they are talking about either \"subsequence\" | OR | \"substring\"\\n> And third most thing is, either we have given a \"window size i.e. k\" | OR | we have to \"manually find out window size\" \\n```\\n\\nNow, using above keys let\\'s understand wether this problem is of a sliding window or not.\\n```\\n> Are they talking about, \"Array\" or \"String\" --> yes they are talking about \"string\" +1 point\\n> Are they asking to find out \"subsequence\" or \"substring\" --> yes they are talking about \"substring\" +1 point\\n> Do, we have given a window size --> No, we don\\'t have\\n\\nTotal score is \"2 / 3\" so, it\\'s a 100% sliding window problem. If your score lies from 2/3 to 3/3 that\\'s a gauranteed sliding window problem \\n```\\n\\nNow, let\\'s talk about how we gonna implement sliding window in this problem, but before that I just want to tell you one more thing. There\\'s exist basically 2 types of sliding window.\\n1. Fix size sliding window **{means K is given}**\\n\\n\\n2. Variable silze sliding window **{means K is not given}**\\n\\n**Before moving to the problem I want to give you a template which you can use in any sliding window `{Variable size}` problem**\\n\\n```\\nwhile(j < size()){\\n\\n    // Calculation\\'s happen\\'s here\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n    if(condition < k){\\n        j++;\\n    }\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n    else if(condition == k){\\n        // ans <-- calculation\\n        j++;\\n    }\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\n----------------------------------------------\\n    else if(condition > k){\\n        while(condition > k){\\n            // remove calculation for i\\n            i++;\\n        }\\n        j++;\\n    }\\n----------------------------------------------\\n}\\nreturn ans;\\n```\\n\\nSo, in this problem we gonna deal with variable size sliding window. Let\\'s take one example :-\\n\\n```\\nInput: s = \"abcabcbb\"\\nOutput: 3\\n```\\n\\nSo, inorder to solve this, what I\\'m thinking is, we should have to use one more Data Structure to store the occurence of these characters, I thing HashMap will be best to use.\\n\\n* Now, what I\\'ll do is create 2 pointer\\'s i & j initally they both start from 0\\n* The j pointer will helps us to fill the array while the i pointer will helps in removing from the map {Don\\'t know what I\\'m talking about} just wait. You\\'ll understand :)\\n\\n```\\nLet\\'s understand it visually :-\\n```\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/664cc9c6-1440-4b88-a11f-ca27a67b5266_1654838647.047003.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/088afd9c-bc21-46ca-b651-a46a75c02c4e_1654838698.0517573.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/61717331-f54a-4940-9000-2bf95dc8af56_1654838746.162897.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/3c62fa7f-e7e3-4063-b306-0a3495071004_1654838786.1087303.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/c1aae088-b5e1-4328-aa1f-af414b0ef112_1654838837.5751796.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/fe893a02-e560-4a8f-aaa1-f92e55dd35cd_1654838885.7713046.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/6a268e77-c099-4f01-b0d5-136995310d3f_1654838919.9853337.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/6811ecde-9e2a-47e6-b688-682bb3f0f5a2_1654838956.3712077.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/a751f95a-f42b-4922-9609-c88ad5f339fb_1654838991.3203616.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/f789c5cb-3e73-449e-80de-38f61d5404b9_1654839058.5881085.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/65c28458-d89a-4008-afde-264598e4d127_1654839089.2232268.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/2fb45c3b-a510-4a3b-be1d-02a53fc0ff02_1654839123.2810624.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/5c80c220-70d8-4a9e-9689-a7cd1fb9e11d_1654839162.3931215.png)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b10fc6ab-9f8b-4035-bfbf-5b9e4cca3cb0_1654839175.0759387.png)\\n\\n\\n**Java**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {\\n        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\\n        int i = 0;\\n        int j = 0;\\n        int max = 0;\\n        while(j < s.length()){\\n            map.put(s.charAt(j), map.getOrDefault(s.charAt(j), 0) + 1);\\n            if(map.size() == j - i + 1){\\n                max = Math.max(max, j - i + 1);\\n                j++;\\n            }\\n            else if(map.size() < j - i + 1){\\n                while(map.size() < j - i + 1){\\n                    map.put(s.charAt(i), map.get(s.charAt(i)) - 1);\\n                    if(map.get(s.charAt(i)) == 0) map.remove(s.charAt(i));\\n                    i++;\\n                }\\n                j++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return max;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n**C++**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\\n        if(s.length()==0)return 0;   //if string of length zero comes simply return 0\\n        unordered_map<char,int> m;   //create map to store frequency,(get to know all unique characters\\n        int i=0,j=0,ans=INT_MIN; \\n        while(j<s.length())   \\n        {\\n            m[s[j]]++;  //increase the frequency of the element as you traverse the string\\n            if(m.size()==j-i+1)  // whem map size is equal to the window size means suppose window size is 3 and map size is also three that means in map all unique characters are their\\n            {\\n                ans = max(ans,j-i+1);  //compare the length of the maximum window size\\n            }\\n            else if(m.size()<j-i+1)   //if the map size is less than the window size means there is some duplicate present like window size = 3 and map size = 2 means there is a duplicates\\n            {\\n                while(m.size()<j-i+1)  //so till the duplicates are removed completely\\n                {\\n                    m[s[i]]--;   //remove the duplicates\\n                    if(m[s[i]]==0)  //if the frequency becomes zero \\n                    {\\n                        m.erase(s[i]);//delete it completely\\n                    }\\n                    i++;  //go for next element \\n                }\\n            }\\n             j++;  //go for the next element\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

We use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the boundaries of the current substring. As we iterate through the string, we update the pointers and adjust the window to accommodate new unique characters and eliminate repeating characters.\\n\\n# Approach 1 - Set\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n1. We use a set (`charSet`) to keep track of unique characters in the current substring.\\n2. We maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the boundaries of the current substring.\\n3. The `maxLength` variable keeps track of the length of the longest substring encountered so far.\\n4. We iterate through the string using the `right` pointer.\\n5. If the current character is not in the set (`charSet`), it means we have a new unique character.\\n6. We insert the character into the set and update the `maxLength` if necessary.\\n7. If the character is already present in the set, it indicates a repeating character within the current substring.\\n8. In this case, we move the `left` pointer forward, removing characters from the set until the repeating character is no longer present.\\n9. We insert the current character into the set and continue the iteration.\\n10. Finally, we return the `maxLength` as the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\\n\\n# Code\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        int maxLength = 0;\\n        unordered_set<char> charSet;\\n        int left = 0;\\n        \\n        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {\\n            if (charSet.count(s[right]) == 0) {\\n                charSet.insert(s[right]);\\n                maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);\\n            } else {\\n                while (charSet.count(s[right])) {\\n                    charSet.erase(s[left]);\\n                    left++;\\n                }\\n                charSet.insert(s[right]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return maxLength;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        int maxLength = 0;\\n        Set<Character> charSet = new HashSet<>();\\n        int left = 0;\\n        \\n        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {\\n            if (!charSet.contains(s.charAt(right))) {\\n                charSet.add(s.charAt(right));\\n                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);\\n            } else {\\n                while (charSet.contains(s.charAt(right))) {\\n                    charSet.remove(s.charAt(left));\\n                    left++;\\n                }\\n                charSet.add(s.charAt(right));\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return maxLength;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n```Python3 []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:\\n        n = len(s)\\n        maxLength = 0\\n        charSet = set()\\n        left = 0\\n        \\n        for right in range(n):\\n            if s[right] not in charSet:\\n                charSet.add(s[right])\\n                maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1)\\n            else:\\n                while s[right] in charSet:\\n                    charSet.remove(s[left])\\n                    left += 1\\n                charSet.add(s[right])\\n        \\n        return maxLength\\n\\n```\\n\\n# Approach 2 - Unordered Map\\n1. We improve upon the first solution by using an unordered map (`charMap`) instead of a set.\\n2. The map stores characters as keys and their indices as values.\\n3. We still maintain the `left` and `right` pointers and the `maxLength` variable.\\n4. We iterate through the string using the `right` pointer.\\n5. If the current character is not in the map or its index is less than `left`, it means it is a new unique character.\\n6 We update the `charMap` with the character\\'s index and update the `maxLength` if necessary.\\n7. If the character is repeating within the current substring, we move the `left` pointer to the next position after the last occurrence of the character.\\n8. We update the index of the current character in the `charMap` and continue the iteration.\\n9. At the end, we return the `maxLength` as the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\\n\\n# Code\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        int maxLength = 0;\\n        unordered_map<char, int> charMap;\\n        int left = 0;\\n        \\n        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {\\n            if (charMap.count(s[right]) == 0 || charMap[s[right]] < left) {\\n                charMap[s[right]] = right;\\n                maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);\\n            } else {\\n                left = charMap[s[right]] + 1;\\n                charMap[s[right]] = right;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return maxLength;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        int maxLength = 0;\\n        Map<Character, Integer> charMap = new HashMap<>();\\n        int left = 0;\\n        \\n        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {\\n            if (!charMap.containsKey(s.charAt(right)) || charMap.get(s.charAt(right)) < left) {\\n                charMap.put(s.charAt(right), right);\\n                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);\\n            } else {\\n                left = charMap.get(s.charAt(right)) + 1;\\n                charMap.put(s.charAt(right), right);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return maxLength;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n```Python3 []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:\\n        n = len(s)\\n        maxLength = 0\\n        charMap = {}\\n        left = 0\\n        \\n        for right in range(n):\\n            if s[right] not in charMap or charMap[s[right]] < left:\\n                charMap[s[right]] = right\\n                maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1)\\n            else:\\n                left = charMap[s[right]] + 1\\n                charMap[s[right]] = right\\n        \\n        return maxLength\\n\\n```\\n\\n# Approach 3 - Integer Array\\n1. This solution uses an integer array `charIndex` to store the indices of characters.\\n2. We eliminate the need for an unordered map by utilizing the array.\\n3. The `maxLength`, `left`, and `right` pointers are still present.\\n4. We iterate through the string using the `right` pointer.\\n5. We check if the current character has occurred within the current substring by comparing its index in `charIndex` with `left`.\\n6. If the character has occurred, we move the `left` pointer to the next position after the last occurrence of the character.\\n7. We update the index of the current character in `charIndex`.\\n8. At each step, we update the `maxLength` by calculating the length of the current substring.\\n9. We continue the iteration until reaching the end of the string.\\n10. Finally, we return the `maxLength` as the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\\n\\n# Code\\n```C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        int maxLength = 0;\\n        vector<int> charIndex(128, -1);\\n        int left = 0;\\n        \\n        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {\\n            if (charIndex[s[right]] >= left) {\\n                left = charIndex[s[right]] + 1;\\n            }\\n            charIndex[s[right]] = right;\\n            maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);\\n        }\\n        \\n        return maxLength;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n```Java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        int maxLength = 0;\\n        int[] charIndex = new int[128];\\n        Arrays.fill(charIndex, -1);\\n        int left = 0;\\n        \\n        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {\\n            if (charIndex[s.charAt(right)] >= left) {\\n                left = charIndex[s.charAt(right)] + 1;\\n            }\\n            charIndex[s.charAt(right)] = right;\\n            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);\\n        }\\n        \\n        return maxLength;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n```Python3 []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:\\n        n = len(s)\\n        maxLength = 0\\n        charIndex = [-1] * 128\\n        left = 0\\n        \\n        for right in range(n):\\n            if charIndex[ord(s[right])] >= left:\\n                left = charIndex[ord(s[right])] + 1\\n            charIndex[ord(s[right])] = right\\n            maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1)\\n        \\n        return maxLength\\n\\n```\\n\\n![CUTE_CAT.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/3831fd95-3bb1-44d1-bc1a-06b3b4317b56_1687028369.5286949.png)\\n**If you found my solution helpful, I would greatly appreciate your upvote, as it would motivate me to continue sharing more solutions.**\\n\\n\\n",

Let\\'s do two checks on 0 and 1 so as not to waste extra time. Now we can start, in the picture above you can see our **window** (blue rectangle) and its movement during the scan. We gradually add our letters to the **hash table**, and if it already contains this letter, we delete the letter corresponding to the leftmost index, do this until we get to the desired one and delete the repetition. Only after that we add our new element. \\nThe maximum length is found by comparing our current length with the new one, using **Math.max**.\\n\\nIn the picture you can see all the movement of the window and the state of our hash table.\\n\\n\\n```\\nvar lengthOfLongestSubstring = function (s) {\\n    let set = new Set();\\n    let left = 0;\\n    let maxSize = 0;\\n\\n    if (s.length === 0) return 0;\\n    if (s.length === 1) return 1;\\n\\n    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {\\n\\n        while (set.has(s[i])) {\\n            set.delete(s[left])\\n            left++;\\n        }\\n        set.add(s[i]);\\n        maxSize = Math.max(maxSize, i - left + 1)\\n    }\\n    return maxSize;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI hope I was able to explain clearly.\\n**Happy coding**! \\uD83D\\uDE43\\n",

Using two pointers and a sliding window, we can quite easily choose what substring we want to look at. In fact, finding the longest substring without repeating characters becomes even easier once you realise the following observation.\\n\\n**Key Observation:**\\n> Once we\\'ve landed on a character we\\'ve seen before, we want to move the left pointer of our window to the index *after* the last occurrence of that character.\\n\\nPay attention to the following example with the input string `s = \"babcadba\"` to see this in action:\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/394b1faa-f48c-486a-b672-8ccd6f758e2e_1666482154.3857741.png)\\n\\nAs you can see, our `nextIndex[]` array functions as both a hashset and a way to keep track of indexes. In particular, our array is storing the index AFTER the last occurrence of any character. That way, our left pointer can move directly there. \\n___\\n### How does this work in code?\\nTurns out characters can function as integers. As such, we can use the characters themselves to access values of our `nextIndex[]` array. We\\'ll need an array that has range: [0, 128) as that covers all ASCII characters that could be used in this question. \\n\\nSince we\\'re working with two pointers, we can quite conveniently find the length of our current window using `r - l + 1`. We can update this anytime it\\'s larger than our current maximum.\\n\\nAwesome. Now we\\'re ready to start coding!\\n\\n___\\n### Code\\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or improvements, feel free to let me know.

                "content": "Dear All,\\n\\nI solved this issue with different approaches and happy to share with you. Probably looking to all of them and comparing you will understand which one is better and why. All solutions containes comments for your better understanding of algorithm. Hope you will enjoy =)\\n\\nPlease find below my last and best solution with Sliding Window approach. Here we have O(n) time complexity(where n is a length of string) and O(k) space complexity(where k is unique characters from the string). You can notice that find() takes additional affort and Time Complexity won\\'t be equal to O(n). I will try to explain: In general Time Complexity of searching elements in map is O(log n) in worst case. But exactly in our case it\\'s very close to O(1) because we add only unique characters and range of possible characters is very small compared to string length. Let\\'s imagine that our string contains 1 000 000 characters. But in Hash Table will be maximum 128 characters(in real life even less because some specific characters won\\'t not used). Method find() in our case will be O(log 128) = 7 - very close to constant time. So, on each step logic will do maximum 7 additional steps. That\\'s why it\\'s very close to O(n). We can say that TC is O(n * log m), where n - length of string, m - number of unique characters from string. But since we know that m not more than 128, and log m not more than 7 - is very close to constant and we can ignore it.\\nWe can try to use unordered_map that TC of find is O(1). The reason why I use map instead - unordered_map is not stable. In worst case TC will be O(n), not O(1). It happens when hash function will generate same hash index that calls collisions. Also unordered_map required for extra space for Hash Table. map - always O(log n). Since we know that log n = 7 in worse case - make sense use map.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) \\n    {        \\n        // Return 0 if string is empty\\n        if( s == \"\") { return 0; }\\n        \\n        // Hash table for storing characters and indexes\\n        map<char, int> characters;       \\n        \\n        // Longest sequence that will be returned in the end: for sure will be > 1 because 0 result was checked in the beginning\\n        int longest = 1;\\n        int j = 0;\\n        \\n        // Each character from string add to HashTable with his index. If we reach same character again - update index\\n        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i)\\n        {\\n            // If current character already exist in the HashTable  \\n            if ( characters.find(s[i]) != characters.end() )\\n            {\\n                // Take larger index for future calculation between old and current+1 in HashTable\\n                j = j >= characters.find(s[i])->second + 1 ? j : characters.find(s[i])->second + 1;\\n            }\\n            // Add character with current index to HashTable\\n            characters[s[i]] = i;\\n            // longest will be chosen between larger value: old longest OR current sequance between i and j indexes + 1\\n            longest = longest >= i - j + 1 ? longest : i - j + 1;\\n        }\\n        \\n        return longest;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nNext will be my first try with brute force solution that has O(n^3) complexity. This approach will work here in LeetCode for small strings, but for big you will receive status \\'Time Limit Exceeded\\'. In your IDE it will work even for big strings but very slowly. Iterator used just for practice. New method was created in private section for checking dublicates in substring - `bool dublicatesInSubstring(string& s, const int substringBegin, const int substringEnd)`.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\nprivate:\\n    // Method for dublicates check in substring\\n    bool dublicatesInSubstring(string& s, const int substringBegin, const int substringEnd)\\n    {\\n        std::map<char, int> charactersOfSubstr;\\n        std::map<char, int>::iterator it;\\n        \\n        // Check substring for dublicates\\n        for(int i = substringBegin; i <= substringEnd; ++i )\\n        {\\n            // Add character to HashTable\\n            it = charactersOfSubstr.find(s[i]);\\n            if ( it != charactersOfSubstr.end() )\\n            {\\n                it->second++;\\n            }\\n            else\\n            {\\n                charactersOfSubstr.insert(std::pair<char,int>(s[i], 0));\\n            }\\n            // In case HashTable has more that one such character - return true that means dublicates exist in substring\\n            if( it->second > 0 )\\n            {\\n                return true;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return false;\\n    }\\n    \\npublic:\\n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) \\n    {\\n        // Return 0 if string is empty\\n        if( s == \"\") { return 0; }\\n        \\n        // Longest sequence that will be returned in the end\\n        int longest = 0;\\n        \\n        // For each character from string - ckech longest sequence untin end of the string\\n        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i)\\n        {\\n            for(int j = i; j < s.length(); ++j)\\n            {\\n                // In case no dublicates - function return false and longest substring should be calculated\\n                if ( !dublicatesInSubstring(s, i, j) )\\n                {\\n                    longest = longest >= j - i + 1 ? longest : j - i + 1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return longest;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nMy next try was approach with O(n^2) complexity that much faster than previous and LeetCode finished all test cases without \\'Time Limit Exceeded\\' status.

After this approach I thought that it\\'s possible to get rid of nested loop.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) \\n    {        \\n        // Return 0 if string is empty\\n        if( s == \"\") { return 0; }\\n        \\n        // Hash table for storing characters and count dublicates\\n        std::map<char, int> charactersOfSubstr;       \\n        \\n        // Longest sequence that will be returned in the end\\n        int longest = 0;\\n        int j = 0;\\n        \\n        // Each character from string add to HashTable: for dublicates increase value that used in result calculation\\n        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i)\\n        {\\n            // Try to find character in the HashTable\\n            // If current character already exist in the HashTable - increment value\\n            if ( charactersOfSubstr.find(s[i]) != charactersOfSubstr.end() )\\n            {\\n                charactersOfSubstr.find(s[i])->second++;\\n            }\\n            // Othervise add it to HashTable\\n            else\\n            {\\n                charactersOfSubstr.insert(pair<char, int>(s[i], 1));\\n            }\\n            \\n            // ONLY if in HashTable exist several same characters:\\n            // decrease ALL characters between j and i in HashTable AND increase j for calculation while s[i] value in Hash table > 1\\n            while ( charactersOfSubstr.find(s[i])->second > 1 )\\n            {\\n                // Descrease value of existing character\\n                charactersOfSubstr.find(s[j])->second--;\\n                // Increase j for future calculation\\n                ++j;\\n            }\\n            \\n            // longest will be chosen between larger value: old longest OR current sequance (i - j + 1)\\n            longest = longest >= i - j + 1 ? longest : i - j + 1;\\n        }\\n        \\n        return longest;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nHope you read until the end and enjoyed =)\\nIf you know how to improve the code - please let me know I will be very grateful.\\nIf you like solution please vote - I will be pleased.\\n\\nThanks and have a good day.\\n\\nBest Regards, Yevhen.\\n",

For example `[0, 0)` is empty window, and `[2, 4)` is window with `2` elements: `2` and `3`.\\nLet us discuss our algorithm now:\\n1. `window` is set of symbols in our window, we use set to check in `O(1)` if new symbol inside it or not.\\n2. `beg = end = 0` in the beginning, so we start with empty window, also `ans = 0` and `n = len(s)`.\\n3. Now, we continue, until one of two of our pointers reaches the end. First, we try to extend our window to the right: check `s[end] in window` and if we can, add it to set, move `end` pointer to the right and update `ans`. If we can not add new symbol to set, it means it is already in `window` set, and we need to move left pointer and move `beg` pointer to the right.\\n\\n**Complexity**: we move both of our pointers only to the left, so time complexity is `O(n)`. Space complexity is `O(1)`.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):\\n        window = set()\\n        beg, end, ans, n = 0, 0, 0, len(s)\\n        \\n        while beg < n and end < n:\\n            if s[end] not in window:\\n                if end + 1 < n: window.add(s[end])\\n                end += 1\\n                ans = max(ans, end - beg)\\n            else:\\n                window.remove(s[beg])\\n                beg += 1\\n                \\n        return ans\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

We can use a sliding window technique to keep track of the longest substring without repeating characters. \\n\\n# Approach:\\n1. Initialize ans=0, l=0, r=0.\\n2. Create a map of size 256 to store the last occurrence of each character in the string, initialized with -1.\\n3. Traverse the string from left to right, with the right end of the window (r) expanding as long as there are no repeating characters.\\n4. When a repeating character is found at index r, we update the left end of the window (l) to the next index of the repeated character. \\n5. Update the map with the current index of the repeated character.\\n6. Update ans with the maximum length of the current substring and the previous maximum.\\n7. Return ans.\\n\\n# Complexity:\\n- Time complexity: The algorithm traverses the given string only once. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.\\n- Space complexity: The space required to store the map is O(256), which is constant.

Finally, we return `res`.\\n\\nTime complexity: `O(n)`, space complexity: `O(n)`.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type s: str\\n        :rtype: int\\n        \"\"\"\\n        dic = {}\\n        res = 0\\n        j = 0\\n        for i in range(len(s)):\\n            if s[i] not in dic:\\n                dic[s[i]] = i\\n            else:\\n                j = max(j, dic[s[i]]+1)\\n                dic[s[i]] = i\\n            res = max(res, i-j+1)\\n        return res\\n```",

                "content": "## Explanation\\n\\nThe main method used for this problem is the **sliding window** technique. The sliding window is essentially 2 pointers that will help to keep track the start and end of a substring. In this solution, this window will always contain a substring with no duplicate characters.\\n\\nHere are the brief steps of my solution:\\n\\n1. We initialize the variables maxLength, which keeps track of the current longest length of any substring in the string, and left, which is the start of the substring currently being tracked. A set is also initialised to keep track of the elements in a substring. Since there are no duplicate characters in the substring (unique), a set will be a perfect tool to keep track of duplicates.\\n\\n2. We iterate through this loop using a right pointer. As this right pointer moves, we first check if the char at the right pointer is a duplicate of any previous characters in the substring by cross checking with the set.\\n\\n3. If the set already has the character, the set will continuously remove the leftmost char s[left] while also shifting the left pointer to the right. This will shrink the window size until there are no more duplicates characters.\\n\\n4. Once it is ensured that there are no duplicate characters, it will add the right most char s[right] to the set and update maxLength if this new substring is longer than a previous substring.\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\nThe time complexity of this solution is linear, **O(n)**, since we solved the problem by having to pass through the string only once.\\n\\nHere are the details of my submission:\\nRuntime: 96 ms, faster than 89.62% \\nMemory Usage: 43.3 MB, less than 74.80% \\n\\n## Code\\n\\n```\\nvar lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {\\n    var maxLength = 0\\n    var left = 0\\n    var charSet = new Set()\\n    \\n    for (var right = 0; right < s.length; right++){\\n        while (charSet.has(s[right])){\\n            charSet.delete(s[left])\\n            left += 1\\n        }\\n        charSet.add(s[right])\\n        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1)\\n    }\\n    \\n    return maxLength\\n};\\n```\\n\\nI hope this helps!

                "content": "# Intuition\\nUpon encountering this problem, my initial instinct is to utilize the sliding window technique to identify the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\\n\\n# Approach\\nMy approach to tackling this problem involves implementing the sliding window technique to ascertain the length of the longest substring that does not contain any repeated characters. To do so, I maintain a HashSet called `uniqueChars` to keep track of the characters present in the current window. Additionally, two pointers named `start` and `end` denote the beginning and end of the present substring segment. Furthermore, a variable named `maxSubstringLength` is utilized to track the length of the longest valid substring.\\n\\nThe algorithm operates as follows:\\n1. While the `end` pointer remains within the bounds of the string:\\n   - If the character at the `end` position is not present in the `uniqueChars` set:\\n     - Add the character to the set.\\n     - Update the `maxSubstringLength` by comparing it to the length of the current substring (`end - start + 1`).\\n     - Increment the `end` pointer.\\n   - If the character at the `end` position is already in the `uniqueChars` set:\\n     - Remove the character at the `start` position from the set.\\n     - Increment the `start` pointer to slide the window to the right.\\n\\nUpon completing the iteration, the algorithm returns the calculated `maxSubstringLength`.\\n\\nThis sliding window approach efficiently identifies the length of the longest substring without repeating characters, accomplishing the task in a single traversal of the string.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n)\\n  The algorithm traverses the provided string once, performing constant-time operations at each step.\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(k)\\n  The algorithm employs a HashSet named `uniqueChars` to store distinct characters in the current window. In the worst case, the HashSet may contain all characters from the input string, leading to a space complexity of O(k), where k is the size of the character set.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n     public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {\\nHashSet<Character> uniqueChars = new HashSet<>();\\n    int start = 0;\\n    int end = 0;\\n    int maxSubstringLength = 0;\\n\\n    while (end < s.length()) {\\n        if (!uniqueChars.contains(s.charAt(end))) {\\n            uniqueChars.add(s.charAt(end));\\n            maxSubstringLength = Math.max(maxSubstringLength, end - start + 1);\\n            end++;\\n        } else {\\n            uniqueChars.remove(s.charAt(start));\\n            start++;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    return maxSubstringLength;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n![c0504eaf-5fb8-4a1d-a769-833262d1b86e_1674433591.3836212.webp](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/8a3b41d1-f0ca-472f-a9f7-8346b34a824e_1693297402.2918687.webp)",

                "content": "https://youtu.be/pY2dYa1m2VM\\n\\nA brute force solution would first require finding every possible substring, which would run in O(n<sup>2</sup>) time.  We\\'re not done yet though, because we now have to check every substring for duplicate characters by iterating through every substring.  Each check for duplicate characters runs in O(n) time, and we need to do that for every substring generated (which ran in O(n<sup>2</sup>) time), so the brute force approach ends up running in O(n<sup>3</sup>) time.\\n\\nInstead, we can reduce this to O(n) time by using a sliding window approach and eliminating unnecessary computations.  We use two pointers, `l` and `r`, to denote where the substring starts and ends, and a dictionary called `seen` to keep track of the index of each character encountered.  Then, we move the right pointer one character at a time to the right to expand our substring.\\n\\nAt each iteration, we check for two things.\\n1. Have we seen the newly added character (at index `r`) before?  If we haven\\'t, then this is a brand new character and we can just add it to the substring and extend the length\\n2. If we have seen it before, is its last known position greater than or equal to the left index?  If it is, then that means it\\'s repeated somewhere in the substring.  If not, then that means it\\'s <i>outside</i> of the substring, so we can just add it to the substring and extend the length\\n\\nSo if both conditions are true, the new character is repeated and we have a problem.  We can get rid of the repeated character by moving up the left pointer to be one index past the last recorded index in `seen`. Then, we just keep moving up the right pointer until it reaches the end of the string.  Since we only have to loop through the string once, and since hash table lookups run in constant time, this algorithm ends up running in O(n) time.\\n\\nFor an intuitive proof of why this works and why we don\\'t need to check all the other substrings while moving up the left pointer, please see the video - it\\'s a bit difficult to explain without a visualization and a concrete example.  But basically, all the other substrings will either still contain a repeated character or will be shorter than the last valid substring encountered, so they can be safely ignored.\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):\\n        seen = {}\\n        l = 0\\n        length = 0\\n        for r in range(len(s)):\\n            char = s[r]\\n            if char in seen and seen[char] >= l:\\n                l = seen[char] + 1\\n            else:\\n                length = max(length, r - l + 1)\\n            seen[char] = r\\n\\n        return length\\n```",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nTo find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string \"s\", you can use the \"Sliding Window\" technique. Here\\'s the general idea:\\n\\nCreate two pointers, \"start\" and \"end\", initially set to 0.\\nUse a hash set to store the characters in the current substring.\\nWhile \"end\" is less than the length of the string:\\na. If the character at \"end\" is not in the hash set, add it and move the \"end\" pointer to the right.\\nb. If the character at \"end\" is already in the hash set, remove the character at \"start\" from the hash set and move the \"start\" pointer to the right.\\nThe length of the longest substring is the maximum distance between the \"start\" and \"end\" pointers.\\n# Approach\\nWhile \"end\" is less than the length of the string:\\na. If the character at \"end\" is not in the hash set, add it to the hash set and move the \"end\" pointer to the right.\\nb. If the character at \"end\" is already in the hash set, remove the character at \"start\" from the hash set and move the \"start\" pointer to the right.\\nThis way, the \"start\" and \"end\" pointers are moved towards each other until a repeating character is found, at which point the \"start\" pointer is moved to the right to exclude the repeating character. The process continues until the \"end\" pointer reaches the end of the string.\\n\\nThe length of the longest substring without repeating characters is equal to the maximum distance between the \"start\" and \"end\" pointers.

Thank you!\\u2764\\uFE0F**\\n> \\n---\\n\\n## Explanation:\\n\\n### Solution 01\\n\\n- Solution using ***HashMap.***\\n- First, we took a map *mp* and initialize all characters with -1.`for(auto x:s) mp[x] = -1;`\\n- Then we took start to keep track the last position of a character, initialize with -1.\\n- if a character in map has a value greater than start that means it is already present in some previous index, so update start with the previous index value.\\n`if(mp[s[i]] > start) start = mp[s[i]];`\\n- We\\u2019ll update the character value in the map with the present index & calculate the maximum length by taking the maximum of ans and i-start, which indicates the last index to the current index where no character is repeating. `ans = max(ans, i-start)`\\n- **Time complexity:** O(n).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Code:\\n\\n```cpp\\n//Solution 01:\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\\n        int n = s.size();\\n        unordered_map<char, int> mp;\\n        for(auto x:s)\\n            mp[x] = -1;\\n        \\n        int i=0, start=-1, ans=0;\\n        while(i<n){\\n            if(mp[s[i]] > start)\\n                start = mp[s[i]];\\n            mp[s[i]] = i;\\n            ans = max(ans, i-start);\\n            i++;\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n> **Please upvote this solution**\\n>",

We will:\\n* to store the value of the current character in `c`;\\n* compute `bit` left-shifting `base` by a value always in the `0 - 63` range;\\n* check with our bitmasks if we already found that character and, in case, since it means we just finished a viable subsequence:\\n\\t* update `res` as the maximum between its current value and `tmp`;\\n\\t* reset `tmp`, `mask1` and `mask2` all to `0`;\\n\\t* backtrack. and reset `i` to be on the first previous occurrence of `c`;\\n* if instead it is the first time we are encountering it, we will:\\n\\t* increase `tmp` by `1`;\\n\\t* update either `mask1` or `mask2` with `bit`.\\n\\nOnce we are done, we will again compute the maximum between `res` and `tmp`, so to capture also sequences that included the very last character, and return it :)\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\\n        int res = 0, tmp = 0;\\n        long long mask1 = 0, mask2 = 0, bit, base = 1 ;\\n        for (int i = 0, lmt = s.size(), c; i < lmt; i++) {\\n            // updating c and bit\\n            c = s[i];\\n            bit = base << (c < 64 ? c : c - 64);\\n            // character already used\\n            if ((c < 64 ? mask1 : mask2) & bit) {\\n                res = max(res, tmp);\\n                tmp = mask1 = mask2 = 0;\\n                // backtracking i\\n                while (s[--i] != c);\\n            }\\n            // character not used before\\n            else {\\n                tmp++;\\n                (c < 64 ? mask1 : mask2) |= bit;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return max(res, tmp);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nNow, you might notice that with that backtracking logic we are going to potentially recompute a lot of the already parsed string and it is here that a 2 pointers approach shines.\\n\\nMost of the code is the same, but we will never completely reset `mask1` and `mask2`, instead we will just use 2 pointers `i` and `j` to delimit our substring, normally advancing with `j` until we find an already seen character, in which case we advance `i` right after the previous occurrence of the same character, erasing the matching bits in our bitmasks, but without redoing the same work twice: it is about 7-8 time faster, with basically the same memory consumption:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\\n        int res = 0, tmp = 0;\\n        long long mask1 = 0, mask2 = 0, bit, base = 1 ;\\n        for (int i = 0, j = 0, lmt = s.size(), c; j < lmt; j++) {\\n            // updating c and bit\\n            c = s[j];\\n            bit = base << (c < 64 ? c : c - 64);\\n            // character already used\\n            if ((c < 64 ? mask1 : mask2) & bit) {\\n                res = max(res, tmp);\\n                // advancing i\\n                while (s[i] != c) {\\n                    (c < 64 ? mask1 : mask2) ^= base << (s[i] < 64 ? s[i] : s[i] - 64);\\n                    i++;\\n                };\\n                i++;\\n                tmp = j - i + 1;\\n            }\\n            // character not used before\\n            else {\\n                tmp++;\\n                (c < 64 ? mask1 : mask2) |= bit;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return max(res, tmp);\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "**Solution 1**(Original): using a set to maintain a window (bounded by *l* and *r*) only contains distinct chars. When there is a new character, adds to set, and move *r* forward; when it's a character that already exists, move *l* forward right next to the previous inserted character as *s[r]*. This is my original solution, but may have some overheads when erasing elements from set. Just a different perspective.\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n    class Solution {\\n        public:\\n            int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\\n                if(s.size()<1) return s.size();\\n                int l=0, r=0, len=1;\\n                unordered_set<char> window;\\n                while(r<s.size()){\\n                    if(window.find(s[r])==window.end()){\\n                        window.insert(s[r++]);\\n                        len=max(len, r-l);\\n                    }else{\\n                        while(s[l]!=s[r]) window.erase(s[l++]);\\n                        l++;\\n                        r++;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                return len;\\n            }\\n        };\\n\\n\\n**Solution 2**: thanks to this [post][1] by cbmbbz which is the most voted. The basic idea is, keep a hashmap which stores the characters in string as keys and their positions as values, and keep two pointers which define the potential max substring(*window* using my word). move the right pointer to scan through the string , and meanwhile update the hashmap. If the character is already in the hashmap, then move the left pointer to the right of the same character last found. Note that the two pointers can only move forward.\\n\\nTo understand *l=max(l,window[s[r]]+1)* is the key here:\\n\\nIf position of last found char same as s[*r*] is beyond *l*, which means the window will have two same chars s[*r*] now, so we need to move forward *l* to shrink the window. Otherwise, l stays the same. That's all what\\t says. Your feedback or any thought is welcome. I really learnt a lot from all you genius.\\n\\n***Example 1***  \"tmmzuxt\"\\n\\ns[*l*] is the 2nd \"m\", s[*r*] is the last \"t\", and the last found t is not in the current window, no need to update *l*.\\n\\n***Example 2*** \"mmzuxtabt\"\\n\\ns[*l*] is the 2nd m, s[*r*] is the last \"t\", and the last found \"t\" is in the current window, so move *l* forward to \"a\".\\n\\n\\n    class Solution {\\n    public:\\n        int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\\n            int l=0, r=0, len=0;\\n            unordered_map<char, int> window;\\n            while(r<s.size()){\\n                if(window.find(s[r])!=window.end())\\n                    l=max(l,window[s[r]]+1);      //see explain      \\n                window[s[r]]=r;\\n                len=max(len,r-l+1);\\n                r++;\\n            }\\n            return len;\\n        }\\n    };\\n\\n  [1]: https://leetcode.com/discuss/23883/11-line-simple-java-solution-o-n-with-explanation",

It will solve all the test cases except 985 - 987.\n\nhere is my code which implements your approach:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    bool isCharacterInString(const string& str, char ch) {\n        for (char c : str) {\n            if (c == ch) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int maxi = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int var = min(26, n - i);\n            for (int j = 0; j < var; j++) {\n                string str = s.substr(i, j + 1);\n                string temp = \"\";\n                bool good = true;\n                for (int k = 0; k < str.size(); k++) {\n                    if (isCharacterInString(temp, str[k])) {\n                        good = false;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        temp += str[k];\n                    }\n                }\n                if (good) {\n                    maxi = max(maxi, (int)str.size());\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return maxi;\n    }\n};\n```\nagain, note that this does not work for this problem. nice thinking though!\n\nthe way i did it is by using hash sets, which gives you 2 for loops with at worst O(n^2) time (which won't happen). It involves using ```for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {for int j = i; j < n; j++}```. "

It will solve all the test cases except 985 - 987.\n\nhere is my code which implements your approach:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    bool isCharacterInString(const string& str, char ch) {\n        for (char c : str) {\n            if (c == ch) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int maxi = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int var = min(26, n - i);\n            for (int j = 0; j < var; j++) {\n                string str = s.substr(i, j + 1);\n                string temp = \"\";\n                bool good = true;\n                for (int k = 0; k < str.size(); k++) {\n                    if (isCharacterInString(temp, str[k])) {\n                        good = false;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        temp += str[k];\n                    }\n                }\n                if (good) {\n                    maxi = max(maxi, (int)str.size());\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return maxi;\n    }\n};\n```\nagain, note that this does not work for this problem. nice thinking though!\n\nthe way i did it is by using hash sets, which gives you 2 for loops with at worst O(n^2) time (which won't happen). It involves using ```for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {for int j = i; j < n; j++}```. "

It will solve all the test cases except 985 - 987.\n\nhere is my code which implements your approach:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    bool isCharacterInString(const string& str, char ch) {\n        for (char c : str) {\n            if (c == ch) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int maxi = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int var = min(26, n - i);\n            for (int j = 0; j < var; j++) {\n                string str = s.substr(i, j + 1);\n                string temp = \"\";\n                bool good = true;\n                for (int k = 0; k < str.size(); k++) {\n                    if (isCharacterInString(temp, str[k])) {\n                        good = false;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        temp += str[k];\n                    }\n                }\n                if (good) {\n                    maxi = max(maxi, (int)str.size());\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return maxi;\n    }\n};\n```\nagain, note that this does not work for this problem. nice thinking though!\n\nthe way i did it is by using hash sets, which gives you 2 for loops with at worst O(n^2) time (which won't happen). It involves using ```for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {for int j = i; j < n; j++}```. "

It will solve all the test cases except 985 - 987.\n\nhere is my code which implements your approach:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    bool isCharacterInString(const string& str, char ch) {\n        for (char c : str) {\n            if (c == ch) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int maxi = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int var = min(26, n - i);\n            for (int j = 0; j < var; j++) {\n                string str = s.substr(i, j + 1);\n                string temp = \"\";\n                bool good = true;\n                for (int k = 0; k < str.size(); k++) {\n                    if (isCharacterInString(temp, str[k])) {\n                        good = false;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        temp += str[k];\n                    }\n                }\n                if (good) {\n                    maxi = max(maxi, (int)str.size());\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return maxi;\n    }\n};\n```\nagain, note that this does not work for this problem. nice thinking though!\n\nthe way i did it is by using hash sets, which gives you 2 for loops with at worst O(n^2) time (which won't happen). It involves using ```for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {for int j = i; j < n; j++}```. "

It will solve all the test cases except 985 - 987.\n\nhere is my code which implements your approach:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    bool isCharacterInString(const string& str, char ch) {\n        for (char c : str) {\n            if (c == ch) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int maxi = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int var = min(26, n - i);\n            for (int j = 0; j < var; j++) {\n                string str = s.substr(i, j + 1);\n                string temp = \"\";\n                bool good = true;\n                for (int k = 0; k < str.size(); k++) {\n                    if (isCharacterInString(temp, str[k])) {\n                        good = false;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        temp += str[k];\n                    }\n                }\n                if (good) {\n                    maxi = max(maxi, (int)str.size());\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return maxi;\n    }\n};\n```\nagain, note that this does not work for this problem. nice thinking though!\n\nthe way i did it is by using hash sets, which gives you 2 for loops with at worst O(n^2) time (which won't happen). It involves using ```for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {for int j = i; j < n; j++}```. "

It will solve all the test cases except 985 - 987.\n\nhere is my code which implements your approach:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    bool isCharacterInString(const string& str, char ch) {\n        for (char c : str) {\n            if (c == ch) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int maxi = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int var = min(26, n - i);\n            for (int j = 0; j < var; j++) {\n                string str = s.substr(i, j + 1);\n                string temp = \"\";\n                bool good = true;\n                for (int k = 0; k < str.size(); k++) {\n                    if (isCharacterInString(temp, str[k])) {\n                        good = false;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        temp += str[k];\n                    }\n                }\n                if (good) {\n                    maxi = max(maxi, (int)str.size());\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return maxi;\n    }\n};\n```\nagain, note that this does not work for this problem. nice thinking though!\n\nthe way i did it is by using hash sets, which gives you 2 for loops with at worst O(n^2) time (which won't happen). It involves using ```for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {for int j = i; j < n; j++}```. "

It will solve all the test cases except 985 - 987.\n\nhere is my code which implements your approach:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    bool isCharacterInString(const string& str, char ch) {\n        for (char c : str) {\n            if (c == ch) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int maxi = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int var = min(26, n - i);\n            for (int j = 0; j < var; j++) {\n                string str = s.substr(i, j + 1);\n                string temp = \"\";\n                bool good = true;\n                for (int k = 0; k < str.size(); k++) {\n                    if (isCharacterInString(temp, str[k])) {\n                        good = false;\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        temp += str[k];\n                    }\n                }\n                if (good) {\n                    maxi = max(maxi, (int)str.size());\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return maxi;\n    }\n};\n```\nagain, note that this does not work for this problem. nice thinking though!\n\nthe way i did it is by using hash sets, which gives you 2 for loops with at worst O(n^2) time (which won't happen). It involves using ```for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {for int j = i; j < n; j++}```. "

The way I thought about the runtime was by counting the number of iterations of the innermost 3rd loop (which is in the \"allunique\" function). The number of iterations can be counted as: \\n\\n(2+3+4+...+n) +  (2+3+4+...+n-1)  +  (2+3+4+..+n-2)  + ..... +  (2+3+4)  + (2+3)  + (2)\\n\\nI believe this is the same sum that was written in the official solution using summation notation. However, I didn\\'t really follow the proof that followed, which continued to use summation notation. Could anyone provide an alternate proof that doesn\\'t use summation notation (it just uses the expanded sum that I wrote above)? \\n\\nThanks so much!"

Therefore, the total number of iterations is n(2) + (n-1)(3) + (n-2)(4) + ... + 3(n-2) + 2(n-1) + n, which simplifies to a sum that is on the order of \\u0398(n3)\\u0398(n3) when considering the largest terms."

The number of iterations can be counted as: \\n\\n(2+3+4+...+n) +  (2+3+4+...+n-1)  +  (2+3+4+..+n-2)  + ..... +  (2+3+4)  + (2+3)  + (2)\\n\\nI believe this is the same sum that was written in the official solution using summation notation.

If the input is:\\n\"abcabcbb\"\\nThe problem EXPECTS:\\n\"abc\", for 3 characters\\n\\nIssues with Example 1:\\n* The longest substring without \"repeating characters\" could be read to be \"abcabcb\", for 7 characters. Imagine a sticky key on a keyboard, where \"bbbbbbbb\" is a repeating character. In the word \"basketball\", only the \"ll\" charactes are repeated. It\\'s not immediately obvious from anything in the question why this reading is invalid.\\n* Substring \"abc\" is itself repeated in the input, so why wouldn\\'t characters \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" all count as repeated characters? The answer would be 0, all characters in this example are repeated somewhere in the string.\\n* If we take \"bb\" to be a repeated character, why would the solution contain any \"b\" character at all?\\n\\nExample 3. For the input:\\n\"pwwkew\"\\nThey say the longest substring should be:\\n\"wke\"\\n\\nIssues with Example 3:\\n* All of the same issues per Example 1.\\n* In particular, Example 3 baffles because one of the \"w\" characters repeated as \"ww\" is in the substring. It doesn\\'t make sense why a repeated character would be in the answer.\\n* Problem seems to assume we\\'re parsing left-ro-right, and only keeping the first answer, making one unique solution. Why? If my solution arrives at the longest substring being \"kew\" is this in any way an incorrect solution?\\n\\nSUGGESTED VERBIAGE:\\n\\nProblem. What is the longest substring which can be formed from the input, where all characters in the substring are unique? There may be multiple substrings of the same length.\\n\\nInput. \"abcabcbb\"\\nOutput. 3\\nExplanation. The longest substring is of length 3.

The number of iterations can be counted as: \\n\\n(2+3+4+...+n) +  (2+3+4+...+n-1)  +  (2+3+4+..+n-2)  + ..... +  (2+3+4)  + (2+3)  + (2)\\n\\nI believe this is the same sum that was written in the official solution using summation notation.

If the input is:\\n\"abcabcbb\"\\nThe problem EXPECTS:\\n\"abc\", for 3 characters\\n\\nIssues with Example 1:\\n* The longest substring without \"repeating characters\" could be read to be \"abcabcb\", for 7 characters. Imagine a sticky key on a keyboard, where \"bbbbbbbb\" is a repeating character. In the word \"basketball\", only the \"ll\" charactes are repeated. It\\'s not immediately obvious from anything in the question why this reading is invalid.\\n* Substring \"abc\" is itself repeated in the input, so why wouldn\\'t characters \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" all count as repeated characters? The answer would be 0, all characters in this example are repeated somewhere in the string.\\n* If we take \"bb\" to be a repeated character, why would the solution contain any \"b\" character at all?\\n\\nExample 3. For the input:\\n\"pwwkew\"\\nThey say the longest substring should be:\\n\"wke\"\\n\\nIssues with Example 3:\\n* All of the same issues per Example 1.\\n* In particular, Example 3 baffles because one of the \"w\" characters repeated as \"ww\" is in the substring. It doesn\\'t make sense why a repeated character would be in the answer.\\n* Problem seems to assume we\\'re parsing left-ro-right, and only keeping the first answer, making one unique solution. Why? If my solution arrives at the longest substring being \"kew\" is this in any way an incorrect solution?\\n\\nSUGGESTED VERBIAGE:\\n\\nProblem. What is the longest substring which can be formed from the input, where all characters in the substring are unique? There may be multiple substrings of the same length.\\n\\nInput. \"abcabcbb\"\\nOutput. 3\\nExplanation. The longest substring is of length 3. Longest substrings include \"abc\", \"bca\", and \"cab\".\\n\\nInput. \"pwwkew\"\\nOutput. 3\\nExplanation. The longest substring is of length 3. Longest substrings include \"wke\" and \"kew\"."

The number of iterations can be counted as: \\n\\n(2+3+4+...+n) +  (2+3+4+...+n-1)  +  (2+3+4+..+n-2)  + ..... +  (2+3+4)  + (2+3)  + (2)\\n\\nI believe this is the same sum that was written in the official solution using summation notation.

We keep track of the maximum length encountered so far and return it at the end.\\n \\n \\u0E43\\u0E19\\u0E01\\u0E32\\u0E23\\u0E41\\u0E01\\u0E49\\u0E1B\\u0E31\\u0E0D\\u0E2B\\u0E32\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E49 \\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E43\\u0E0A\\u0E49\\u0E27\\u0E34\\u0E18\\u0E35\\u0E2B\\u0E19\\u0E49\\u0E32\\u0E15\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E07\\u0E1A\\u0E32\\u0E19\\u0E40\\u0E25\\u0E37\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E19 \\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E21\\u0E35\\u0E1E\\u0E2D\\u0E22\\u0E19\\u0E4C\\u0E40\\u0E15\\u0E2D\\u0E23\\u0E4C\\u0E2A\\u0E2D\\u0E07\\u0E15\\u0E31\\u0E27 \\u0E04\\u0E37\\u0E2D\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E14\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E34\\u0E48\\u0E21\\u0E15\\u0E49\\u0E19\\u0E41\\u0E25\\u0E30\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E14\\u0E2A\\u0E34\\u0E49\\u0E19\\u0E2A\\u0E38\\u0E14 \\u0E0B\\u0E36\\u0E48\\u0E07\\u0E41\\u0E2A\\u0E14\\u0E07\\u0E16\\u0E36\\u0E07\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E1A\\u0E40\\u0E02\\u0E15\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E07\\u0E2B\\u0E19\\u0E49\\u0E32\\u0E15\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E07\\u0E1B\\u0E31\\u0E08\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E1A\\u0E31\\u0E19 \\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E22\\u0E31\\u0E07\\u0E23\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E29\\u0E32 charIndexMap \\u0E40\\u0E1E\\u0E37\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E08\\u0E31\\u0E14\\u0E40\\u0E01\\u0E47\\u0E1A\\u0E14\\u0E31\\u0E0A\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E25\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E2A\\u0E38\\u0E14\\u0E17\\u0E35\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E02\\u0E23\\u0E30\\u0E41\\u0E15\\u0E48\\u0E25\\u0E30\\u0E15\\u0E31\\u0E27\\u0E1B\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E01\\u0E0F\\u0E02\\u0E36\\u0E49\\u0E19\\n\\n\\u0E02\\u0E13\\u0E30\\u0E17\\u0E35\\u0E48\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E27\\u0E19\\u0E0B\\u0E49\\u0E33\\u0E43\\u0E19\\u0E2A\\u0E15\\u0E23\\u0E34\\u0E07 \\u0E2B\\u0E32\\u0E01\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E1E\\u0E1A\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E02\\u0E23\\u0E30\\u0E17\\u0E35\\u0E48\\u0E40\\u0E04\\u0E22\\u0E40\\u0E2B\\u0E47\\u0E19\\u0E21\\u0E32\\u0E01\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E19\\u0E41\\u0E25\\u0E30\\u0E14\\u0E31\\u0E0A\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E2D\\u0E22\\u0E39\\u0E48\\u0E20\\u0E32\\u0E22\\u0E43\\u0E19\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E1A\\u0E40\\u0E02\\u0E15\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E07\\u0E2B\\u0E19\\u0E49\\u0E32\\u0E15\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E07\\u0E1B\\u0E31\\u0E08\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E1A\\u0E31\\u0E19 \\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E08\\u0E30\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E1B\\u0E40\\u0E14\\u0E15\\u0E15\\u0E31\\u0E27\\u0E0A\\u0E35\\u0E49\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E34\\u0E48\\u0E21\\u0E15\\u0E49\\u0E19\\u0E43\\u0E2B\\u0E49\\u0E40\\u0E25\\u0E37\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E19\\u0E44\\u0E1B\\u0E17\\u0E32\\u0E07\\u0E02\\u0E27\\u0E32\\u0E2B\\u0E25\\u0E31\\u0E07\\u0E08\\u0E32\\u0E01\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E02\\u0E23\\u0E30\\u0E19\\u0E31\\u0E49\\u0E19\\u0E1B\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E01\\u0E0F\\u0E02\\u0E36\\u0E49\\u0E19\\u0E04\\u0E23\\u0E31\\u0E49\\u0E07\\u0E25\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E2A\\u0E38\\u0E14 \\u0E2A\\u0E34\\u0E48\\u0E07\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E49\\u0E17\\u0E33\\u0E43\\u0E2B\\u0E49\\u0E41\\u0E19\\u0E48\\u0E43\\u0E08\\u0E27\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E04\\u0E07\\u0E2A\\u0E15\\u0E23\\u0E34\\u0E07\\u0E22\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E22\\u0E44\\u0E27\\u0E49\\u0E42\\u0E14\\u0E22\\u0E44\\u0E21\\u0E48\\u0E21\\u0E35\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E02\\u0E23\\u0E30\\u0E0B\\u0E49\\u0E33\\n\\n\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E1B\\u0E40\\u0E14\\u0E15 charIndexMap \\u0E14\\u0E49\\u0E27\\u0E22\\u0E14\\u0E31\\u0E0A\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E07\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E02\\u0E23\\u0E30\\u0E1B\\u0E31\\u0E08\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E1A\\u0E31\\u0E19 \\u0E41\\u0E25\\u0E30\\u0E04\\u0E33\\u0E19\\u0E27\\u0E13\\u0E04\\u0E27\\u0E32\\u0E21\\u0E22\\u0E32\\u0E27\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E07\\u0E2A\\u0E15\\u0E23\\u0E34\\u0E07\\u0E22\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E22\\u0E1B\\u0E31\\u0E08\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E1A\\u0E31\\u0E19 \\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E15\\u0E34\\u0E14\\u0E15\\u0E32\\u0E21\\u0E04\\u0E27\\u0E32\\u0E21\\u0E22\\u0E32\\u0E27\\u0E2A\\u0E39\\u0E07\\u0E2A\\u0E38\\u0E14\\u0E17\\u0E35\\u0E48\\u0E1E\\u0E1A\\u0E08\\u0E19\\u0E16\\u0E36\\u0E07\\u0E15\\u0E2D\\u0E19\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E49\\u0E41\\u0E25\\u0E30\\u0E2A\\u0E48\\u0E07\\u0E04\\u0E37\\u0E19\\u0E43\\u0E19\\u0E15\\u0E2D\\u0E19\\u0E17\\u0E49\\u0E32\\u0E22\\n \\n */\\n``````"

We also maintain a charIndexMap to store the most recent index where each character appeared.\\n\\nAs we iterate through the string, if we encounter a character that has been seen before and its index is within the current window\\'s boundaries, we update the start pointer to move right after the last occurrence of that character. This ensures that we\\'re maintaining a substring without repeating characters.\\n\\nWe update the charIndexMap with the current character\\'s index and calculate the length of the current substring.

We maintain two pointers, start and end, representing the current window\\'s boundaries. We also maintain a charIndexMap to store the most recent index where each character appeared.\\n\\nAs we iterate through the string, if we encounter a character that has been seen before and its index is within the current window\\'s boundaries, we update the start pointer to move right after the last occurrence of that character. This ensures that we\\'re maintaining a substring without repeating characters.\\n\\nWe update the charIndexMap with the current character\\'s index and calculate the length of the current substring. We keep track of the maximum length encountered so far and return it at the end.\\n \\n \\u0E43\\u0E19\\u0E01\\u0E32\\u0E23\\u0E41\\u0E01\\u0E49\\u0E1B\\u0E31\\u0E0D\\u0E2B\\u0E32\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E49 \\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E43\\u0E0A\\u0E49\\u0E27\\u0E34\\u0E18\\u0E35\\u0E2B\\u0E19\\u0E49\\u0E32\\u0E15\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E07\\u0E1A\\u0E32\\u0E19\\u0E40\\u0E25\\u0E37\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E19 \\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E21\\u0E35\\u0E1E\\u0E2D\\u0E22\\u0E19\\u0E4C\\u0E40\\u0E15\\u0E2D\\u0E23\\u0E4C\\u0E2A\\u0E2D\\u0E07\\u0E15\\u0E31\\u0E27 \\u0E04\\u0E37\\u0E2D\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E14\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E34\\u0E48\\u0E21\\u0E15\\u0E49\\u0E19\\u0E41\\u0E25\\u0E30\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E14\\u0E2A\\u0E34\\u0E49\\u0E19\\u0E2A\\u0E38\\u0E14 \\u0E0B\\u0E36\\u0E48\\u0E07\\u0E41\\u0E2A\\u0E14\\u0E07\\u0E16\\u0E36\\u0E07\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E1A\\u0E40\\u0E02\\u0E15\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E07\\u0E2B\\u0E19\\u0E49\\u0E32\\u0E15\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E07\\u0E1B\\u0E31\\u0E08\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E1A\\u0E31\\u0E19 \\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E22\\u0E31\\u0E07\\u0E23\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E29\\u0E32 charIndexMap \\u0E40\\u0E1E\\u0E37\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E08\\u0E31\\u0E14\\u0E40\\u0E01\\u0E47\\u0E1A\\u0E14\\u0E31\\u0E0A\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E25\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E2A\\u0E38\\u0E14\\u0E17\\u0E35\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E02\\u0E23\\u0E30\\u0E41\\u0E15\\u0E48\\u0E25\\u0E30\\u0E15\\u0E31\\u0E27\\u0E1B\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E01\\u0E0F\\u0E02\\u0E36\\u0E49\\u0E19\\n\\n\\u0E02\\u0E13\\u0E30\\u0E17\\u0E35\\u0E48\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E27\\u0E19\\u0E0B\\u0E49\\u0E33\\u0E43\\u0E19\\u0E2A\\u0E15\\u0E23\\u0E34\\u0E07 \\u0E2B\\u0E32\\u0E01\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E1E\\u0E1A\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E02\\u0E23\\u0E30\\u0E17\\u0E35\\u0E48\\u0E40\\u0E04\\u0E22\\u0E40\\u0E2B\\u0E47\\u0E19\\u0E21\\u0E32\\u0E01\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E19\\u0E41\\u0E25\\u0E30\\u0E14\\u0E31\\u0E0A\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E2D\\u0E22\\u0E39\\u0E48\\u0E20\\u0E32\\u0E22\\u0E43\\u0E19\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E1A\\u0E40\\u0E02\\u0E15\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E07\\u0E2B\\u0E19\\u0E49\\u0E32\\u0E15\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E07\\u0E1B\\u0E31\\u0E08\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E1A\\u0E31\\u0E19 \\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E08\\u0E30\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E1B\\u0E40\\u0E14\\u0E15\\u0E15\\u0E31\\u0E27\\u0E0A\\u0E35\\u0E49\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E34\\u0E48\\u0E21\\u0E15\\u0E49\\u0E19\\u0E43\\u0E2B\\u0E49\\u0E40\\u0E25\\u0E37\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E19\\u0E44\\u0E1B\\u0E17\\u0E32\\u0E07\\u0E02\\u0E27\\u0E32\\u0E2B\\u0E25\\u0E31\\u0E07\\u0E08\\u0E32\\u0E01\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E02\\u0E23\\u0E30\\u0E19\\u0E31\\u0E49\\u0E19\\u0E1B\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E01\\u0E0F\\u0E02\\u0E36\\u0E49\\u0E19\\u0E04\\u0E23\\u0E31\\u0E49\\u0E07\\u0E25\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E2A\\u0E38\\u0E14 \\u0E2A\\u0E34\\u0E48\\u0E07\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E49\\u0E17\\u0E33\\u0E43\\u0E2B\\u0E49\\u0E41\\u0E19\\u0E48\\u0E43\\u0E08\\u0E27\\u0E48\\u0E32\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E04\\u0E07\\u0E2A\\u0E15\\u0E23\\u0E34\\u0E07\\u0E22\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E22\\u0E44\\u0E27\\u0E49\\u0E42\\u0E14\\u0E22\\u0E44\\u0E21\\u0E48\\u0E21\\u0E35\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E02\\u0E23\\u0E30\\u0E0B\\u0E49\\u0E33\\n\\n\\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E1B\\u0E40\\u0E14\\u0E15 charIndexMap \\u0E14\\u0E49\\u0E27\\u0E22\\u0E14\\u0E31\\u0E0A\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E07\\u0E2D\\u0E31\\u0E01\\u0E02\\u0E23\\u0E30\\u0E1B\\u0E31\\u0E08\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E1A\\u0E31\\u0E19 \\u0E41\\u0E25\\u0E30\\u0E04\\u0E33\\u0E19\\u0E27\\u0E13\\u0E04\\u0E27\\u0E32\\u0E21\\u0E22\\u0E32\\u0E27\\u0E02\\u0E2D\\u0E07\\u0E2A\\u0E15\\u0E23\\u0E34\\u0E07\\u0E22\\u0E48\\u0E2D\\u0E22\\u0E1B\\u0E31\\u0E08\\u0E08\\u0E38\\u0E1A\\u0E31\\u0E19 \\u0E40\\u0E23\\u0E32\\u0E15\\u0E34\\u0E14\\u0E15\\u0E32\\u0E21\\u0E04\\u0E27\\u0E32\\u0E21\\u0E22\\u0E32\\u0E27\\u0E2A\\u0E39\\u0E07\\u0E2A\\u0E38\\u0E14\\u0E17\\u0E35\\u0E48\\u0E1E\\u0E1A\\u0E08\\u0E19\\u0E16\\u0E36\\u0E07\\u0E15\\u0E2D\\u0E19\\u0E19\\u0E35\\u0E49\\u0E41\\u0E25\\u0E30\\u0E2A\\u0E48\\u0E07\\u0E04\\u0E37\\u0E19\\u0E43\\u0E19\\u0E15\\u0E2D\\u0E19\\u0E17\\u0E49\\u0E32\\u0E22\\n \\n */\\n``````"

In this context, it\\'s very difficult to understand how Example 3 makes sense, because the answer would seem to be 2 (\"pw\"), since we\\'d stop as soon as we found the second \"w\".\\n\\nUnder the second parsing of the sentence, in which \"without repeating characters\" refers to the substring, all 3 examples make sense, because it\\'s looking at the longest substring, WHICH does not have repeating characters.  \\n\\nAfter a lot of work, interpreting the problem the first way, I finally realized this.

And this is why we do another round of while loop.\\nInstead incrementing and decrementing respective, `l` and `r`, we decrement and increment respective `l` and `r`.\\nThinking about it as adjusting lower bound and upper bound is better.\\nThis adjustment depends on two things: Minimum and maximum values of array `nums[l:r+1]`.\\nNow, we decrement `l` value until we find something that is lower than minimum.\\nAlso, we increment `r` value until we find something that is greater than maximum.\\n\\nAfter all that you just need to do `l + r - 1`.\\n\\nI hope this helped everyone.\\n\\nAnalysis:\\nAt worst case, `nums` is already sorted: `O(2n) = O(n)` \\nAt worst case, `nums` is not sorted bound begins in the middle and two values are min and max of entire array: `O(2n) = O(n)`\\nSpace complexity: Using only 5 variables and it is constant: `O(5) = O(1)`\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, nums):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type nums: List[int]\\n        :rtype: int\\n        \"\"\"\\n        if len(nums) < 2: return 0\\n        \\n        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1\\n        \\n        while l < len(nums) - 1 and nums[l] <= nums[l + 1]:\\n            l += 1\\n        \\n        while r > 0 and nums[r] >= nums[r -1]:\\n            r -= 1\\n            \\n        if l > r:\\n            return 0\\n            \\n        temp = nums[l:r+1]\\n        tempMin = min(temp)\\n        tempMax = max(temp)\\n        \\n        while l > 0 and tempMin < nums[l-1]:\\n            l -= 1\\n        \\n        while r < len(nums) - 1 and tempMax > nums[r+1]:\\n            r += 1\\n            \\n        return r - l + 1\\n```\\n\\nModified for O(1) space, thanks to @EdmondDantes14\\n```py\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, nums):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type nums: List[int]\\n        :rtype: int\\n        \"\"\"\\n        def find_min_max(l, r):\\n            local_minimum = float(\\'inf\\')\\n            local_maximum = float(\\'-inf\\')\\n            for i in xrange(l, r+1):\\n                if i == len(nums):\\n                    break\\n                local_minimum = min(local_minimum, nums[i])\\n                local_maximum = max(local_maximum, nums[i])\\n                \\n            return local_minimum, local_maximum\\n                \\n        if len(nums) < 2: return 0\\n        \\n        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1\\n        \\n        while l < len(nums) - 1 and nums[l] <= nums[l + 1]:\\n            l += 1\\n        \\n        while r > 0 and nums[r] >= nums[r -1]:\\n            r -= 1\\n            \\n        if l > r:\\n            return 0\\n            \\n        tempMin, tempMax = find_min_max(l, r+1)\\n        \\n        while l > 0 and tempMin < nums[l-1]:\\n            l -= 1\\n        \\n        while r < len(nums) - 1 and tempMax > nums[r+1]:\\n            r += 1\\n            \\n        return r - l + 1\\n```",

We can do a linear or binary search to get this. (or implement upper_bound, lower_bound provided by c++ stl). This will give us the required l. In our example, the position of 4 should be at index 2, which we can calculate using upper_bound from 0 to l.\\n\\nSimilarly, we need to find the proper position of maxi in [r + 1, n).

We use  [1, 3, 3, 2, 8, 10, 0, 15] as the example. We use `max` to record the largest value we visited. If it's a sorted array, then `max` should be equal to the last element we visited. We only update `start` and `end` when `max` is less then the next element we visit. The process is as follows: \\n     \\nWhen i =0, max = nums[0] = 1;\\n\\nWhen i=1, max = nums[1] = 3;\\n\\nWhen i=2, max = nums[1] = 3;\\n\\nWhen i =3, we find that max < nums[3], then it means that we find  a unsorted subarray. Since `start ==-1`, so we know it is the beginning of the unsorted  subarray, then update `start = i-1=2` and `end =i+1 = 4` (actually `end -1` should be the end of the unsorted subarray, but we use `end -start` to count the length of the unsorted subarray so we let `end =i+1`). Because, there might be duplicates in the array (like nums[1] = nums[2] = 3), we need to go back to check whether `nums[start-1] == nums[start]`. Then we update `start = 1`.\\n\\nWhen i =4, max = nums[4] = 8.\\n\\nWhen i =5, max = nums[5] = 10.\\n\\nWhen i =6, we find that max < nums[6]. So we update   `end =i+1 = 7` . Now we need to update `start`, since `start` does not equal to `-1` which means that we already have a start. So what need to do is to update `start` so that `nums[start] < =nums[i]` or we arrive the beginning of the array. Finally we update `start = 0` here.\\nwhen i =7,  max = nums[7] = 15.\\n\\nFinally we return `end - start` which is 7-0=7.",

If you like this solution or find it useful,* ***please upvote*** *this post.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Idea:***\\n\\nThe easiest approach here would be to simply sort a copy of the input array (**N**) and then compare both ends of the two arrays from the outside inward to see how many elements they had in common. The distance between the first discrepancy on either end will be our answer. This solution would be **O(N log N) time**, but we can do better.\\n\\nTo solve this problem in **O(N) time**, we have to consider just how we can tell if one end of an array is properly sorted. For starters, we can easily tell that the left end subarray breaks sort order when an element if smaller than the one before it.\\n\\nAt that point, we know that the subarray is sorted with respect to itself, but what about with respect to the *entire* array? Unfortunately, we can only be sure of this once we\\'ve seen every element in the array.\\n\\nThis should point us to our solution: we have to, in essence, iterate backwards from each end of the array in order to find out how many elements on the opposite end are in their proper position. So we will iterate from right to left to figure out how many elements at the left end of the array are correct, and then vice versa from left to right for the right end.\\n\\nWe can do this by keeping track of the **max** (going left to right) and **min** (going right to left) elements seen so far and noting the last time an element wasn\\'t the same as the **max** or **min** values, depending on direction (**left** and **right**).\\n\\nWe can calculate the length of the mid subarray from **left** and **right** and then **return** the answer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Implementation:***\\n\\nRather than performing more calculations on each iteration to store the correct positions for **left** and **right**, we can just store **i** and do our calculation once at the very end instead.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Javascript Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **76ms / 41.6MB** (beats 100% / 80%).\\n```javascript\\nvar findUnsortedSubarray = function(N) {\\n    let len = N.length - 1, left = -1, right = -1,\\n        max = N[0], min = N[len]\\n    for (let i = 1; i <= len; i++) {\\n        let a = N[i], b = N[len-i]\\n        a < max ? right = i : max = a\\n        b > min ? left = i : min = b\\n    }\\n    return Math.max(0, left + right - len + 1)\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Python Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **192ms / 15.2MB** (beats 88% / 91%).\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, N: List[int]) -> int:\\n        lenN, left, right = len(N) - 1, -1, -1\\n        maxN, minN = N[0], N[lenN]\\n        for i in range(1, len(N)):\\n            a, b = N[i], N[lenN-i]\\n            if a < maxN: right = i\\n            else: maxN = a\\n            if b > minN: left = i\\n            else: minN = b\\n        return max(0, left + right - lenN + 1)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Java Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **1ms / 40.1MB** (beats 100% / 83%).\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int findUnsortedSubarray(int[] N) {\\n        int len = N.length - 1, left = -1, right = -1,\\n            max = N[0], min = N[len];\\n        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {\\n            int a = N[i], b = N[len-i];\\n            if (a < max) right = i;\\n            else max = a;\\n            if (b > min) left = i;\\n            else min = b;\\n        }\\n        return Math.max(0, left + right - len + 1);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***C++ Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **20ms / 26.4MB** (beats 98% / 90%).\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findUnsortedSubarray(vector<int>& N) {\\n        int len = N.size() - 1, left = -1, right = -1,\\n            maxN = N[0], minN = N[len];\\n        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {\\n            int a = N[i], b = N[len-i];\\n            if (a < maxN) right = i;\\n            else maxN = a;\\n            if (b > minN) left = i;\\n            else minN = b;\\n        }\\n        return max(0, left + right - len + 1);\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "The goal of this problem is to find two numbers `beg` and `end`, such that difference of them is as small as possible and also such that if we sort nums from `beg` to `end` we will have fully sorted data.\\n \\n Let `run_max` be running maximum of `nums`.\\n\\n What is the `end` pointer? It is the smallest value such that\\n \\n `max(nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[end]) <= nums[end + 1] <= nums[end + 2] <= ... <= nums[-1]`:\\n \\n first inequality holds, because after we sort data inside, we still need to be less than `nums[end + 1]`, and the rest inequalites are definition that data after `end` is already sorted.\\n \\n Now, let us start from the end of our data and move to the left, checking if condtion holds. While it holds, we decrease `end` by one. Then we check if we reached `0` and if we did, we can immedietly return `0`, because data is sorted. If not, we do similar logic, starting with beginning of our data and moving to the right.\\n \\n **Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, we iterate just several times through our data. Space complexity is also `O(n)`, which can also be reduced to `O(1)`, but in my opinion the solution becomes much less intuitive.\\n \\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, nums):\\n        nums = [-float(\"inf\")] + nums + [float(\"inf\")]\\n        run_max = list(accumulate(nums, max))\\n        run_min = list(accumulate(nums[::-1], min))[::-1]\\n        \\n        end, beg = len(nums) - 1, 0\\n\\n        while nums[end-1] <= nums[end] and run_max[end-1] <= nums[end - 1]:\\n            end -= 1\\n            \\n        if end == 0: return 0\\n            \\n        while nums[beg+1] >= nums[beg] and run_min[beg+1] >= nums[beg + 1]:\\n            beg += 1\\n            \\n        return end - beg - 1\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any question, feel free to ask.

                "content": "Solving it sorting a copy of the vector and comparing it to the input is trivial; and rather expensive.\\n\\nWe can do better.\\n\\nAnd to do better, we first of all need to find the first and the final segment of the vector which are sorted (either of them might be empty - ie: 0 sorted elements) and then work on the central part which is not.\\n\\nWe start declaring a few variables:\\n* `i` and `j` are our pointers, respectively pointing to the first (`0`) and last (`nums.size() - 1`) element of the input;\\n* `vMin` and `vMax` will be used later, to find the lowest and highest value in the unsorted central part.\\n\\nWe will then move `i` left and `j` right until they point to sorted elements and do not cross each other, so that we will know that the `[0, i]` and `[j, nums.size() - 1]` segments are sorted, while `[i + 1, j - 1]` is not.\\n\\nNow, if `i == j` our life is easier: the vector is fully sorted and we can just return `0` directly.\\n\\nIf not, we need to figure out `vMin` and `vMax` as the lowest and highest value respectively in `[i + 1, j - 1]`, setting them to the values immediately before it.\\n\\nNote: we can be sure that at least one of them will be different from the initial value, since otherwise we would be dealing with an already sorted vector if `nums[i] <= vMin <= vMax <= nums[j]`.\\n\\nOnce we found the value(s) of the central part that need(s) to be relocated, we might be tempted to just go and linearly check where in the first or last segment `vMin` or `vMax` might respectively go.\\n\\nAnd that would work, but since we know that `[0, i]` and `[j, nums.size() - 1]` are indeed sorted, we have a more powerful way to get things done: binary search will find us where to insert them in logarithmic time!\\n\\nSince I felt lazy by this point, I just used `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` respectively to know where to place `vMin` and `vMax` and thus update the values of `i` and `j` if needed, but be ready to write your own function in an interview.\\n\\nOnce done, we can just return `j - i` to know how many elements are in the range that needs to be sorted :)\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int findUnsortedSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        // support variables\\n        int i = 0, j = nums.size() - 1, vMin, vMax;\\n        // moving i to the first unsorted element\\n        while (i < j && nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]) i++;\\n        // moving i to the first unsorted element\\n        while (i < j && nums[j] >= nums[j - 1]) j--;\\n        // edge case: all sorted\\n        if (j == i) return 0;\\n        // finding vMin and vMax\\n        vMin = nums[i], vMax = nums[j];\\n        for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {\\n            vMin = min(nums[k], vMin);\\n            vMax = max(nums[k], vMax);\\n        }\\n        // moving i and j to the newer positions, if needed\\n        if (vMin < nums[i]) i = upper_bound(begin(nums), begin(nums) + i, vMin) - begin(nums);\\n        if (vMax > nums[j]) j = lower_bound(begin(nums) + j, end(nums), vMax) - begin(nums);\\n        return j - i;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Make a sorted copy of the input array nums and store it in the variable sorted_nums.\\n2. Initialize two variables start and end to invalid indices. We will use these to keep track of the start and end of the shortest unsorted subarray.\\n3. Use a loop to iterate over all elements of the input array nums.\\n4. Check if the current element nums[i] is not equal to the corresponding element in the sorted array sorted_nums[i].\\n5. Update start to be the minimum of its current value and i.\\n6. Update end to be the maximum of its current value and i.\\n7. After the loop completes, check if end - start >= 0. If it is, then the array has at least one unsorted subarray, so return end - start + 1.\\n8. If end - start < 0, then the array is already sorted, so return 0.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)  # make a sorted copy of the original array\\n        start, end = len(nums), 0  # initialize start and end to invalid indices\\n        \\n        # find the leftmost element that is out of order\\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\\n            if nums[i] != sorted_nums[i]:\\n                start = min(start, i)\\n                end = max(end, i)\\n        \\n        return end - start + 1 if end - start >= 0 else 0  # Return length of shortest unsorted subarray, or 0 if array is already sorted\\n```",

Some of them just combine two loops into one. But each element is visited twice but not once. This solution provides a **one-pass** solution. \\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe main idea is the same. Let the solution be [$left$, $right$].  Then, $left$ is the first index with a smaller element on its right side, and $right$ is last index with a larger element on it left side. We can find $right$ by sweeping from left to right and keeping the prefix minimum. Similar for finding $left$. But it takes two passes, either in two loops or one loops.\\n\\nThe improvement here is as follows.\\nFirst, go forward from head to find the longest nondecreasing sequence $nums[0]$ ~ $nums[i]$. Similarly, go backward from tail to find the longest nondecreasing sequence $nums[j]$ ~ $nums[n-1]$. \\nThen we find the maximum ($pmax$) and minimum ($pmin$) in the range $[i, j]$. So far, each element is visited exactly once. Finally, $left$ can be found by performing binary seach $pmin$ in the nondecreasing sequence $nums[0]$ ~ $nums[i]$.

So how about just creating a copy of the array, sorting it and checking how many elements are correctly placed. \\n\\nTo be precise, we need to check how many elements in the **prefix and suffix** of the given original array match with that of the sorted array. Let\\'s say the total elements matching in the prefix and the suffix is `x`. Then we just need to return `n - x` as these are the middle `n - x ` elements that need to be sorted.\\n\\n### Implementation:\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        n = len(nums)\\n        arr = nums[:]\\n        arr.sort()\\n        \\n        lo, hi = 0, n - 1\\n        cnt = 0\\n        while lo <= hi and nums[lo] == arr[lo]:\\n            cnt += 1\\n            lo += 1\\n        \\n        while hi >= lo and nums[hi] == arr[hi]:\\n            cnt += 1\\n            hi -= 1\\n            \\n        return n - cnt\\n```\\n\\n**Time Complexity:** O(n * log n)\\n**Space Complexity:** O(n)\\n\\n\\n\\n# Better solution:\\n\\nIf we observe carefully, what we intend to do is mark as many elements in the prefix and suffix as good and exclude them from the unsorted contigous subarray. So how to determine if an element is good ? Well an element is good if it is not involved in an **inversion**. \\n\\nLet `right` be the index of the rightmost element involved in a inversion.\\nLet `left` be the index of the leftmost element involved in a inversion.\\n\\nThese indices are the **boundaries of our unsorted contigous subarray.**\\n\\nSo now we can simply return `right - left + 1` as our answer.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findUnsortedSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\\n        n = len(nums)\\n        \\n        right = -1\\n        mx = nums[0]\\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\\n            if mx > num:\\n                right = i\\n            mx = max(mx, num)\\n            \\n        left = -1\\n        mn = nums[n - 1]\\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\\n            num = nums[i]\\n            if mn < num:\\n                left = i \\n            mn = min(mn, num)\\n        \\n        return right - left + 1 if left != -1 else 0\\n```\\n\\n**Time Complexity:** O(n)\\n**Space Complexity:** O(1)\\n\\n**Have a nice day!**\\n",

If you are having difficulties understanding the solution section or the solutions posted, this might help.\\n\\n**Intuition and approach** :\\nIn the best case scenario the shortest subarray (i,j) will be the one that is bounded  by two pairs of sorted arrays. one from 0 to i and one from j to len-1. But the subarray (i,j) can have numbers that are :\\n* Smaller than the numbers in the left subarray\\n* Bigger than the numbers in the right subarray \\n\\nIf thats the case then we need to include them as well. So we increase the boundaries by moving i towards the left and j towards the right.\\n\\n**Code**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int findUnsortedSubarray(int[] nums) {\\n        int i = 0, j = nums.length-1;\\n        \\n        while(i < nums.length-1 && nums[i] <= nums[i+1]) i++; // finding sorted position.\\n        if (i == nums.length-1) return 0; // fully sorted\\n        while(j > 0 && nums[j] >= nums[j-1]) j--; //finding sorted pos from end of array\\n        \\n        //increasing boundaries while going through our best case subarray\\n        for (int m = i; m <= j; m++) {\\n            while(i>0 && nums[m] < nums[i-1]) i--; // remember that 0 to i-1 is already sorted.\\n            while(j<nums.length-1 && nums[m] > nums[j+1]) j++; // similarly j to length-1 is also sorted.\\n        }\\n        \\n        return j-i+1; \\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSuggestions are always welcome. \\nAnd do let me know if you see any discrepancy in my solution.",

For each spot, ask the following:\\n1. If i != nums.Length - 1 and nums[i] is greater than nums[i + 1]:\\nIf start is equal to -1, assign start = i.\\nRegardless of the above, assign end to i + 1 and then calculate the minimum of (min, nums[i], nums[i + 1]) and store that in min.

So, now we need to loop over the array from back to front and check simply:\\nis nums[i] greater than min and less than or equal to max? If yes, update start to equal i. Because we\\'re going backwards, start will end at the lowest index that it can.\\n\\nFinally, return end minus start plus one. We add one because lets say our start and end were 0 and 1, thats two elements. But end minus start would return 1, so we need to artificially add that extra element to match.\\n\\nand that\\'s it!

If i != nums.Length - 1 and nums[i] is greater than nums[i + 1]:\\nIf start is equal to -1, assign start = i.\\nRegardless of the above, assign end to i + 1 and then calculate the minimum of (min, nums[i], nums[i + 1]) and store that in min.

So, now we need to loop over the array from back to front and check simply:\\nis nums[i] greater than min and less than or equal to max? If yes, update start to equal i. Because we\\'re going backwards, start will end at the lowest index that it can.\\n\\nFinally, return end minus start plus one.
