Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.\nAll of the tickets belong to a man who departs from \"JFK\", thus, the itinerary must begin with \"JFK\". If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.\n\n\tFor example, the itinerary [\"JFK\", \"LGA\"] has a smaller lexical order than [\"JFK\", \"LGB\"].\n\nYou may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.\n&nbsp;\nExample 1:\n\nInput: tickets = [[\"MUC\",\"LHR\"],[\"JFK\",\"MUC\"],[\"SFO\",\"SJC\"],[\"LHR\",\"SFO\"]]\nOutput: [\"JFK\",\"MUC\",\"LHR\",\"SFO\",\"SJC\"]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: tickets = [[\"JFK\",\"SFO\"],[\"JFK\",\"ATL\"],[\"SFO\",\"ATL\"],[\"ATL\",\"JFK\"],[\"ATL\",\"SFO\"]]\nOutput: [\"JFK\",\"ATL\",\"JFK\",\"SFO\",\"ATL\",\"SFO\"]\nExplanation: Another possible reconstruction is [\"JFK\",\"SFO\",\"ATL\",\"JFK\",\"ATL\",\"SFO\"] but it is larger in lexical order.\n\n&nbsp;\nConstraints:\n\n\t1 <= tickets.length <= 300\n\ttickets[i].length == 2\n\tfromi.length == 3\n\ttoi.length == 3\n\tfromi and toi consist of uppercase English letters.\n\tfromi != toi",

                "content": "The nice thing about DFS is it tries a path, and if that\\'s wrong (i.e. path does not lead to solution), DFS goes one step back and tries another path. It continues to do so until we\\'ve found the correct path (which leads to the solution). You need to always bear this nice feature in mind when utilizing DFS to solve problems.\\n\\nIn this problem, the path we are going to find is an itinerary which:\\n1. uses all tickets to travel among airports\\n2. preferably in ascending lexical order of airport code\\n\\nKeep in mind that requirement 1 must be satisfied before we consider 2. If we always choose the airport with the smallest lexical order, this would lead to a perfectly lexical-ordered itinerary, but pay attention that when doing so, there can be a \"dead end\" somewhere in the tickets such that we are not able visit all airports (or we can\\'t use all our tickets), which is bad because it fails to satisfy requirement 1 of this problem. Thus we need to take a step back and try other possible airports, which might not give us a perfectly ordered solution, but will use all tickets and cover all airports.\\n\\nThus it\\'s natural to think about the \"backtracking\" feature of DFS. We start by building a graph and then sorting vertices in the adjacency list so that when we traverse the graph later, we can guarantee the lexical order of the itinerary can be as good as possible. When we have generated an itinerary, we check if we have used all our airline tickets. If not, we revert the change and try another ticket.

Starting from the starting vertex `v`, we build a path by adding at each step an edge that has not yet been passed and is adjacent to the current vertex. The vertices of the path are accumulated in stack `S`. When the moment comes when for the current node `w` all the incident edges have already passed, we write the vertices from `S` in output until we meet the node where the incident has not passed yet edges. Then we continue our traversal of the unattended edges. It can be written both with recursion or with stack, recursion version is shorter.\\n\\nHere is a link, where you can plunge deeper into this:\\nhttp://www.graph-magics.com/articles/euler.php\\n\\nIf you neves saw this problem and even if you know what **Euler path** is, I think it is almost impossible to invent this algorighm by yourself, and this problem should be marked as **hard**.\\n\\n**Complexity**: time and space complexity of usual Euler Path Finding algorighm is `O(E+V) = O(E)`, because we traverse each edge only once and number of edges is more than number of vertixes - 1 in Eulerian graph.

                "content": "# Comprehensive Guide to Solving \"Reconstruct Itinerary\": Navigating Airports Like a Pro\\n\\n## Introduction & Problem Statement\\n\\nHello, coding enthusiasts! Today, we\\'ll tackle a problem that combines graph theory and real-world scenarios: \"Reconstruct Itinerary.\" The problem asks you to reconstruct a trip\\'s itinerary given a list of airline tickets. The catch? You start from JFK airport, and if there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the one that has the smallest lexical order.\\n\\n## Key Concepts and Constraints\\n\\n### What Makes This Problem Unique?\\n\\n1. **Graph Theory**: \\n   The problem can be modeled as a directed graph, where each airport is a node and each ticket represents a directed edge between airports.\\n  \\n2. **Lexical Order**: \\n   Among multiple valid itineraries, the one with the smallest lexical order is preferred.\\n\\n3. **Constraints**: \\n   - 1 <= tickets.length <= 300\\n   - Tickets are given as pairs [fromi, toi] of strings.\\n   - Each string consists of 3 uppercase English letters.\\n\\n### Strategies to Tackle the Problem\\n\\n1. **Recursive DFS**: \\n   This approach leverages the stack memory implicitly during recursion to backtrack and form the itinerary.\\n   \\n2. **Iterative DFS**: \\n   This approach explicitly uses a stack to perform DFS iteratively.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Live Coding & More in Python\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=migy5oXV1Uc\\n\\n## Recursive DFS Explained\\n\\n### Extended Explanation: Logic Behind the \"Find Itinerary\" Solution using Recursive DFS\\n\\n### What is Recursive DFS?\\n\\nDFS, short for Depth-First Search, is a graph-traversal algorithm. In this specific problem, we use the recursive version of DFS, which exploits the call stack to keep track of the airports (vertices) that still need exploration.\\n\\n### The Intricacies of Recursive DFS in \"Find Itinerary\"\\n\\n1. **Initialize the Graph**:  \\n    - We start by initializing an adjacency list `graph` that will serve as a representation of the directed graph of flights. The graph is implemented as a defaultdict containing lists.\\n  \\n    - The adjacency list is constructed by iterating over the given list of ticket pairs, where each pair consists of a source airport and a destination airport.\\n  \\n    - These lists of destinations are sorted in reverse lexical order. This allows us to pop the last element to ensure that we are choosing the smallest lexical order when there are multiple options.\\n\\n2. **DFS Traversal and Exploration**:  \\n    - The traversal starts from the JFK airport, which is our initial point. We initiate a recursive DFS function that takes the current airport as an argument.\\n  \\n    - Inside this function, we enter a loop that continues until we find an airport that has no more destinations left to visit. This is done by checking the adjacency list for each airport and popping the last element (which is the smallest in lexical order).\\n  \\n    - During this process, we recursively call the DFS function for each new destination, essentially diving deeper into the graph.\\n\\n3. **Backtrack and Construct Itinerary**:  \\n    - Once we reach an airport with no outgoing edges, or in other words, no more destinations to visit, we start backtracking.\\n  \\n    - During the backtracking phase, we add the current airport to our `itinerary` list. This list was initially empty and serves as the container for our final solution.\\n\\n    - Importantly, we are essentially building the itinerary in reverse during this phase because of the way DFS works. As we backtrack, we are popping from the call stack, revisiting the airports in the reverse order of how they will eventually appear in the itinerary.\\n\\n4. **Reverse to Get the Final Itinerary**:  \\n    - Since we constructed the itinerary in reverse, the final step is to reverse this list. This gives us the correct order of airports to visit, starting from JFK, and is our final solution.\\n\\n### Time and Space Complexity\\n\\n- **Time Complexity**: $$O(N \\\\log N)$$ due to sorting the tickets.\\n- **Space Complexity**: $$O(N)$$, for storing the graph and the itinerary.\\n\\n# Code Recursive \\n``` Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]])

initializing the graph in the same manner as the recursive approach. The difference lies in the traversal and the building of the itinerary.\\n\\n1. **Initialize Stack**:  \\n   - We explicitly initialize a stack with \"JFK\" as the starting point.\\n  \\n2. **Iterative DFS Traversal**:  \\n   - We use the stack to manage the DFS traversal. For each airport on the stack, we keep visiting its next available destination until it has no outgoing edges.\\n  \\n3. **Build Itinerary**:  \\n   - During this process, we keep adding the current airport to the `itinerary` list.\\n  \\n4. **Reverse the Itinerary**:  \\n   - Finally, we reverse the `itinerary` list to get the final itinerary in correct order.\\n\\n### Time and Space Complexity\\n\\n- **Time Complexity**: $$O(N \\\\log N)$$, due to sorting.\\n- **Space Complexity**: $$O(N)$$, for storing the graph and the itinerary.\\n\\n\\n# Code Iterative\\n``` Python []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:\\n        graph = defaultdict(list)\\n        \\n        for src, dst in sorted(tickets, reverse=True):\\n            graph[src].append(dst)\\n        \\n        stack = [\"JFK\"]\\n        itinerary = []\\n        \\n        while stack:\\n            while graph[stack[-1]]:\\n                stack.append(graph[stack[-1]].pop())\\n            itinerary.append(stack.pop())\\n        \\n        return itinerary[::-1]\\n```\\n``` Go []\\nfunc findItinerary(tickets [][]string) []string {\\n\\tgraph := make(map[string][]string)\\n\\t\\n\\tfor _, ticket := range tickets {\\n\\t\\tgraph[ticket[0]] = append(graph[ticket[0]], ticket[1])\\n\\t}\\n\\t\\n\\tfor key := range graph {\\n\\t\\tsort.Sort(sort.Reverse(sort.StringSlice(graph[key])))\\n\\t}\\n\\t\\n\\tstack := []string{\"JFK\"}\\n\\tvar itinerary []string\\n\\t\\n\\tfor len(stack) > 0 {\\n\\t\\tfor len(graph[stack[len(stack)-1]]) > 0 {\\n\\t\\t\\tlast := len(graph[stack[len(stack)-1]]) -

They were first discussed by Leonhard Euler while solving the\\n famous Seven Bridges of K\\xF6nigsberg problem in 1736. The problem can be stated mathematically like this:\\n\\n Given the graph in the image, is it possible to construct a path (or a cycle, i.e. a path starting and ending on the same vertex) that visits each edge exactly once?\\n Euler proved that a necessary condition for the existence of Eulerian circuits is that all vertices in the graph have an even degree, and stated without proof that connected\\n graphs with all vertices of even degree have an Eulerian circuit.\\n This is known as Euler\\'s Theorem:\\n\\n**A connected graph has an Euler cycle iff every vertex has even degree**\\n \\n ```\\n A Graph must have nodes with even degree and odd degree. All the odd degree nodes are either start or end but all the even degree node will be only intermediate nodes.\\n But in case when all the nodes has even degree, then it contains the Eulerian Tour, as we we\\'ll start from some node and will end to this same node, as we need to consume all the edges.\\n```\\n\\n* Important:\\n If all nodes in graph has odd degree than its not possible to build Eulerian Path, as for coming and going from/to a node we require even degree for some of the node.\\n\\nWants learn more:\\n* Must Watch:\\nEulerian Path - Intro to Algorithms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycRuO-u6rt8\\nEulerian Path Solution - Intro to Algorithms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx1lpbpSHwI\\n\\nOk now lets do step by step ;\\nFrom: https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/discuss/78768/Short-Ruby-Python-Java-C%2B%2B\\nFirst keep going forward until you get stuck.

Yes ITS OUR PROBLEM!!\\uD83E\\uDD2F\\n\\nFor a **directed graph** to be a **Semi Euler Graph** it must meet some conditions:\\n- **In degree** for all nodes = **Out degree** for `all` nodes\\n- Except for two node: \\n    - `Starting` node should have `Out-degree = In degree + 1`\\n    - `Ending` node should have `In-degree = Out-degree + 1`\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s see some examples for our original problem.\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/f77a0035-03c5-4866-babf-5158a90eedd5_1694660526.9899151.png)\\n\\n\\nIn this example, we can see that `d` airport meets the condition for an ending node and `a` meets the condition for a starting node.\\nAn answer will be `(a, b, c, d)` \\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/672954c8-7a41-43ae-aeb1-ca8499802fc9_1694660033.5385113.png)\\n\\nIn this example, we can see that `b` airport meets the condition for an ending node and `a` meets the condition for a starting node.\\nAn answer will be also `(a, b, c, d, b)` \\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/09129f1c-1d18-468f-99e0-031b24d6e49e_1694659216.810375.png)\\nIn this example, we can see that the nodes didn\\'t meet the condition to be an **Semi Euler Graph**.\\nAnd if you tried to put it as a test case it will tell you `invalid input`.\\n\\nOkay, I think we have something here\\uD83E\\uDD2F \\nThe Pseudo Code for finding Euler Path is easy the only editing we will do it to sort the edges for the graph to be in the smallest lexical order.\\n\\nand for this problem, we will find for each test case that `JFK` meets the conditions to be a starting node.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s it the solution for our problem only a **Semi Euler Graph** \\uD83D\\uDE02\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n# Approach\\n## 1. DFS Recursive\\n### Steps\\n- Initialize a `flightGraph` as a `dictionary (map)` to represent flights and an itinerary list to store the final travel sequence.\\n- Iterate through each ticket and populate the `flightGraph` dictionary.\\n- Sort the destinations for each airport in reverse order to visit **lexical smaller** destinations first.\\n- Start the DFS traversal from the `JFK` airport.\\n- Using the **depth-first search** (DFS) method called `dfs` that takes an airport as input and recursively explores its destinations while **maintaining lexical order**. It adds the visited airports to the itinerary list.\\n- **Reverse** the itinerary list to get the correct travel order.\\n- **Return** the itinerary list as the final result.\\n\\n### Complexity\\n- **Time complexity:** $$O(N^2log(N))$$\\nSince we loop over lists of destinations in the flight graph and sorts them. Sorting each list has a time complexity of `O(E * log(E))`, where E is the total number of edges (tickets). Since `E` can be at most `N`, this step has a time complexity of `O(N * log(N))`. and since we loop over `N` city then the total time complexity is `O(N^2log(N))` where `N` is the number of airports.\\n- **Space complexity:** $$O(N+E)$$\\nWe are storing the Flight Graph which is represented using map of lists, which will have at most `N` keys (airports) and a total of `E` values (destinations). Therefore, the space complexity is `O(N + E)`.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. DFS Iterative\\n### Steps\\n- Initialize a `flightGraph` as a `dictionary (map)` to represent flights and an itinerary list to store the final travel sequence.\\n- Iterate through each ticket and populate the `flightGraph` dictionary.\\n- Sort the destinations for each airport in reverse order to visit **lexical smaller** destinations first.\\n- **Start** with `JFK` as the initial airport and create a stack.\\n- While the stack is `not empty`:\\n    - **Explore** destinations:\\n        - Push the next destination onto the stack.\\n    - **Backtrack**:\\n        - Add the current airport to the travel itinerary.\\n        - Pop the current airport from the stack.\\n- **Reverse** the travel itinerary to get the correct order.\\n- **Return** the travel itinerary as the final result.\\n\\n### Complexity\\n- **Time complexity:** $$O(N^2log(N))$$\\nSince we loop over lists of destinations in the flight graph and sorts them.

(say `m` in the code below. This map enables us to find all possible destinations from a place in amortized constant time.)\\n\\n- **Step 2**: Use a greedy and trace-back approach to find the optimal itinerary. Specifically, we use greedy method to find a lexicographically-smallest path until we can not move any further (the path can be stored in a vector, say `march` in the code below). Each time we reach such an exhaustive state, we find a place which is exactly the end of the itinerary. (The reason is, the path `march` is an optimal itinerary expect that some loops are omitted. The optimal itinerary can be obtained by inserting some loops into this path, which does not change the last vertex of the path.) Therefore, we can record the last vertex in another place (say `results` in the code below). So and so forth, the vector `results` stores the optimal itinerary reversely, since we always place the optimal last vertex at the end of this vector. Reversing the vertex `results` leads to the correct answer.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Example**:\\nThis example is originally shown in  StefanPochmann's thread [https://leetcode.com/discuss/84659/short-ruby-python-java-c][2]\\n\\n\\n![][3]  \\n[ Source of this picture: http://www.stefan-pochmann.info/misc/reconstruct-itinerary.png[][4] ]\\n\\n\\nIn Step 2, we first march greedily, and get the vector `march` as:\\n\\n    march: JFK -> A -> C -> D -> A      (the red path)\\n\\nHowever, the optimal itinerary, is \\n\\n    JFK -> A -> C -> D( -> B -> C -> JFK -> D) -> A\\n\\nwhere the loop (D -> B -> C -> JFK -> D) shall be inserted in the vector `march`. However, we have already found the last vertex A, Therefore, we can record this result. So `march` and `results` become\\n\\n    march: JFK -> A -> C -> D\\n    results: A\\n\\nThen we march greedily again, results in\\n\\n    march: JFK -> A -> C -> D -> B -> C -> JFK -> D\\n    results: A\\n\\nNow all edges are used. Before the final reversion, `march` and `results` become\\n\\n    march: (empty)\\n    results: A <- D <- JFK <- C <- B <- D <- C <- A <- JFK\\n\\n\\n----\\n\\n**Overall Complexities**:\\n\\nLet N be the number of tickets. Let D be the largest outgoing degree of a vertex.\\n\\n- **Time**: *O*(N log D)  \\nStep 1: O(N log D)  \\nStep 2: O(N). Each vertex needs to be put into `march` once and be moved from `march` to `results`. At the very end, `results` is reversed.\\n- **Space**: *O*(N)            \\nThe map `m` needs to store all vertices.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Code** (40 ms):\\n\\n    class Solution {\\n    public:\\n        vector<string> findItinerary(vector<pair<string, string>> tickets) {\\n            \\n            // Step 1: Store directed edges in a hash map\\n            unordered_map<string, multiset<string>> m;\\n            for (const pair<string, string> & ticket : tickets) {\\n                m[ticket.first].insert(ticket.second);\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Step 2: March greedily and traceback\\n            vector<string> march = { \"JFK\" }; // the storage for greedy searching\\n            vector<string> results; // store the final results reversely\\n            while (march.empty() == false) {\\n                string & from = march.back();\\n                if ((m.find(from) != m.end()) && (m[from].empty() == false)) { // march further\\n                    multiset<string> & to = m[from];\\n                    march.push_back(*(to.begin()));\\n                    to.erase(to.begin());\\n                } else { // can not march further, trace back\\n                    results.push_back(march.back()); // archive the last place\\n                    march.pop_back();\\n                }\\n            }\\n            reverse(results.begin(), results.end()); // reverse the entries back\\n            return results;\\n        }\\n    };\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://leetcode.com/discuss/84706/share-solution-java-greedy-stack-15ms-with-explanation\\n  [2]: https://leetcode.com/discuss/84659/short-ruby-python-java-c\\n  [3]: http://www.stefan-pochmann.info/misc/reconstruct-itinerary.png\\n  [4]: https://leetcode.com/discuss/84659/short-ruby-python-java-c",

Creating the Graph and Organizing Ticket Information:\\n   - Create a dictionary-style graph to store airports and their destinations.\\n   - Sort the ticket information in reverse order based on arrival airports.\\n\\n2. Initializing the Stack and New Itinerary:\\n   - Create a stack initialized with `JFK` as the departure airport.\\n   - Initialize a list to store the new itinerary.\\n\\n3. Constructing the Itinerary Using the Stack:\\n   - Repeat the following process as long as the stack is not empty:\\n   - Add potential destinations departing from the current airport to the stack.\\n   - When there are no more destinations, add the current airport to the new itinerary.\\n\\n4. Reversing the Itinerary:\\n   - Reverse the new itinerary to obtain the correct order of the itinerary.\\n\\n5. Returning the Correct Order Itinerary:\\n   - Return the reversed itinerary as the final result.\\n\\n# How it works\\n\\n```\\nInput: tickets = [[\"JFK\",\"SFO\"],[\"JFK\",\"ATL\"],[\"SFO\",\"ATL\"],\\n[\"ATL\",\"JFK\"],[\"ATL\",\"SFO\"]]\\n```\\n\\n## **Step 1:** Graph Initialization\\n\\nIn this step, the graph is initialized. The graph is represented as a dictionary with departure points (airports) as keys and lists of arrival points (other airports) as values. In this initialization, no information has been added yet.\\n\\nIn this step, the provided airline ticket information is sorted in reverse order.\\n\\nAirline tickets sorted in reverse order for lexical order: `[[\\'SFO\\', \\'ATL\\'], [\\'JFK\\', \\'SFO\\'], [\\'JFK\\', \\'ATL\\'], [\\'ATL\\', \\'SFO\\'], [\\'ATL\\', \\'JFK\\']]`\\n\\nThe reason for performing reverse sorting (reverse order) in this code is to use a stack and find the \"lexicographically smallest route\" according to the constraints of the problem. There are two key points in the constraints:\\n\\n1. The departure point must be `JFK.`\\n2. The lexicographically smallest route needs to be found.\\n\\nBy performing reverse sorting, when the departure point is `JFK` the route will start with the ticket that has the smallest destination in lexicographical order. In other words, the route that starts from `JFK` is chosen as the smallest route initially.\\n\\nThe other important reason is that we can use `pop()` and easily get the smallest destination in lexicographical order with `O(1)`. Therefore, reverse sorting is necessary to meet the constraints of the problem.\\n\\n```\\ngraph = {\\n    \"SFO\": [\"ATL\"],\\n    \"JFK\": [\"SFO\", \"ATL\"],\\n    \"ATL\": [\"SFO\", \"JFK\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe graph has been correctly updated as a result of this step.\\n\\n## **Step 2:** Stack and Itinerary Initialization\\n\\nIn this step, the stack `st` and an empty itinerary list `new_itinerary` are initialized.\\n\\n```\\nst: [\"JFK\"]\\nnew_itinerary: []\\n```\\n\\n## **Step 3:** Building the Itinerary Using the Stack\\n\\nIn this step, the itinerary is constructed using a stack. The following operations are repeated in each step of stack operation.\\n\\n1. Check the current airport at the top of the stack. The initial airport is `JFK`.\\n\\n    - `st`: `[\"JFK\"]`\\n    - `new_itinerary`: `[]`\\n\\n2. Find the places reachable from the current airport `JFK`. From the current airport `JFK`, you can go to `SFO` and `ATL`. Add `ATL` to the stack.\\n\\n    - `st`: `[\"JFK\", \"ATL\"]`\\n    - `new_itinerary`: `[]`\\n\\nCurrent graph:\\n```\\ngraph = {\\n    \"SFO\": [\"ATL\"],\\n    \"JFK\": [\"SFO\"],\\n    \"ATL\": [\"SFO\", \"JFK\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n4. Add the places reachable from `ATL` to the stack. From the current airport `ATL`, you can go to `SFO` and `JFK`. Add `JFK` to the stack.\\n\\n    - `st`: `[\"JFK\", \"ATL\", \"JFK\"]`\\n    - `new_itinerary`: `[]`\\n\\nCurrent graph:\\n```\\ngraph = {\\n    \"SFO\": [\"ATL\"],\\n    \"JFK\": [\"SFO\"],\\n    \"ATL\": [\"SFO\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n5. Add the places reachable from `JFK` to the stack. From the current airport `JFK`, you can go to `SFO`. Add `JFK` to the stack.\\n\\n    - `st`: `[\"JFK\", \"ATL\", \"JFK\", \"SFO\"]`\\n    - `new_itinerary`: `[\"\"]`\\n\\nCurrent graph:\\n```\\ngraph = {\\n    \"SFO\": [\"ATL\"],\\n    \"JFK\": [\"\"],\\n    \"ATL\": [\"SFO\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n6. Add the places reachable from `SFO` to the stack. From the current airport `SFO`, you can go to `ATL`. Add ATL` to the stack.\\n\\n    - `st`: `[\"JFK\", \"ATL\", \"JFK\", \"SFO\", \"ATL\"]`\\n    - `new_itinerary`: `[\"\"]`\\n\\nCurrent graph:\\n```\\ngraph = {\\n    \"SFO\": [\"\"],\\n    \"JFK\": [\"\"],\\n    \"ATL\": [\"SFO\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n7. Add the places reachable from `ATL` to the stack. From the current airport `ATL`, you can go to `SFO`.

                "content": "The problem can be modelled as a graph, with each node representing a city, and each ticket representing an edge from source city to destination city. The problem asks us to find a connected sequence(path) consisting of all edges in a graph, starting with \"JFK\".\\n\\nOur general intuition is to jump to algorithms like DFS/BFS. The DFS/BFS algorithms help us traverse all nodes in the graph, but fail to cover all edges in the graph, so we need to look for something more special.\\n\\nThis is where Eulerian Path comes into play. An Eulerian Path is a list of all edges in a graph in a sequence such that you can go from point A to all other nodes in the graph multiple times, as long as an edge is not visited. This should solve our problem.\\n\\nEulerian Path can be implemented using a slightly modified version of DFS. A normal DFS algorithm would look like this:\\n\\n```\\n// Normal DFS Pseudo Code\\n\\nDFS(node)\\n{\\n\\tif (visited[node])\\n\\t\\treturn;\\n\\tvisited[node]=true;\\n\\tfor (neighbour : graph[node]) {\\n\\t\\tDFS(neighbour);\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\nNote that here, we only check if a node is visited, which does not guarantee if all paths going to the node have been visited or not. One way to track if all edges have been visited to a node, is to track the outdegree of the node and continuously decrementing the outdegree until it becomes 0. So our modified DFS becomes:\\n\\n```\\nModifiedDFS(node)\\n{\\n\\tif (outdegree[node] == 0) // no more outgoing edges to visit\\n\\t\\treturn;\\n\\t\\t--outdegree[node]       // next neighbour will be visited, reduce outdegree\\n\\tfor (next_unvisited_neighbour : graph[node])\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tModifiedDFS(next_unvisited_neighbour);\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn addition to this, we would also like to make sure that while returning, we capture the node that we have completed visiting while returing back. We could either reverse the order at the end of capturing all nodes we visited to get our path, or we could just use list and record our nodes from back to front.

Create an adjacency list representation of the flights. Use an unordered_map where the key is the source airport, and the value is a multiset (sorted set) of destination airports. This allows multiple tickets to have the same source airport.\\n\\n1. Initialize an empty vector called `result` to store the final itinerary.\\n\\n1. Start the DFS traversal from the \"JFK\" airport. The goal is to visit all airports in a way that respects the lexicographically smallest order.\\n\\n1. In the DFS function:\\n\\n   - While there are destinations connected to the current airport:\\n   - Get the next destination by picking the smallest destination lexicographically (because it\\'s stored in a multiset).\\n   - Remove this destination from the list to ensure it\\'s not visited again.\\n   - Recursively explore this destination.\\n 1. After finishing the DFS traversal, reverse the `result` vector. This is necessary because the DFS builds the itinerary in reverse order.\\n\\n1.

                "content": "# Approach\\nThe approach used in this code is to find an itinerary that visits all of the destination airports in a given list of tickets using a depth-first search algorithm.\\nThe intuition behind using a depth-first search to find an itinerary is that it is a relatively simple way to explore all of the possible itineraries and return the one that visits all of the destination airports. By sorting the destination airports in lexicographic order and always choosing the destination that comes first in that order, the algorithm is able to find a valid itinerary that is lexicographically smallest.\\n# Complexity\\nThe complexity of this code depends on the size of the input, which is the list of tickets.\\n\\nThe time complexity of the findItinerary method is O(n log n) because it iterates over the list of tickets once to construct the map variable, and it sorts each list of destinations in the map using the Collections.sort method, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).\\n\\nThe time complexity of the findItenaryDFS method is O(n) because it performs a constant amount of work for each destination airport in the destination list.\\n\\nThe space complexity of both methods is O(n) because they both use a hash map and a linked list to store the input data and the result, and the size of these data structures is directly proportional to the size of the input.\\n\\n# why I have used a linked list:\\n LinkedList is used to store the lists of destination airports for each starting airport in the HashMap.The LinkedList was chosen because it allows elements to be added or removed from the beginning or end of the list in constant time. This is useful in the findItenaryDFS method, where we need to efficiently remove the first destination airport from the list and perform a depth-first search starting at that airport.\\nThe LinkedList data structure is also used to store the final itinerary,This allows the final itinerary to be constructed in the correct order without the need to reverse the list at the end.\\n\\n# how do we know that the airport is only visited once:\\nIn this implementation, each destination airport is visited only once because it is removed from the list of destinations for its starting airport as soon as it is visited. This is done using the pollFirst method, which removes and returns the first element of the list.\\nFor example, when the DFS reaches \"SFO\" as the starting airport, it removes \"ATL\" from the list of destinations for \"SFO\" using pollFirst. This ensures that \"ATL\" is not visited again from \"SFO\" during the DFS.\\nThis approach ensures that each airport is visited only once because the DFS will not revisit an airport if it is not present in the list of destinations for any starting airport.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    // map: keys are starting airports and values are lists of destination airports\\n    HashMap<String, LinkedList<String>> map;\\n    // list of airports visited in order\\n    LinkedList<String> result;\\n    // given a list of tickets, returns the itinerary in the form of a list of airports visited\\n    public List<String> findItinerary(List<List<String>> tickets) {\\n        result = new LinkedList<>();\\n        map = new HashMap<>();\\n         // for each ticket, add the destination to the list of destinations for the ticket\\'s starting airport\\n        for (List<String> t : tickets) {\\n            String src = t.get(0);\\n            map.putIfAbsent(src, new LinkedList<>());\\n            map.get(src).add(t.get(1));\\n        }\\n        // sort the lists of destinations so they are in lexicographic order\\n        map.forEach((key, value) -> Collections.sort(value));\\n        // start at JFK and find the itinerary using depth-first search\\n        findItenaryDFS(\"JFK\");\\n        return result;\\n    }\\n    // finds the itinerary starting at the given airport using depth-first search\\n    public void findItenaryDFS(String start){\\n        if (map.containsKey(start)){\\n            LinkedList<String> destination = map.get(start);\\n            // for each destination, find the itinerary starting at that destination\\n            while (!destination.isEmpty()) {\\n                String des = destination.pollFirst();\\n                findItenaryDFS(des);\\n            }\\n        }\\n    // once there are no more destinations, add the current airport to the front of the result list\\n        result.offerFirst(start);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n// findItinerary(tickets)\\n\\n// 1.

Start with an empty stack and an empty circuit (eulerian path).\\n   - If all vertices have same out-degrees as in-degrees - choose any of them.\\n   - If all but 2 vertices have same out-degree as in-degree, and one of those 2 vertices has out-degree with one greater than its in-degree, and the other has in-degree with one greater than its out-degree - then choose the vertex that has its out-degree with one greater than its in-degree.\\n   - Otherwise no euler circuit or path exists.\\n\\n2. If current vertex has no out-going edges (i.e. neighbors) - add it to circuit, remove the last vertex from the stack and set it as the current one. Otherwise (in case it has out-going edges, i.e. neighbors) - add the vertex to the stack, take any of its neighbors, remove the edge between that vertex and selected neighbor, and set that neighbor as the current vertex.\\n\\n3. Repeat step 2 until the current vertex has no more out-going edges (neighbors) and the stack is empty.\\nNote that obtained circuit will be in reverse order - from end vertex to start vertex.\\n\\nCode:\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public List<String> findItinerary(String[][] tickets) {\\n        Map<String, PriorityQueue<String>> map = new HashMap<>();\\n        LinkedList<String> route = new LinkedList<>();\\n        Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();\\n        \\n        for (String[] t : tickets) {\\n            map.putIfAbsent(t[0], new PriorityQueue<>());\\n            map.putIfAbsent(t[1], new PriorityQueue<>()); //construct a queue for every node (even those without neighbors)\\n            map.get(t[0]).add(t[1]);\\n        }\\n        \\n        String cur = \"JFK\";\\n        while (map.get(cur).size() != 0 || !stack.isEmpty()){\\n            if (map.get(cur).size() == 0){\\n                route.add(cur);\\n                cur = stack.pop();\\n            } else {\\n                stack.add(cur);\\n                cur = map.get(cur).poll();\\n            }\\n        }\\n        route.add(cur);\\n        Collections.reverse(route);\\n        return route;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

                "content": "**Idea**\\n\\nThe idea behind this solution is based on Hierholzer\\'s algorithm (Link below). Learning how the algorithm works is left as an exercise to the reader. (It is very intuitive). \\n\\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hierholzers-algorithm-directed-graph/\\n\\nThe algorithm is designed to find an eulerian path, assuming the graph is eulerian. An eulerian path is basically a path that starts on some node and traverses across all the edges exactly once. It requires that the graph is eulerian, which for a directed graph implies that each node has an equal number of ins and outs, or exactly two nodes has an odd degree. \\n\\nThis is very similar to what we need for this problem, which is to find a way to visit all the locations. If we look at the problem, each airport must be either a transitional stop, the start, or the final destination. This corresponds to an eulerian graph with exactly two nodes with an odd degree. We must start from the starting airport, so the start cannot be even (there must be more edges leaving than entering), and we must end at the destination (must be more edges ending than leaving). All other airports must have an even degree, because we cannot stay there (must leave the same number of times we enter). Thus, this problem can be directly reduced to finding an eulerian path from the graph made from the vector of edges.\\n\\nHowever, we are given the condition that for solutions with multiple possible paths, we need to pick the one that puts the lowest by alphabetical name airports first. Thus, we need to modify the algorithm so that when it selects an edge, it selects the edge with the lowest alphabetical name first. \\n\\n**Implementation**\\n\\nThe first thing is the representation of the graph. I opted for an unordered_map because the graph is sparse. Each unordered_map uses a priority queue to keep track of the edges and returns the lowest alphabetical edge. \\n\\nFor the implementation of the algorithm, I opted to insert the elements into the current list by reverse, because if they were inserted normally I would have to start moving and deleting by reverse, and I was not able to find a good method to do that. Inserting in reverse allows me to delete and move using normal iterators, which can be done using normal erase operation.\\n\\n\\n**Runtime**\\n\\nThe run time of this algorithm is the same as that for Hierholzer\\'s algorithm, which is O(E), where E is the number of edges. In this case that would be linear to the input edge vector.\\n\\n\\n```\\nstruct cmp {\\n\\t  bool operator()(const string &lhs, const string &rhs) {\\n\\t\\treturn lhs > rhs;\\n\\t}\\n};\\n\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    static void dfs(unordered_map<string, priority_queue<string, vector<string>, cmp>>& edges, string start, list<string>& cur) {\\n        auto it = edges.find(start);\\n        while(it != edges.end()) {\\n            string next = it->second.top(); it->second.pop();\\n            if(it->second.empty()) edges.erase(it);\\n            cur.push_front(next);\\n            it = edges.find(next);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    const vector<string> findItinerary(vector<pair<string, string>> tickets) {\\n\\t\\n        unordered_map<string, priority_queue<string, vector<string>, cmp>> edges;\\n        for(auto &edge: tickets) edges[edge.first].push(edge.second);\\n        if(edges.empty()) return {};\\n\\n        list<string> cur{\"JFK\"}, overall;\\n        string next = \"JFK\";\\n        while(!cur.empty()) {\\n            dfs(edges, next, cur);\\n            auto it = cur.begin();\\n            while(it != cur.end() && edges.find(*it) == edges.end()) {\\n                overall.push_front(*it);\\n                cur.erase(it++);\\n            }\\n            if(!cur.empty()) next = *it;\\n        }\\n        return vector<string>(overall.begin(), overall.end());\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "**CONCEPT:** The idea here is to use DFS and Eulerian Paths concept to solve the problem. Why? Because in the question, we\\'re basically asked to visit all the nodes in a graph only once even when there\\'s a cycle in the graph.\\n\\nSo the question boils down to visiting each node once (printing them) and all nodes must be visited.\\n\\n**OBSERVATIONS:** Here, we\\'re asked to generate a path such that we only traverse in lexical order (remember that priority_queue and set can be used for this, they store things in sorted order) and no edge should be traversed more than once (just like the condition for semi-eulerian paths).\\n\\nBut now you\\'ll ask, how can we not traverse an edge more than once? Aren\\'t we having an undirected graph? And you\\'ll be right but remember, an undirected graph is just a directed graph with an edge from source to target and target to source.\\n\\nSo, it\\'s obvious that we\\'re going to start from the node called \"JFK\" (as asked in the question). Then we\\'re going to choose a node that is a neighbor of/adjacent to the node \"JFK\". We\\'re treating airports as nodes here. When we choose a neighbor of JFK, we\\'ll choose the one that\\'s on top in lexical ordering. Then we\\'ll go to that node and find the top lexical ordering neighbor of that node. So all we\\'re doing is hopping from one node to its neighbor and then to that neighbor\\'s neighbor and so on.\\n\\n**SOLUTION:** We can use simple iterative DFS for this. In DFS, we pick a node, take its neighbor, then go there, then find that neighbor\\'s neighbor and go there and just like that, we\\'ll have a solved problem.\\n\\nSo first, we know that we don\\'t have integers as nodes here, we have strings. So we cannot really use a vector to identify nodes with an index. So we can use a map, specifically unordered_map since we don\\'t need to sort these nodes (only their neighbors). So the map will take a node (string) and have a multiset ready for it as its neighbors (multiset because there can be duplicate nodes).\\n\\nNow we\\'ll fill the neighbors according to what we\\'re given. Loop through all the tickets and extract the source and target node first, then set the target node as a neighbor of source node in the map.\\n\\nNext, ready an empty stack. This stack is used for iterative DFS, we\\'re following the standard process of DFS algorithm. Now we know we have to start with the node \"JFK\" so we push it into the stack (starting point of DFS). Also create an ans vector, we\\'ll return this as our answer.\\n\\nStart the DFS, while stack is not empty, run a loop.\\nTake the top of the stack, this is our current node.\\nNow, if current node has no neighbors, meaning that the map value (multiset) of current node has size equal to 0, we will stop the DFS by pushing the current node into the ans and popping the stack\\'s top.\\n\\nIf current node has neighbors, we\\'ll first select the top neighbor that\\'s supposedly already in the lexical order, and push it into the stack (meaning that we\\'ll visit it next). Since we\\'re visiting this neighbor, eulerian path requires us to never visit this edge again, so we\\'ll remove neighbor from current node\\'s neighbors list.\\n\\nDuring this process, we\\'ll be picking a node, traverse its first neighbor (top of lexical ordering), delete this edge (remove this neighbor from neighbors list) and repeat these 3 steps until we arrive at a node that has no more neighbors. Once we find a node with no neighbors, we add this node in our answer vector and return to its parent, if the parent again has no more neighbors, we add the parent in our answer vector and this process goes on and on till no more nodes are left in the DFS stack.\\n\\nDuring this process, note that whatever path we were taking, we were pushing the last node before its parent, which means our answer vector will contain the correct path but in reverse order. This is a thing to remember about DFS, we traverse the nodes in reverse order when returning.\\n\\nSo, that\\'s all, just reverse the answer vector and return it.

As a result of the shoddy explanation, this one had me going around in circles until I finally checked some of the solutions. Pointless frustration, as it turns out, as the missing information made the problem requirements seem a lot more difficult than they actually are. And the \"accepted\" solution (taken after others posted) gives nonsensical answers in a number of cases.\\n\\nFor example, if I set up a graph that looks like this:\\n```\\nJFK->[SFO, DUB]\\n```\\nthe solution my \"correct\" answer gives me is ` JFK SFO DUB.` Which is actually impossible. In a production environment, an impossible state should give null or an error. The instructions neglect to mention any error state. \\n\\nHere\\'s another:\\n```\\nDUB->[SFO] JFK->[SFO, DUB] SFO->[DUB]\\n```\\nThe order called for by the instructions (i.e. the lexically smallest) would be `JFK DUB SFO DUB` (with one leg impossible to reach). What it actually gives is `JFK SFO DUB SFO DUB` which is incorrect because it\\'s not lexically the smallest, and it lists the trip from SFO to DUB that doesn\\'t exist in the tickets. \\n\\nSo apparently there is some kind of guarantee that the data has an unspecified shape that\\'s key to solving the problem, but you\\'re going to make us just guess? That\\'s not a very worthwhile game. Edge cases should be important, but the way this problem is written, it ignores all of them. A good programmer should worry about them, but that makes the problem ridiculously difficult, because the real requirements were not clearly stated. \\n\\nThere are a lot of well-written problems on Leetcode. This is not one of them. \\n\\n```java\\n    void dfs(Map<String, List<String>> graph, List<String> rs, String here) {\\n        List<String> adj=graph.computeIfAbsent(here, e-> new ArrayList<>() );\\n        while (!adj.isEmpty())\\n            dfs(graph, rs, adj.remove(adj.size()-1));\\n        rs.add(here);\\n    }\\n\\n    public List<String> findItinerary(List<List<String>> tix) {\\n        tix.sort(Comparator\\n            .comparing((List<String> a) -> (a.get(0) + a.get(1)))\\n            .reversed());\\n        Map<String, List<String>> graph = new HashMap<>();\\n        tix.forEach( t -> graph\\n            .computeIfAbsent(t.get(0), (e -> new ArrayList<>()))\\n            .add(t.get(1)) );\\n\\n        List<String> rs=new ArrayList<>();\\n        dfs(graph, rs, \"JFK\");\\n        Collections.reverse(rs);\\n        return rs;\\n    }\\n\\n```",

The goal is to find a valid itinerary that visits all the airports exactly once and returns it in lexical order.\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe approach used in the code is **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to explore possible routes. The flight function builds a graph representation of the tickets, and the dfs function performs the **DFS traversal starting from the \"JFK\" airport**. During the traversal, it keeps picking the **smallest lexical airport (due to the use of a priority queue)** from the available options and continues exploring until there are no more options. This ensures that the final ans vector will contain a **valid itinerary in lexical order**.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n1. Constructing the graph (in the flight function) takes **O(n)**, where n is the number of flight tickets.\\n1. The **DFS traversal** (in the dfs function) explores each airport at most once, so it takes **O(n)** time as well.\\n1. Reversing the ans vector takes **O(n)**.\\n1. Overall, the time complexity of the code is **O(n)**.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n1. The code uses an **unordered map f** to store the graph representation, which can take up to **O(n)** space since there can be a ticket for each unique airport.\\n1. The **priority queue** for each airport can have a maximum of n entries (in the worst case), so the space complexity of the priority queues is also **O(n)**.\\n1. The **ans vector** can also take up to **O(n)** space.\\n1. Overall, the space complexity of the code is **O(n)**.\\n\\n**In summary, the code efficiently finds a valid itinerary in lexical order using a graph representation and DFS traversal. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).**\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    unordered_map<string,priority_queue<string,vector<string>,greater<string>>>f;\\n    vector<string>ans;\\n\\n    void dfs(string dept){\\n        while(!f[dept].empty()){\\n            string to=f[dept].top();\\n            f[dept].pop();\\n            dfs(to);\\n        }\\n        ans.push_back(dept);\\n    }\\n\\n    void flight(vector<vector<string>> &tickets){\\n        for(auto &it: tickets){\\n            string from=it[0];\\n            string to=it[1];\\n            f[from].push(to);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {\\n        flight(tickets);\\n        dfs(\"JFK\");\\n        reverse(ans.begin(),ans.end());\\n\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Then, starting from the initial airport JFK, the code performs a depth-first search (DFS) to visit all the airports in the itinerary in a lexicographically sorted order, i.e., if there are multiple destinations available from an airport, then the code picks the one that comes first in alphabetical order. The itinerary is stored in the res array, which is then reversed and returned as the final answer.\\n\\n# Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n- The first for-loop runs through all the tickets once, therefore takes `O(n)` time where n is the number of tickets.\\n- The second for-loop iterates through each airport in the map and sorts the destinations. The time complexity of the sorting operation is `O(m log m)` where m is the number of destinations for an airport. Since the total number of destinations across all airports is equal to n-1 (where n is the total number of tickets), the time complexity of this loop is `O(n log n)`.\\n- The DFS function is called once for each airport in the map, which takes `O(m)` time where m is the number of destinations for an airport. Since the total number of destinations across all airports is equal to n-1, the time complexity of this function is `O(n)`.\\n- Finally, reversing the res array takes `O(n)` time.\\n\\n\\nTherefore, the overall time complexity of the code is **`O(n log n)`**, where n is the number of tickets.\\n\\n# Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n- The space complexity of the code is dominated by the map object, which stores the destinations for each airport. Since there are n distinct airports, the space complexity of the map is `O(n).`\\n- The DFS function uses a recursive call stack, which can have a depth of up to n, therefore the space complexity of the DFS function is `O(n)`.\\n- The res array stores the itinerary, which can have a maximum size of n+1, therefore the space complexity of the res array is also `O(n)`.\\n- The rest of the variables used in the code have constant space complexity.\\n\\nTherefore, the overall space complexity of the code is `O(n)`.\\n\\n# JavaScript Code\\n```\\n/**\\n * @param {string[][]} tickets\\n * @return {string[]}\\n */\\nvar findItinerary = function(tickets) {\\n    var map = {};\\n    var res = [];\\n    for(var i=0; i<tickets.length; i++) {\\n        var dep = tickets[i][0];\\n        var des = tickets[i][1];\\n        if(map[dep]) {\\n            map[dep].push(des);\\n        } else {\\n            map[dep] = [des];\\n        }\\n    }\\n    for(let loc in map) {\\n        map[loc].sort();\\n    }  \\n    var dfs = function(node) {\\n        var des = map[node];\\n        while(des && des.length>0) {\\n            dfs(des.shift());\\n        }\\n        res.push(node);\\n    }\\n    dfs(\\'JFK\\');\\n    return res.reverse();\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\\n> # My Section\\n```\\nThanks For Reading This Solution . \\n\\nNow You Can Solve This Problem .\\n \\nHope You Will Give A Up-Vote To My Solution .\\n```",

We should start from the starting node \"JFK\" and keep moving deep into the graph until we encounter a **DEAD END**\\nBy DEAD END we mean a node which either has no edges directing out from it ( *outDegree = 0* ) or it has no edges directing out from it which havent been included in the path already.\\nIn both the case, this very node would be our last node in the itinerary and thus we would push it in the stack. \\nFollowing the recursive approach, we do this for the entire path from that node onwards. \\nFinally we reverse the stack and output the path.\\n\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {\\n        // build graph (mapping each string node to an interger)\\n        unordered_map<string,int> umap; //mapping: string node -> int node\\n        vector<string> mapping; // stores all the nodes as strings\\n        for(int i = 0; i<tickets.size(); i++){\\n            if(umap.find(tickets[i][0])==umap.end()){// using umap to check if the node has been added already\\n                umap[tickets[i][0]]=1;\\n                mapping.push_back(tickets[i][0]);\\n            }\\n            if(umap.find(tickets[i][1])==umap.end()){// using umap to check if the node has been added already\\n                umap[tickets[i][1]]=1;\\n                mapping.push_back(tickets[i][1]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        // now mapping stores all the DISTINCT nodes as strings\\n        sort(mapping.begin(), mapping.end()); // sorting the nodes lexographically\\n        int n = mapping.size(); // n = number of nodes\\n        unordered_map<int,string> umap1; // mapping: int node -> string node\\n        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){ //generating the map\\n            umap[mapping[i]]=i;\\n            umap1[i]=mapping[i];\\n        }\\n        int startNode = umap[\"JFK\"];// declaring the starting node (mapping it from string to int)\\n        vector<pair<int,int> > adj[n]; // pair<int, int> = pair<next node, visited/notvisited (1/0)>\\n        // building the graph\\n        for(int i = 0; i<tickets.size(); i++){\\n            int u = umap[tickets[i][0]];\\n            int v = umap[tickets[i][1]];\\n            adj[u].push_back(make_pair(v,1));\\n        }\\n        // sorting all adjacent nodes lexographically\\n        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){\\n            sort(adj[i].begin(),adj[i].end());\\n        }\\n        stack<int> ans; // to store the path\\n        dfs(startNode,adj,ans);\\n        vector<string> an;\\n        while(!ans.empty()){\\n            an.push_back(umap1[ans.top()]);\\n            ans.pop();\\n        }\\n        return an;\\n    }\\nprivate:\\n    void dfs(int node, vector<pair<int,int> > adj[], stack<int> &ans){\\n        for(int i = 0; i<adj[node].size(); i++){\\n            if(adj[node][i].second){\\n                adj[node][i].second=0; //marking the edge visited\\n                dfs(adj[node][i].first,adj,ans);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        ans.push(node);\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "The question is simple to understand. We just need to form an itinerary which will contain the names of airports which the person will visit in the same order. Our job is to find the order in which the person will visit the airport.\\n\\nWe will first create the adjacency list which will contain the information about the source and destination airports. One source airport may have multiple destinations in `tickets`; for example `[[\"JFK\",\"SFO\"],[\"JFK\",\"ATL\"],[\"ATL\", \"JFK\"]]`. We have to print the lexicographically smallest order. That is, our output for the above example should be `[\"JFK\", \"ATL\", \"JFK\", \"SFO\"]`. We can create a map of vector and sort for each key in the map.\\n\\nHowever, we can ease our pain by using a map of min heap instead. It will give us the lexicographically smallest airport. \\n\\nAfter reaching one destination, we have to reach the next destination according to our ticket, so it is better to use DFS instead of BFS. \\n\\nFor each visited node (airport), pop it from the priority_queue and perform dfs on the popped node.

Since there always a way to have all tickets, so at point x, there wil be one or more circles. \\n\\n`\\n\\n    var findItinerary = function(tickets) {\\n        if (tickets == null || tickets.length == 0) return [];\\n        var map = {};\\n        var result = [];\\n        \\n        tickets.sort(sortArray);\\n        for(var i = 0; i < tickets.length; i++) {\\n            if(tickets[i][0] in map) map[tickets[i][0]].push(tickets[i][1]);\\n            else map[tickets[i][0]] = [tickets[i][1]];\\n        }\\n        \\n        var key = 'JFK';\\n        var drawback = [];\\n        for(var i = 0; i < tickets.length; i++) {\\n            while(!(key in map) || map[key].length == 0) {\\n                drawback.push(key);\\n                key = result.pop();\\n            }\\n            result.push(key);\\n            key = map[key].shift();\\n        }\\n        result.push(key);\\n        while(drawback.length > 0) result.push(drawback.pop());\\n    \\n        return result;\\n        \\n                        \\n    };\\n    \\n    function sortArray(a,b) {\\n        if(a[0] == b[0]) return (a[1] < b[1] ? -1: (a[1] > b[1] ? 1: 0));\\n    \\n        return (a[0] < b[0] ? -1 : 1);\\n    }\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://leetcode.com/discuss/84706/share-solution-java-greedy-stack-15ms-with-explanation",

This approach guarantees the lexicographically smallest itinerary, which is the key requirement of the problem.\\n# Upvote if it helps \\uD83D\\uDE0A\\n1. **LexiSmallerComparator**: This is a custom comparator class that implements the `Comparator` interface. It is used to compare two strings (`s1` and `s2`) lexicographically.

It takes three parameters: `graph` (a map representing the directed graph of airports), `curr` (the current airport being visited), and `ans` (a list to store the itinerary).\\n\\n   - Inside the method, it checks if the `graph` contains the current airport (`curr`) and if its priority queue (representing destinations) is not empty.\\n   - If the conditions are met, it dequeues the next airport `next` from the priority queue of the current airport.\\n   - Then, it recursively calls `dfs` with the `next` airport as the current one.\\n   - This process continues until there are no more destinations from the current airport.\\n   - Finally, the current airport `curr` is added to the `ans` list, effectively reversing the order of the itinerary (as it\\'s added in a depth-first manner).\\n\\n3. **findItinerary Method**: \\n   - It starts by initializing an empty `graph`, which is a map where each **airport is a key, and the value is a priority queue of destinations (sorted lexicographically)**.\\n   - It then iterates through the `tickets` list, extracting the \"from\" and \"to\" airports from each ticket.\\n   - For each ticket, it checks if the `from` airport is already in the `graph`. If not, it adds an entry with an empty priority queue.\\n   - It then adds the \"to\" airport to the priority queue of the \"from\" airport, ensuring that destinations are sorted lexicographically.\\n   - Next, it initializes an empty `ans` list to store the itinerary.\\n   - It starts the DFS traversal by calling `dfs` with \"JFK\" (the starting airport) as the current airport.\\n   - After the DFS traversal is complete, the `ans` list contains the itinerary in reverse order (due to the depth-first traversal).\\n   - To obtain the correct order, it reverses the `ans` list using `Collections.reverse`.\\n\\n4. Finally, it returns the lexicographically smallest itinerary as a list of strings.\\n\\n# DFS Handles dead-end cases \\nDepth-First Search (DFS) handles dead-end cases by backtracking to the previous valid choice when there are no more unvisited options from the current state. This is achieved through recursion, and in the context of finding an itinerary with the given problem, it means that if there\\'s a dead-end at an airport, the DFS will backtrack to the previous airport where there are unvisited destinations and continue the exploration from there.\\n\\nLet\\'s illustrate this with the provided `tickets` example: ` [[\"JFK\",\"KUL\"],[\"JFK\",\"NRT\"],[\"NRT\",\"JFK\"]]`.\\n\\n1. The DFS starts from \"JFK,\" which is the initial airport.\\n2. From \"JFK,\" there are two options: \"KUL\" and \"NRT.\"\\n   - It chooses \"KUL\" because it\\'s lexicographically smaller and marks it as visited.\\n   - The DFS continues from \"KUL,\" but there are no more unvisited destinations from \"KUL.\"\\n   - At this point, it backtracks to the previous airport, which is \"JFK,\" and checks if there are other unvisited destinations.\\n3. From \"JFK,\" there is still an unvisited option, \"NRT.\"\\n   - It chooses \"NRT\" because it\\'s the only remaining option and marks it as visited.\\n   - The DFS continues from \"NRT,\" but again, there are no more unvisited destinations from \"NRT.\"\\n   - It backtracks to \"JFK\" once more.\\n4. Now, from \"JFK,\" there are no more unvisited destinations.\\n   - It backtracks again, but this time, there\\'s no previous airport to backtrack to because \"JFK\" is the starting point.\\n   - At this point, the DFS traversal ends.\\n\\nThe key point to understand is that when a dead-end is encountered (i.e., no more unvisited destinations from the current airport), the DFS algorithm automatically backtracks to the previous airport where there are unvisited destinations. It keeps doing this until it reaches an airport with unvisited destinations or returns to the starting airport. In this way, it explores all possible routes through the airports to find the lexicographically smallest itinerary.\\n\\nIn the example provided, the algorithm explores all available routes and returns the itinerary: `[\"JFK\", \"NRT\", \"JFK\", \"KUL\"]`, which is the lexicographically smallest valid itinerary for the given tickets.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(N * log N)\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(N * log N)\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public List<String> findItinerary(List<List<String>> tickets) {\\n\\n        //directed graph mapping \"from\" airport to all its \"to\" airport according to tickets\\n        Map<String, PriorityQueue<String>> graph = new HashMap<>();\\n        for(List<String>t :tickets){\\n            String from = t.get(0), to = t.get(1);\\n            if(!graph.containsKey(from)){\\n                graph.put(from, new PriorityQueue<>(new LexiSmallerComparator()));\\n            }\\n            graph.get(from).add(to);\\n        }\\n\\n        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();\\n        dfs(graph, \"JFK\", ans);//depart from JFK\\n        \\n        //reverse to get correct order\\n        Collections.reverse(ans);\\n\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n\\n\\n    // Custom comparator for lexicographically smaller strings\\n    static class LexiSmallerComparator implements Comparator<String> {\\n        @Override\\n        public int compare(String s1, String s2) {\\n            return s1.compareTo(s2); // Use the natural ordering of strings\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Helper method for DFS traversal\\n    private void dfs(Map<String, PriorityQueue<String>> graph, String curr, List<String> ans) {\\n        while (graph.containsKey(curr) && !graph.get(curr).isEmpty()) {\\n            String next = graph.get(curr).poll();\\n            dfs(graph, next, ans);\\n        }\\n        ans.add(curr);\\n    }\\n\\n}\\n```",

Create a graph using the given tickets, where each airport is represented as a node, and the flights between airports are represented as edges.\\n\\n 2. Sort the destinations (arrival airports) in lexicographic order for each departure airport. This ensures that we visit the smaller destination\\n first in case of multiple flights from the same departure airport.\\n\\n 3. Initialize an empty stack and push the starting airport, \"JFK\", onto the stack.\\n\\n 4. While the stack is not empty, do the following:\\n - Peek the top airport from the stack.\\n - If the airport has any remaining destinations, select the smallest lexicographic destination and push it onto the stack.\\n - If the airport has no remaining destinations, pop the airport from the stack and add it to the itinerary list.\\n\\n 5. Reverse the itinerary list to get the correct order of airports visited.\\n\\n 6. Return the itinerary list.\\n\\n For the given example:\\n\\n Input: tickets = [[\"MUC\",\"LHR\"],[\"JFK\",\"MUC\"],[\"SFO\",\"SJC\"],[\"LHR\",\"SFO\"]]\\n\\n The itinerary using Eulerian Circuit will be:\\n\\n 1. Create a graph: JFK -> MUC -> LHR -> SFO -> SJC\\n 2. Sort destinations: JFK -> MUC -> LHR -> SFO -> SJC\\n 3. Start with JFK, push JFK onto the stack.\\n 4. Stack: [JFK]\\n 5. JFK has destinations MUC. Push MUC onto the stack.\\n 6. Stack: [JFK, MUC]\\n 7. MUC has destinations LHR. Push LHR onto the stack.\\n 8. Stack: [JFK, MUC, LHR]\\n 9. LHR has destinations SFO. Push SFO onto the stack.\\n 10. Stack: [JFK, MUC, LHR, SFO]\\n 11. SFO has destination SJC. Push SJC onto the stack.\\n 12. Stack: [JFK, MUC, LHR, SFO, SJC]\\n 13. SJC has no remaining destinations. Pop SJC from the stack and add it to the itinerary list.\\n 14. Stack: [JFK, MUC, LHR, SFO]\\n 15. SFO has no remaining destinations. Pop SFO from the stack and add it to the itinerary list.\\n 16. Stack: [JFK, MUC, LHR]\\n 17. LHR has no remaining destinations. Pop LHR from the stack and add it to the itinerary list.\\n 18. Stack: [JFK, MUC]\\n 19. MUC has no remaining destinations.

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

                        "content": "If the cities/airports are considered the nodes of a graph and the tickets from one city to another the directed edges of this graph, this problem reduces to that of finding an Eulerian path in a directed graph.\\nFirst consider the related problem of finding an Eulerian circuit in the graph. There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

                        "content": "If the cities/airports are considered the nodes of a graph and the tickets from one city to another the directed edges of this graph, this problem reduces to that of finding an Eulerian path in a directed graph.\\nFirst consider the related problem of finding an Eulerian circuit in the graph. There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

There are multiple algorithms proposed for this, one of them follows:\\n**Algorithm 1**\\n1. Choose any starting vertex.\\n2. Find any cycle starting and ending at this vertex.\\n3. Find the Eulerian circuit starting at this vertex, after removing all the edges in the cycle chosen in the previous step.\\n4. Prepend all the edges in this cycle to the path found in the previous step.\\n5. The path so obtained is an Eulerian circuit in this graph.\\n\\nAssume a fixed starting vertex. Of all the circuits possible starting and ending at this vertex, one of them must be the lexicographical smallest (the set of all Eulerian circuits is finite as all the edges can be traversed exactly once, and thus this set is a subset of all permutations of the edges, which is finite; and the lexicographical order is a total order). This can be found greedily.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n**Algorithm 2**\\n1. Choose the lexicographically smallest cycle passing through the starting vertex.\\n2. Remove all edges in this cycle from the graph. Find the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit in the remaining graph.\\n3. Prepend the edges in the cycle in step 2 to the circuit in step 3.\\n4. The circuit so obtained is the Eulerian circuit of the graph.\\n\\nThis greedy algorithm is correct as it satisfies the two properties of a greedy algorithm.\\n1. Greedy choice: \\n\\tConsider the first cycle in the lexicographically smallest circuit. It is either the same cycle chosen by Algorithm 2, or it is a lexicographically larger cycle. If it is a lexicographically larger cycle, then it is a part of a lexicographically larger circuit than the circuit produced by this algorithm; a contradiction. Thus it must be the same cycle. Hence, a solution with the greedy choice exists.\\n2. Optimal substructure:\\n\\tConsider an optimal circuit for the subproblem. It must consist entirely of cycles not sharing any edges with the cycle chosen by Algorithm 2. Prepending this cycle to the circuit gives a circuit lexicographically lesser than or equal to that proposed in the greedy choice section. Since that circuit was the lexicographically smallest, so must this.\\n\\t\\nThus this algorithm is correct.\\n\\nNow to the original problem. An Eulerian path is clearly made up of one path connecting two vertices, on each of whose vertices there are Eulerian circuits, possibly empty. Thus the final algorithm:\\n\\n**Algorithm 3**\\n1. Let the starting node be the one corresponding to JFK.\\n2. Perform a DFS from this node choosing the lexicographically smallest target city at each stage, removing each edge from the graph as it is traversed and storing it separately. Some cycles may be found in this process. It is of no concern.\\n3. At some point, an edge will be reached from where there are no outgoing edges. There may have been edges coming into and going out of this node earlier, which were removed and stored earlier. Also there must have been exactly one more incoming edge than there were outgoing edges. This node exists because the question guarantees the existence of an Eulerian path, and it is a property of Eulerian paths that such a node must exist. In fact, there should also be a node with one extra outgoing edge, which in this question is the node corresponding to JFK.\\n4. Having found the path connecting the starting and ending vertices of the Eulerian path, the rest of the edges must form Eulerian sub-circuits, the lexicographically smallest of which can be found by Algorithm 2. Also, these sub-circuits must be \"attached\" at the last occurrence of the vertex in the path found in step 3, as the edges chosen in step 2 were the lexicographically smallest, and must come before the edges in this sub-circuit.\\n5. This way, the lexicographically smallest Eulerian circuit is formed.\\n\\nThis algorithm can be easily implemented using a stack."

An Eulerian path is a trail in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. The algorithm works well in this problem because of a few key properties:\\n\\n1. **Existence of Eulerian Path**: The problem guarantees that an Eulerian path exists, i.e., you can travel every \\'ticket\\' exactly once. This is confirmed by the problem\\'s condition that an answer always exists.\\n\\n2. **Directed Graph**: The tickets can be considered as directed edges in a graph. You can only go from the \"from\" airport to the \"to\" airport as specified on each ticket. Hierholzer\\'s algorithm can easily adapt to directed graphs.\\n\\n3. **Degree of Vertices**: In an Eulerian path, each vertex (except possibly for the start and end vertex) has an equal in-degree and out-degree. This means you can \\'enter\\' and \\'leave\\' each vertex the same number of times. In the problem, the number of tickets to enter an airport would be the same as the number to leave, except for JFK (the start) and possibly another airport if the path is not a circuit.\\n\\n4. **Dead Ends and Backtracking**: Hierholzer\\'s algorithm naturally handles dead ends via backtracking. When you hit a dead-end, you know you\\'ve traversed all outgoing edges (tickets) for that vertex (airport). You can then backtrack and continue traversing other unexplored edges, eventually forming the Eulerian path.\\n\\n5. **Lexicographic Ordering**: While Hierholzer\\'s doesn\\'t inherently give a lexicographically minimal path, you can achieve this by always choosing the smallest available vertex to visit next, which aligns well with the problem\\'s constraints.\\n\\nThe formal reasoning behind why Hierholzer\\'s works is fundamentally based on the properties of Eulerian paths and the constraints of the problem. Given the existence of an Eulerian path and the balanced in-degree and out-degree for each vertex, Hierholzer\\'s will construct the path by traversing each edge exactly once, thus providing a valid answer."

This is confirmed by the problem\\'s condition that an answer always exists.\\n\\n2. **Directed Graph**: The tickets can be considered as directed edges in a graph. You can only go from the \"from\" airport to the \"to\" airport as specified on each ticket. Hierholzer\\'s algorithm can easily adapt to directed graphs.\\n\\n3. **Degree of Vertices**: In an Eulerian path, each vertex (except possibly for the start and end vertex) has an equal in-degree and out-degree. This means you can \\'enter\\' and \\'leave\\' each vertex the same number of times. In the problem, the number of tickets to enter an airport would be the same as the number to leave, except for JFK (the start) and possibly another airport if the path is not a circuit.\\n\\n4. **Dead Ends and Backtracking**: Hierholzer\\'s algorithm naturally handles dead ends via backtracking. When you hit a dead-end, you know you\\'ve traversed all outgoing edges (tickets) for that vertex (airport). You can then backtrack and continue traversing other unexplored edges, eventually forming the Eulerian path.\\n\\n5. **Lexicographic Ordering**: While Hierholzer\\'s doesn\\'t inherently give a lexicographically minimal path, you can achieve this by always choosing the smallest available vertex to visit next, which aligns well with the problem\\'s constraints.\\n\\nThe formal reasoning behind why Hierholzer\\'s works is fundamentally based on the properties of Eulerian paths and the constraints of the problem. Given the existence of an Eulerian path and the balanced in-degree and out-degree for each vertex, Hierholzer\\'s will construct the path by traversing each edge exactly once, thus providing a valid answer."
