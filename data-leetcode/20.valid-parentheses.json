                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe problem requires us to determine if the given string of brackets is valid or not. We can use a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets encountered and check if they match with the corresponding closing brackets.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nHere is the step-by-step approach of the algorithm:\\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\\n\\n2. Traverse the input string character by character.\\n\\n3. If the current character is an opening bracket (i.e., \\'(\\', \\'{\\', \\'[\\'), push it onto the stack.\\n\\n4. If the current character is a closing bracket (i.e., \\')\\', \\'}\\', \\']\\'), check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, return false, because the closing bracket does not have a corresponding opening bracket. Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the current closing bracket. If it does not match, return false, because the brackets are not valid.\\n\\n5. After traversing the entire input string, if the stack is empty, return true, because all opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets. Otherwise, return false, because some opening brackets have not been matched with their corresponding closing brackets.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe time complexity of the solution is $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the input string. This is because we traverse the string once and perform constant time operations for each character.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe space complexity of the solution is $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the input string. This is because the worst-case scenario is when all opening brackets are present in the string and the stack will have to store them all.\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b427e686-2e5d-469a-8e7a-db5140022a6b_1677715904.0948765.png)\\n\\n\\n# Please Upvote\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\n```\\nThanks for visiting my solution.\\uD83D\\uDE0A Keep Learning\\nPlease give my solution an upvote! \\uD83D\\uDC4D\\nIt\\'s a simple way to show your appreciation and\\nkeep me motivated.

                "content": "# Intuition\\nMy initial approach to solving this problem involves using a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. As I iterate through the given string, I\\'ll push the corresponding closing bracket onto the stack whenever I encounter an opening bracket. If I encounter a closing bracket, I\\'ll check if it matches the top element of the stack. If it does, I\\'ll pop the top element from the stack. At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were properly closed, and the string is valid.\\n\\n# Approach\\nI will use a stack to maintain the order of opening brackets encountered. For each character in the given string, I will check if it is an opening bracket (\\'(\\', \\'{\\', \\'[\\'). If it is, I\\'ll push the corresponding closing bracket onto the stack. If it\\'s a closing bracket, I\\'ll compare it with the top element of the stack. If they match, I\\'ll pop the top element from the stack. If they don\\'t match or the stack is empty, the string is not valid. Finally, if the stack is empty after processing all characters, the string is valid.\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n)\\n  The algorithm iterates through the string once, and each operation inside the loop (stack push, pop, and isEmpty) takes constant time on average.\\n- Space complexity: O(n)\\n  In the worst case, the stack could store all the opening brackets in the string, resulting in a space complexity proportional to the input size.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean isValid(String s) {\\n         Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();\\n\\n        for (char x : s.toCharArray()\\n             ) {\\n\\n            if(x==\\'(\\'){\\n                \\n                stack.push(\\')\\');\\n            } else if (x==\\'{\\') {\\n                stack.push(\\'}\\');\\n                \\n            } else if (x==\\'[\\') {\\n                stack.push(\\']\\');\\n            } else if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop()!=x) {\\n\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n\\n        }\\n\\n\\n        return stack.isEmpty();\\n        \\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n![c0504eaf-5fb8-4a1d-a769-833262d1b86e_1674433591.3836212.webp](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/8a3b41d1-f0ca-472f-a9f7-8346b34a824e_1693297402.2918687.webp)",

So accordingly the order of the brackets matters much for example, if We have an opening bracket in order \"{ [ ( \" then the closing brackets should be \" ) ] }\".\\n\\nSo to deal with this problem we have to look for the data structure called Stack which follows FILO or LIFO.\\n\\nSo we will iterate through the given string, push the opening brackets in a stack, and pop them if we get matching closing brackets on the top.\\n\\nNow let\\'s understand this all with an $Example$.\\n\\nGiven String = \" { [ ( { } ) ] } \"\\n\\nNow let\\'s iterate through String and push opening Brackets inside the stack which will look like this:\\n\\n![imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-l0H1xJQgK7x.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/a12b809b-2ad5-414c-92d7-5dd416f25a1d_1675631379.698946.png)\\n\\n\\nNow when we Ittrate further we will start getting closing Brackets Now we will pop the Open Brackets in our Stack if and only if the closing brackets match the opening bracket on the top of the stack.\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/cb637454-43f0-4704-ab01-13550802d2ea_1675631584.836981.png)\\n\\nSo as we Can see closing bracket matches with the opening bracket on the top of the stack so now we will pop it.\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/837e04fb-5cb6-476f-ae8b-0b42b4d9b601_1675548125.451662.png)\\n\\nNow in the same way we will pop further remaining opening brackets if we get its matching closing bracket.\\n\\nFinally, after iteration is over we will get an empty stack which means Every opening bracket has got its appropriate pair.\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/6059051f-53f6-45a8-a9f5-f709cce7eab9_1675549053.0110495.png)\\n\\nAnd if the Stack is not Empty this means the is some missing pair or mismatch of the pair of the closing bracket and opening bracket.\\n\\n**Key Point :**\\n\\n**1.

We\\'ll use the help of Stack to solve this problem.\\n\\n***Just follow my step\\'s you\\'ll gonna understand***\\n\\n* Our First step is if we find an opening bracket there only 3 types of opening bracket possible. **Circular \\'(\\'**, **Spquare \\'[\\'** & **Curly \\'{\\'** if we find any of these we will put into our stack.\\n\\n\\n* After filling any of these into our stack, while moving forward if we find any of closing bracket we will pop it out. But there will be **3 cases**, **first one** the closing bracket has to be similar to opening bracket. If they are not similar we gonna simply return false, from there. **Second case** if we pop out every element means our `stack is empty` but we left with one more closing bracket, we gonna simply return false. **Third case** we will pop out every elemnt as they all are similar to their opening one. \\n* Finally in the end we\\'ll check if the stack becomes empty **return true** otherwise stack is not empty **return false**.   \\n\\nLet\\'s understand it visually:-\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/9a121388-3f2f-48f4-9fa7-77e629396a65_1647142941.9872801.gif)\\n\\n*Ihope Ladies - n - Gentlemen approach is clear* **Let\\'s code it up, then**\\n\\n**Java**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean isValid(String s) {\\n        // We need a stack\\n        Stack<Character> st = new Stack<>();\\n        // iterate over all the character\\'s available in the string\\n        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){\\n            char ch = s.charAt(i);\\n            // if we find opening then put in the stack\\n            if(ch == \\'(\\' || ch == \\'{\\' || ch == \\'[\\'){\\n                st.push(ch);\\n            }\\n            // if we find closing then there could be 3 condition\\'s\\n            else if(ch == \\')\\'){\\n                // if stack is empty return false\\n                if(st.isEmpty()) return false;\\n                // if the opening element we want is not equals to that present in stack return false \\n                else if(st.peek() != \\'(\\') return false;\\n                // if it\\'s the one we want pop it from stack\\n                else st.pop();\\n            }\\n            // similar for these as well\\n            else if(ch == \\']\\'){\\n                if(st.isEmpty()) return false;\\n                else if(st.peek() != \\'[\\') return false;\\n                else st.pop();\\n            }\\n            else if(ch == \\'}\\'){\\n                if(st.isEmpty()) return false;\\n                else if(st.peek() != \\'{\\') return false;\\n                else st.pop();\\n            }\\n        }\\n        // once we have pop each and every element it\\'s time to check, wether our stack is empty or not\\n        if(st.isEmpty()) return true; // if it\\'s return true\\n        return false; // otherwise return false;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**C++**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool isValid(string s) {\\n        // We need a stack\\n        stack<char> st;\\n        // iterate over all the character\\'s available in the string\\n        for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++){\\n            // if we find opening then put in the stack\\n            if(s[i] == \\'(\\' || s[i] == \\'{\\' || s[i] == \\'[\\'){\\n                st.push(s[i]);\\n            }\\n            // if we find closing then there could be 3 condition\\'s\\n            else if(s[i] == \\')\\'){\\n                // if stack is empty return false\\n                if(st.empty()) return false;\\n                // if the opening element we want is not equals to that present in stack return false \\n                else if(st.top() != \\'(\\') return false;\\n                // if it\\'s the one we want pop it from stack\\n                else st.pop();\\n            }\\n            // similar for these as well\\n            else if(s[i] == \\']\\'){\\n                if(st.empty()) return false;\\n                else if(st.top() != \\'[\\') return false;\\n                else st.pop();\\n            }\\n            else if(s[i] == \\'}\\'){\\n                if(st.empty()) return false;\\n                else if(st.top() != \\'{\\') return false;\\n                else st.pop();\\n            }\\n        }\\n        // once we have pop each and every element it\\'s time to check, wether our stack is empty or not\\n        if(st.empty()) return true; // if it\\'s return true\\n        return false; // otherwise return false;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nANALYSIS:-\\n* **Time Complexity :-** BigO(N)\\n\\n* **Space Complexity :-** BigO(N)",

I defeated a lot of edge cases in `O(1)` with basic + modulus check\\n\\t- It just makes sense that if a string has a odd length, we don\\'t need to waste any more time and just immediately return `false`\\n\\t- eg. `[](`, `{}]`, `}{}` there will never be a length of 3 items that will equate to returning `true`\\n2. The moment we encounter a character that can\\'t pop from the stack, immediately break from the loop and return `false`\\n3. Just add a `!` to turn the value into a boolean data type while also flipping the result\\n\\n\\n```\\n// 1\\nif (s.length === 0) return true\\nif (s.length === 1) return false\\nif (s.length % 2 !== 0) return false\\n\\nconst dictionary = {\\n\\t\\'}\\': \\'{\\',\\n\\t\\')\\': \\'(\\',\\n\\t\\']\\': \\'[\\'\\n}\\nconst stack = []\\n\\nfor (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {\\n\\tconst currChar = s[i]\\n\\tconst lastChar = stack[stack.length - 1]\\n\\tconst delChar = dictionary[currChar]\\n\\n\\tif (delChar) {\\n\\t\\t// 2\\n\\t\\tif (delChar === lastChar) {\\n\\t\\t\\tstack.pop()\\n\\t\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t\\treturn false\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t} else {\\n\\t\\tstack.push(currChar)\\n\\t}\\n}\\n\\n// 3\\nreturn !stack.length\\n```\\n\\nThe other route with a non-flipped dictionary.\\n\\nI won\\'t write any code for this but explain why this similar approach is not optimized.\\nIf you flip the dictionary, instead of using a stack you\\'ll have to use a queue. With a queue you have to use the `unshift()` and `shift()` methods and those operations are in `O(n)` versus using `O(1)` with `pop()` and `push()`. Overall the time complexity is roughly ~`O(n)` regardless of either method but one is clearly has less operations than the other :)",

A Dictionary is also used to map open brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.\\n\\nHere\\'s an overview of the code step-by-step:\\n\\n- Initialize the Dictionary `bracketsMap` to store the mapping of open brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.\\n- Create a Stack `openBrackets` to store the open brackets as they are encountered in the input string.\\n- Iterate over each character in the input string `s`.\\n- If the character is an open bracket, push it onto the Stack `openBrackets`.\\n- If the character is a closing bracket, pop the top element from the Stack `openBrackets` and compare it with the corresponding closing bracket in the Dictionary `bracketsMap`. If the popped bracket and the corresponding bracket in the Dictionary do not match, return false as the input string is not valid.\\n- Repeat the process for each character in the input string.\\n- If the Stack `openBrackets` is empty at the end of the loop, return true, indicating that the input string is valid.\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n`O(n)`, where n is the length of the input string. The reason is that each character in the input string is processed only once, and the operations of pushing and popping elements onto the Stack and accessing elements in the Dictionary have a constant time complexity. \\n- Space complexity:\\n`O(n)`, as the Stack openBrackets may store up to n elements, in the worst case scenario where each character in the input string is an open bracket.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public bool IsValid(string s) {\\n        Dictionary<char, char> bracketsMap = new Dictionary<char, char>{\\n            {\\'{\\',  \\'}\\'},\\n            {\\'(\\',  \\')\\'},\\n            {\\'[\\',  \\']\\'},\\n        };\\n        Stack<char> openBrackets = new Stack<char>();\\n        \\n        foreach (char bracket in s) {\\n            if (bracketsMap.ContainsKey(bracket)) {\\n                openBrackets.Push(bracket);\\n            } else {\\n                 if (openBrackets.Count == 0) {\\n                    return false;\\n                }\\n                if (bracketsMap[openBrackets.Pop()] == bracket) {\\n                    continue;\\n                };\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return openBrackets.Count == 0;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```",

So i used *String openBrackets = \"{([\"; with function openBrackets.indexOf(s.charAt(i)) > -1*\\n- if **indexOf()** returns anything >-1 that is incoming character was an open bracket\\n- else if **indexOf()** return -1 then it was a close bracket as such charcter was not present in string openBrackets.\\n3) Once identified, if open bracket push to stack, if closing bracket then handle conditions\\n- if stack is empty we cannot push a close bracket first so false\\n- if open bracket on stack\\'s top doesn\\'t matches the closing bracket return false ex \\'{\\' should match \\'}\\', \\'[\\' should match \\']\\'\\n- else remove top charcter from stack\\n4) At end of loop if stack is not empty then there are open brackets remaining in the stack so return false, true otherwise\\n \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(n): As we go through all the characters once in the string.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(n): In the worst case we can have a max of n characters in stack\\n\\n---\\n\\nHope it is easy to understand.\\nLet me know if there is something unclear and i can fix it.\\n\\nOtherwise, please upvote if you like the solution, it would be encouraging\\n\\n-----\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean isValid(String s) {\\n        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();\\n        String openBrackets = \"{([\";\\n        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++){\\n            Character temp = s.charAt(i);\\n            if(openBrackets.indexOf(temp)> -1){\\n                stack.add(temp);\\n            }else{\\n                /* handles all cases for close brackets }]) */\\n                if(stack.isEmpty()){\\n                    return false;\\n                }else if(helper(stack.peek())!=temp){\\n                    return false;\\n                }else{\\n                    stack.pop();\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return stack.empty() ? true : false;\\n    }\\n\\n    private Character helper(Character left){\\n        // methode returns what closing bracket should be on comparison with right bracket \\n        if(left == \\'(\\'){\\n            return \\')\\';\\n        }else if(left == \\'{\\'){\\n            return \\'}\\';\\n        }else{\\n            return \\']\\';\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Creating a **dict** with **open-bracket as key** and **close-bracket as value**.\\n2. Creating an **empty list**.\\n3. Looping through the string of brackets.\\n    1. If the **current character** is an opened bracket we\\'ll append it to the list.\\n    2. Else if the current character is a closed bracket of the last opened we **delete** the last opened, else we exit the loop and return False.\\n4. If the list is empty after looping (*that means that all opened brackets were closed correctly*), the string is **valid**.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:\\n        d = {\\'(\\':\\')\\', \\'{\\':\\'}\\',\\'[\\':\\']\\'}\\n        m = []\\n\\n        for x in s:\\n            if x in d:\\n                m.append(x)\\n\\n            else: \\n                if len(m) and d[m[-1]] == x:\\n                    del m[-1]\\n                else:\\n                    return False\\n\\n        return not m\\n\\n```",

As stack is LIFO structure so if for each open parenthesis such as ( OR { OR [ we have to insert corresponding closing parenthesis ) OR } OR ] .\\n\\nSo each time we iterate and get an open parenthesis we push the closing parenthesis and if we encounter a closing parenthesis we check and pop depending on the comparison .We can first ignore the ones which are of off length . At the enf of the program we have to check if the stack is empty or not . if not it\\'s false . Vice versa .\\n\\n```\\n\\nclass Solution {\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @param String $s\\n     * @return Boolean\\n     */\\n    function isValid($s) {\\n        if(strlen($s)%2!=0){\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        \\n        $process_arr = array();\\n        $s_arr = str_split($s);\\n        foreach($s_arr as $i){\\n            switch($i){\\n                case \\'(\\':\\n                    array_push($process_arr,\\')\\');\\n                    break;\\n                case \\'{\\':\\n                    array_push($process_arr,\\'}\\');\\n                    break;\\n                case \\'[\\':\\n                    array_push($process_arr,\\']\\');\\n                    break;\\n                default:\\n                    if(empty($process_arr) || $i != $process_arr[count($process_arr)-1]){\\n                        return false;\\n                    }else{\\n                        array_pop($process_arr);\\n                    }\\n                    break;\\n                \\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return count($process_arr)==0;\\n        \\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n```\\n\\n```\\n```\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is ***0ms / 1.17MB*** (beats 99.64% / 99.92%).\\n* *** C ***\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\nbool isValid(char *s) {\\n\\n    char *q=s;\\n    \\n    for (char *p=s; *p; p++) \\n        switch(*p) {\\n            case \\'(\\': *q++ = \\')\\'; continue;\\n            case \\'{\\': *q++ = \\'}\\'; continue;\\n            case \\'[\\': *q++ = \\']\\'; continue;\\n            default: if (q==s || *p != *--q) return false;\\n        }\\n    \\n    return q==s;\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n     Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();\\n    if(s.length()%2 != 0)\\n        return false;\\n    for(int i = 0;i<s.length();i++){\\n        if(s.charAt(i) == \\'(\\' || s.charAt(i) == \\'{\\' || s.charAt(i) == \\'[\\')\\n            stack.push(s.charAt(i));\\n        else if(stack.size() > 0 && s.charAt(i) == \\')\\' && stack.peek() == \\'(\\')\\n            stack.pop();\\n        else if(stack.size() > 0 && s.charAt(i) == \\'}\\' && stack.peek() == \\'{\\')\\n            stack.pop();\\n        else if(stack.size() > 0 && s.charAt(i) == \\']\\' && stack.peek() == \\'[\\')\\n            stack.pop();\\n        else \\n            return false;\\n    }\\n    return stack.size() == 0;\\n```\\n\\n```\\n```\\n\\n```\\n```\\n\\n***\"Open your eyes.

This is correct but doesn\\'t tell the right DS to use because we can\\'t see in the future iterations in advance. So, think inversely.\\n\\nIf we see closing brace, there should have been an opening brace to pair with. This means, we want to look at past values in reverse order. Only stacks gives us the option to look in reverse.\\n\\nWe can either write recursive function, or write iterative function with a stack.\\n\\nPossible failures that we should consider when writing code:\\n1. We want to look at the top value in the stack. If stack is empty and we try to access the top value, we\\'ll get index out of bound exception. So, always check len(stack) > 0.\\n2. After the end of iteration, if we just return True, that will be an incorrect output for some inputs. Either we have found all the pairs or have unpaired braces still stored in the stack. So, check the length of the stack again and return True if stack is empty.\\n\\n**Iterative solution:**\\n\\n```\\ndef isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:\\n\\tpairs = {\\')\\':\\'(\\', \\n\\t\\t\\t \\']\\':\\'[\\', \\n\\t\\t\\t \\'}\\':\\'{\\'}\\n\\n\\tstack = []\\n\\tfor char in s:\\n\\t\\tif char in pairs and len(stack)>0:\\n\\t\\t\\topeningBrace = pairs[char]\\n\\t\\t\\tif stack[-1] != openingBrace:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n\\t\\t\\tstack.pop()\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tstack.append(char)\\n\\n\\treturn len(stack)==0\\n```\\n\\n**I hope that you\\'ve found this useful.\\nIn that case, please upvote.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns false."

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

I was about to go 3d array to store each set but it was so logically complex I almost quit. Then I saw it. So this problem could considered medium if you didn\\'t see the easy answer. Overall, a very clever question. It had so many caveats that I kept getting rejected and it was giving me pstd by the end. lol.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns false."

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns false."

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns false."

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

I was about to go 3d array to store each set but it was so logically complex I almost quit. Then I saw it. So this problem could considered medium if you didn\\'t see the easy answer. Overall, a very clever question. It had so many caveats that I kept getting rejected and it was giving me pstd by the end. lol.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

Like Agile and algorithms, they are very important to the professional.\\n\\nI strongly suggest clarifying the fact that the coder should allow for nested parentheses and that the nesting may be complex.\\n\\nRather than this wording, \"Open brackets must be closed in the CORRECT order.\"  (In whose mind?)\\n\\nI strongly suggest this: \"For strings that involve complex nesting, each bracket must be closed in the correct order.\"\\n\\nThis makes clear that \"correct\" is referring to nesting order, not front to back, or first open, or outside to inside, or some other \"correct\" order."

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns false."

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns false."

If it is, the corresponding closing bracket is pushed onto the stack. For example, if the character is (, the character ) is pushed onto the stack.\\nIf the character is a closing bracket: ), ], or }, the code checks whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function returns false. If the stack is not empty, the last opening bracket is removed from the stack and checked against the current closing bracket. If the brackets do not match, the function returns false.\\nAfter looping through all the characters in the input string, the function checks whether the stack is empty. If it is, it means that all the opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns true.

This outcome aligns with the typical expectation that an opening bracket should be followed by a corresponding closing bracket. However, when an opening bracket is placed within another pair of brackets and the closing bracket for the innermost pair is positioned outside, the result is also \"false.\" This discrepancy occurs because the closing bracket, although appearing outside the inner pair, effectively closes the innermost bracket, making it distinct from the opening bracket outside. In such cases, even though the bracket appears outside, it is still considered a different bracket from the one inside, resulting in an unbalanced configuration."

Let's use the example \"()\", we enter the for loop and the current index of i = 0 while the value of i = '('. Since i is an opening bracket at this point we push it into the stack and we start at the beginning of the for loop again. Now the index of i = 1 and the value of i = ')'. This skips over the \"if\" and enters the \"else\". At this point our stack isn't empty, so stack.top() == '(' and i = ')' is a closing bracket, so the if statement isn't satisfied. We then do stack.pop() (which will pop '(') because there is a corresponding closing bracket for the open bracket. Now outside of the for loop we return stack.empty() because if the stack is empty at this point we know that their a valid pair of brackets/parentheses. \n\nThis is a walkthrough of the entire code, but essentially even if return true does work instead of return stack.empty(), it doesn't utilize the stack."

Let's use the example \"()\", we enter the for loop and the current index of i = 0 while the value of i = '('. Since i is an opening bracket at this point we push it into the stack and we start at the beginning of the for loop again. Now the index of i = 1 and the value of i = ')'. This skips over the \"if\" and enters the \"else\". At this point our stack isn't empty, so stack.top() == '(' and i = ')' is a closing bracket, so the if statement isn't satisfied. We then do stack.pop() (which will pop '(') because there is a corresponding closing bracket for the open bracket. Now outside of the for loop we return stack.empty() because if the stack is empty at this point we know that their a valid pair of brackets/parentheses. \n\nThis is a walkthrough of the entire code, but essentially even if return true does work instead of return stack.empty(), it doesn't utilize the stack."

Let's use the example \"()\", we enter the for loop and the current index of i = 0 while the value of i = '('. Since i is an opening bracket at this point we push it into the stack and we start at the beginning of the for loop again. Now the index of i = 1 and the value of i = ')'. This skips over the \"if\" and enters the \"else\". At this point our stack isn't empty, so stack.top() == '(' and i = ')' is a closing bracket, so the if statement isn't satisfied. We then do stack.pop() (which will pop '(') because there is a corresponding closing bracket for the open bracket. Now outside of the for loop we return stack.empty() because if the stack is empty at this point we know that their a valid pair of brackets/parentheses. \n\nThis is a walkthrough of the entire code, but essentially even if return true does work instead of return stack.empty(), it doesn't utilize the stack."

Let's use the example \"()\", we enter the for loop and the current index of i = 0 while the value of i = '('. Since i is an opening bracket at this point we push it into the stack and we start at the beginning of the for loop again. Now the index of i = 1 and the value of i = ')'. This skips over the \"if\" and enters the \"else\". At this point our stack isn't empty, so stack.top() == '(' and i = ')' is a closing bracket, so the if statement isn't satisfied. We then do stack.pop() (which will pop '(') because there is a corresponding closing bracket for the open bracket. Now outside of the for loop we return stack.empty() because if the stack is empty at this point we know that their a valid pair of brackets/parentheses. \n\nThis is a walkthrough of the entire code, but essentially even if return true does work instead of return stack.empty(), it doesn't utilize the stack."

Let's use the example \"()\", we enter the for loop and the current index of i = 0 while the value of i = '('. Since i is an opening bracket at this point we push it into the stack and we start at the beginning of the for loop again. Now the index of i = 1 and the value of i = ')'. This skips over the \"if\" and enters the \"else\". At this point our stack isn't empty, so stack.top() == '(' and i = ')' is a closing bracket, so the if statement isn't satisfied. We then do stack.pop() (which will pop '(') because there is a corresponding closing bracket for the open bracket. Now outside of the for loop we return stack.empty() because if the stack is empty at this point we know that their a valid pair of brackets/parentheses. \n\nThis is a walkthrough of the entire code, but essentially even if return true does work instead of return stack.empty(), it doesn't utilize the stack."

Let's use the example \"()\", we enter the for loop and the current index of i = 0 while the value of i = '('. Since i is an opening bracket at this point we push it into the stack and we start at the beginning of the for loop again. Now the index of i = 1 and the value of i = ')'. This skips over the \"if\" and enters the \"else\". At this point our stack isn't empty, so stack.top() == '(' and i = ')' is a closing bracket, so the if statement isn't satisfied. We then do stack.pop() (which will pop '(') because there is a corresponding closing bracket for the open bracket. Now outside of the for loop we return stack.empty() because if the stack is empty at this point we know that their a valid pair of brackets/parentheses. \n\nThis is a walkthrough of the entire code, but essentially even if return true does work instead of return stack.empty(), it doesn't utilize the stack."

Let's use the example \"()\", we enter the for loop and the current index of i = 0 while the value of i = '('. Since i is an opening bracket at this point we push it into the stack and we start at the beginning of the for loop again. Now the index of i = 1 and the value of i = ')'. This skips over the \"if\" and enters the \"else\". At this point our stack isn't empty, so stack.top() == '(' and i = ')' is a closing bracket, so the if statement isn't satisfied. We then do stack.pop() (which will pop '(') because there is a corresponding closing bracket for the open bracket. Now outside of the for loop we return stack.empty() because if the stack is empty at this point we know that their a valid pair of brackets/parentheses. \n\nThis is a walkthrough of the entire code, but essentially even if return true does work instead of return stack.empty(), it doesn't utilize the stack."
