First, whe have `12` hours in total, for `360` degrees, that means `30` degrees per hour. Also, for every `60` minutes, our hour hand rotated by `1` hour, that is `30` degrees, so for every minute, it is rotated by `0.5` degrees. So, final place for hour hand is `30*hour + 0.5*minutes`\\n2. Let us find the place, where **minute hand** is: every `60` minutes minute hand makes full rotation, that means we have `6` degrees for each minute.\\n3. Finally, we evaluate absolute difference between these two numbers, and if angle is more than `180` degrees, we return complementary angle.\\n\\n**Complexity**: time and space is `O(1)`, we just use some mathematical formulae.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def angleClock(self, hour, minutes):\\n        H_place = 30*hour + 0.5*minutes\\n        M_place = 6*minutes\\n        diff = abs(H_place - M_place)\\n        return diff if diff <= 180 else 360 - diff\\n```\\n\\n**Oneliner**\\nWe can write this as oneliner as well:\\n```\\nreturn min(abs(30*hour-5.5*minutes),360-abs(30*hour-5.5*minutes))\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Relation between hour and minute hand (Hint 1)\\nNow if minute hand is at 6 i.e. 30 min hour hand goes to 2.5 min.\\ni.e. out of 60 min hand covers 30 min and out of 5 min hour hand covers 2.5.\\nWe can see the ratio here.\\nso for every minute hour hand goes by 0.5 minutes.\\n\\nSo we can find both hour angle and minute angle and see their difference. Also as the question wants us to return the shorter angle we can to perforn 360 - diff and see if it smaller than diff.\\n#### Steps:\\n1. For hour hand we perform hour % 12 and then mutilply it to magnitude of 30deg.\\n``hour_angle = (hour % 12 ) * 30 + ratio`` - ``ratio = minutes * 0.5``\\n2.

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n***Note:** For complete code, please scroll to the end. Detailed explanation continues below.*\\n\\n*This is a very easy and intuitive problem. Not sure why this is marked as a medium problem in Leetcode.*\\n\\nIf we set a standard unit of position measurement we can use the minute value to count the exact position(including extra displacement) of the hour hand. For example, if the time is 12:30, then hour hand is exactly at middle position of 12 and 1. To find the standard position we can use below formula:\\n\\nhourPosition = hour*(unit/12) + (unit/12)*(minute/60)\\n\\nHere,\\nhourPosition=exact position of hour hand\\nunit=total size of the clock in our new unit of mesaurement\\n\\nFor convenience, we can select unit as 60 minutes(unit=60) which is equivalent to 1 hour. This will mean that we won\\'t have to change our minute value to our new unit of measurement. We can later after finding our answer using this unit, calculate it with respect to 360 degree.\\n\\nNew formula becomes:\\n\\nhourPosition = hour*(5) + (5)*(minute/60)\\n\\nWe only have to keep 1 edge case in mind here that our hour input can have a value of 12. For such cases, we have to convert it to 0.\\n\\nAlso this might give us the bigger angle instead of the smaller angle. For this issue we can subtract the angle found from 360 and take the smaller value of the two.\\n\\n# Detailed Explanation/Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nFirst we take care of the edge case inline in our input.\\n\\n```\\nif(hour==12)\\n    hour=0;\\n```\\nNext we find the exact hour positions and minute positions. Since our output needs to be in double we will make the calculation accordingly and store it in a double variable. For hour position we will store it in hourDegree and for minute position we will store it in minDegree.\\n\\nFirst we find the hour position. Since our hour and minute values are integer always but we need double value, we calculate minutes/60.00 instead of minutes/60. This will make the rest of the calculation also happen using doubles due to implicit typecasting.\\n\\n```\\ndouble hourDegree=hour*5+(5*(minutes/60.00));\\n```\\nFor minute position, since our unit is also equivalent to minutes, we simply store the minute value to minPosition. Here also implicit typecasting takes care of integer to double conversion.\\n\\n```\\ndouble minDegree=minutes;\\n```\\nNext we find the difference between the positions and calculate the angle. For that we have to first calcualte the absolute difference of positions i.e. `abs(hourDegree-minDegree)`. Now, since our unit was equivalent to minutes, that means a whole rotation of the clock will give us 60 positions. That means 360 degree is reduced to 60 positions. So to convert it to degree, we have to multiply by 360/60 i.e. 6.\\n\\n```\\ndouble res=abs(hourDegree-minDegree)*6.00;\\n```\\nNow we have our angle in res variable. However, this might be the bigger angle. Since the smaller and bigger angles are complement of each other, we can simply take the difference of 360.00(we need to do calculation in doubles) and res and return the value which is less among res and 360.00-res.\\n\\n```\\nreturn min(res,360.00-res);\\n```\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nSince we don\\'t have any loops and our calculations are also basic, the TC is $$O(1)$$.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nOur SC is also $$O(1)$$ as we don\\'t have any variable sized containers.\\n\\n# Complete Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {\\n        if(hour==12)\\n         hour=0;\\n        double hourDegree=hour*5+(5*(minutes/60.00));\\n        double minDegree=minutes;\\n        double res=abs(hourDegree-minDegree)*6.00;\\n        return min(res,360.00-res);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/fe61a7ef-7c8d-4bcd-92b4-712cb72cbfee_1672094790.9694436.png)\\n\\nIf this helped you, please leave an upvote.

Thus, we used modulo. Then, if it is one hour and 60 minutes, its basically two hours. Therefore, to calculate the additional angle, we divide the minutes by 60, and then multiply by 30.

This will be one of the two angles, using this we can  obtain the result.\\n\\nFor simple understanding lets consider **12:00** as *arbitrary position*.

Calculate the angle swept by both hands(\\u2220Hour and \\u2220Minute). Angle swept by any hand can be calculated by considering the fact that Clock can be divided into:\\n* 12 sectors of (360/12=) **30 degrees** for calculating \\u2220Hour,\\n* 60 sectors of (360/60=) **6 degrees** for calculating \\u2220Minute and \\u2220Hour\\n* Hour hand also moves every minute by **(30 / 60) = 0.5 degrees** Hence in *m* minutes it will move by  **(30 *  m / 60) degrees**\\n```\\n    angleH = 30 * (h + m / 60F);  // i.e. (30 * h) + (30 * m / 60)\\n    angleM = 6 * m; // i.e. 360 * m / 60\\n```\\n\\n2. Find the absolute difference between swept angles i.e. (say) **\\u03B8 = |\\u2220Hour - \\u2220Minute|**.\\n*\\u03B8* and *360 - \\u03B8* as the two angles between both hand.\\n```\\n    theta = Math.abs(angleH - angleM);\\n````\\n3. Find the smaller angle between *\\u03B8* and *360 - \\u03B8*. **Result = min(\\u03B8, 360-\\u03B8)**\\n```\\n    return Math.min(theta, 360-theta); \\n```\\nNote: Implementation has simplified expression for ```\\u03B8``` (or ```theta```)\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b0a42dbc-f3dc-4e4f-a322-92075a59c9aa_1594890188.0851424.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n     \\n",

                "content": "# Approach\\nImagine the clock as a circle, and then think through this:\\n- one complete rotation around the circle is 360 degrees\\n- the clock (circle) is divided into 12 labels (hours from 1 through 12)\\n- what is the angle between two consecutive labels? 360 / 12 = 30\\n- - another way to think this is the opposite way: if 30 is added 12 times it makes 360!\\n\\nMoving forward\\n- observe that when needle shows 5 minutes, it is physically at label 1. For 15 minutes it is at label 3, for 45 at label 9.\\n- - the above fact can be represented as `min / 5 = label`\\n\\nWhy the above stuff?\\nImage it\\'s 12:30 on the clock, so hour label is obviously 12. What about the minute label? 30 / 5 = 6. So, 12 to 6. What\\'s the difference: 12 - 6 = 6. In other words, the clock shows two needles which have covered 6 consecutive labels from hour label to minute label. What is the angle between these labels: 6 * 30 = 180. **(Not exactly, as explained below - but undertanding like this will make it easier to get to the tricky part)**\\n\\n# **Tricky part**\\nOur assumptions in the above walkthrough have kept the hour needle constant. That is, we assume that the hour needle **does not** move from its position and just jumps to next label when an hour passes. \\uD83D\\uDE27 This is not the case:\\n- observe that as the minute needle moves through, the hour needle slowly moves too.\\n- as 60 minutes pass, the hour needle slowly progresses to the next hour\\n\\nIf you observe the images in the problem description tab, there are 3 images of clocks. Take, for example, the clock with 12:30. Observe that the hour needle is not exactly at 12. Its **halfway** through 12 and 1.\\n- when the minutes needle is at 30, hour needle moves *halfway or 50% or 0.5* to the next hour\\n- when the minutes needle is at 15, hour neendle moves to 25% or 0.25 to the next hour\\n\\nThis can be represented mathematically as `minutes / 60`\\n>30 / 60 = 0.50\\\\\\n>45 / 60 = 0.75\\n>60 / 60 = 1.00\\n>15 / 60 = 0.25\\n>23 / 60 = 0.38\\n\\nSo, we have to keep in mind this displacement of hour needle as well and add it to the original hour needle position.\\n\\n## Another tricky bit\\n*(This one kept me scratching my head for 20 minutes - It shouldnt have but still...)*\\n\\nNote that two needles in a clock can be at 180 degrees at max, not beyond that. So, if the calculated angle becomes greater than 180, just subtract it from 360.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {\\n\\n        double minToHLabel = minutes / 5.0;\\n  \\n        double disp = (double) 1/60 * minutes;\\n        \\n        double diff = (hour + disp) - minToHLabel;\\n        \\n\\t\\t// absolute difference (Math.abs can be used aswell) \\n        if (diff < 0){\\n            diff = diff * - 1;\\n        }\\n        \\n\\t\\t// if the calculated angle is greater than 180, return after subtracting from 360\\n        if (diff * 30 > 180){\\n            return 360 - diff * 30;\\n        }\\n        else {\\n            return diff * 30;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

                "content": "1. For every 1 hour (60 minutes) that is completed on a clock, the minutes pointer rotates 360 degrees. This means that for every 1 minute, the minutes pointer moved 6 degrees.\\n2. For every 12 hours, the hours pointer completes 360 degrees, which means that the hour pointer moves 30 degrees every hour.\\n3. The main point to remember here is that the hour pointer doesn\\'t remain at a static position between every hour that passes, but it covers a certain degree as the minutes keep passing by. It is important to calculate the degree of movement and add it to the total degree that the hours pointer moves.\\n\\nAs an example, let us consider when the time is 12:30. While the minutes pointer moves by 180 degrees at this time (30 * 6), the hour pointer moves by 0.5 degrees every 1 minute,as calculated below:\\n\\n360 degrees = 12 hours\\n30 degrees = 1 hour\\n30 degrees = 60 minutes => 0.5 degrees every minute. In this example, where the minutes is at 30, we can thus infer that the hours pointer has moved 15 degrees. We thus calculate the hoursAngle and minutesAngle.\\n\\n```\\n public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {\\n        double hourAngle = 30*(hour%12) + 0.5*(minutes);\\n        double minuteAngle = 6*(minutes);\\n        \\n        double result = Math.abs(hourAngle-minuteAngle);\\n        //min angle to be returned.\\n        return Math.min(result, 360-result);\\n    }\\n```",

When the value goes over `180`, you take the extra and count backward. \\nStarting from `12:00`, or `0 degrees`, you can simply count forward by `5.5`. Ex: When the value reaches `181.5`, you take the shorter angle: `180 - 1.5 = 178.5`\\n\\n```\\n//hour * 60 gives us the number of ticks forward from the hour\\n//minutes tells us how many additional ticks forward\\n//multiply by 5.5 degrees per tick\\n//mod by 360 because it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s rotated a full circle\\n//use min to get the smaller of the 2 angles formed\\n\\ndouble b = (((hour % 12) * 60 + minutes) * 5.5) % 360;\\nreturn Math.min(b, 360 - b);\\n```\\nThe `hour % 12` is so that 12:00 is treated as the beginning, aka 0 steps forward in time, rather than the end, 720 steps forward in time.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is that there are 361 unique outputs for this function, so you could easily precompute all the values, and store them if this method was going to be called many many times. The possible output values are `[0, 180]` *in steps of* `0.5`\\n\\nAdditionally, if you\\'re allowing complex numbers, you can use the following function to directly compute the result with all arithmetic:\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/cdfe5fe3-28ba-4229-a9dd-f440093a0d3d_1594795935.0496445.png)\\n\\n`Re` means only the `real` portion of the complex number, and `Im` means only the imaginary part.\\n\\nThe input `x` is the number of minutes since the angle between the hands was `0 degrees`. The graph of the function looks like this:\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/4b1cb2af-ada0-41ce-bd98-d0c63711f672_1594794620.6631007.png)\\n\\nCheck out this desmos playground to visualize the graph :)\\nhttps://www.desmos.com/calculator/n7xtljtues\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/n7xtljtues?embed\" width=\"500px\" height=\"500px\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc\" frameborder=0></iframe>",

                "content": "The first thing we want to do is map minutes to degrees. A simple way to logically do so is to solve for the ratio D in the proportion:\\nD = 360deg/60min = 6deg/1min;\\n\\nThen, x minutes in degrees is represented by:\\nM(x) = (x)min * D \\n\\t\\t = (x)min * (6)deg/min\\n\\t\\t = (6x)deg\\n\\nGiven that 5 minute increments also correspond to one hour on the clock:\\nM(5) = (6(5))deg\\n\\t\\t= 30deg;\\n\\nThe ith hour in degrees can be found by:\\nH_base(i) = i * 30deg;\\n\\nTo find the hour hand\\'s actual offset from it\\'s base:\\nH_offset(m) = M(5) * (M(m) / 360deg)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t= 30deg * ((6m)deg / 360deg)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t= 30deg * 6m/360\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t= (m/2)deg\\n\\nThe total displacement, therefore, is:\\nH(h, m) = H_base(h) + H_offset(m)\\n\\t\\t\\t = h * 30deg + (m/2)deg\\n\\t\\t\\t = (30h + m/2)deg\\n\\nNow that we have H(h,m) and M(m), we can take the absolute value of their difference:\\nLet L = ABS(m - h).\\nBasically, the distance between the minute and hour hands is the angle, and that distance has to be positive.\\n\\nThe last requirement is that we take the smaller of the two resulting angles:\\nMIN (L, 360 - L)\\n\\nSo, in code:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n#define M(m) 6 *m\\n#define H_base(h) h * 30\\n#define H_offset(m) (double)m / 2\\n#define H(h, m) H_base(h) + H_offset(m)\\npublic:\\n    double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {\\n\\t\\tdouble M = M(minutes);\\n\\t\\tdouble H = H(hour, minutes);\\n\\t\\tdouble L = abs(M - H);\\n\\t\\treturn min(L, 360 - L);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n### Below are unnecessary optimizations, especially considering that this problem is \\'locked\\' now. I also assume the reader\\'s familiarity with algebra and C/C++\\nI considered two optimizations, both based on refactoring the expression, abs(M - H), which expands to: \\n```\\n\\tabs( 6 * minutes - (30 * hour + (minutes / 2) ) );\\n```\\nWith some algebra, we can bring the arithmetic operations down to 1 SUB and 2 MULT (the compiler knows to make (double)11/2 a constant. To skip the explicit cast, you can write it as a literal, 5.5):\\n```\\n    double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {\\n\\t\\tdouble L = abs(5.5*minutes - 30.0*hour);\\n\\t\\treturn L > 180 ? 360 - L : L;\\n\\t}\\n```\\nWhile this alone might seem like the most optimal solution, the corresponding assembler output (clang++-9, -O1) will show many conversions and move operations that exist just because the abs function takes a double instead of an integer. So, maybe we can do better by refactoring the abs(M-H) expression so that M-H remains an integer? Yes:\\n```\\n\\tdouble L = abs(11*minutes - 60*hour) * 0.5;\\n```\\nEven further, we can keep the result of abs as an int and delay the conversion to a double (that happens when multiplying by 0.5) until after the final conditional statement:\\n```\\n        int L = abs(11*minutes - 60*hour);\\n        return (L > 360 ? 720 - L : L) * 0.5;\\n```\\nIn order to allow the L * 0.5 expression to become the function\\'s last instructions, we double the constants, 180 and 360, to return the correct values. If you looked at the compiler output, you would\\'ve been able to see that the constants 180 and 360 had to be moved into XMM registers to compare against L when it was a double. Now that L is an int, the new constants (360 and 720) are immediate operands to the instructions. Here is a CE link to a comparison of this change: https://godbolt.org/z/YMWWaz\\n\\nBasically, the premise of the optimizations comes from a general rule to minimize data conversions.\\n# Optimized Solution:\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {\\n        int L = abs(11*minutes - 60*hour);\\n        return (L > 360 ? 720 - L : L) * 0.5;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "Explanation: For the hours, you have 12 different values. For the minutes you have 60 different values. You can then divide 360 degrees into 12 parts for the hours (result is 30), and divide 360 degrees into 60 parts for the minutes (result: 6).\\n\\nNow you can easily calculate how many degrees there are between the beginning of each pointer and their current position. For the hours it would be `30*hours` and for the minutes it would be `6*minutes`. But be careful! The hour pointer can be anywhere between the current and the next hour, so you can\\'t just take the hours value, you need to use the minutes to calculate where, in between the current and the next hour, the pointer is. You do that by using `30 * (hours + minutes/60)`.\\n\\nNow, in order to calculate the angle between, you take the difference between the two calculated degrees. Beware that the result can be negative, as you won\\'t know which pointer is ahead of the other, so you take the absolute value of that difference. Also, you do not know if you calculated the bigger or the smaller angle, so you do take the minimum between the calculated angle and its complement: `min(calculated,360-calculated)`.\\n\\nThe formula can then be worked.\\n1. `| 6minutes - 30 * (hours + minutes/60) |`\\n2. `| 6minutes - 30hours - 30minutes/60 |`\\n3. `| 6minutes - 30hours - minutes/2 |`\\n4. `| 12minutes/2 - 60hours/2 - minutes/2 |`\\n5. `| 11minutes/2 - 60hours/2 |`\\n6. `| (11minutes - 60hours)/2 |`\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {\\n        double a = Math.abs((11*minutes - 60*hour)/2.0);\\n        return Math.min(a,360-a);\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

There are a couple catches here.\\n\\n1. if we start from 0, the minutes never go above 60. But the hours can be actually above 12 (like if we get 12:59 - that\\'s almost 1:00), so we need to add minutes to the hours:\\n\\n```\\n        h,m = (360*(hour+minutes/60)/12) % 360 , (360*minutes/60) \\n```\\n\\nThe hours can go from 0:00 - that\\'s 0 to 12:00 - that\\'s 360 and even higher to 12:59 - that\\'s above 360. So if our hour angle goes above 360 - we need to bring reduce it by 360, that\\'s done by `% 360`\\n\\n3. The angle between the arrows can\\'t be more than 180, so we need to find the diff. We do it in two steps:\\n\\n```\\n        d = abs(h-m)\\n\\t\\treturn d if d<180 else 360 - d\\n```\\n\\nThat looks somewhat random, but there is meaning to it. The angle between arrows is relative and can be measured in two ways - clockwise and counterclockwise. One if those angles is going to be <=180, another one is >=180 . So we need to pick the smaller angle regardless of the direction. The first `abs()` call basically means we don\\'t care if the angle is measured clockwise or counterwise. And the 2nd `if` statement says that we need to pick the smaller one.\\n\\nOk, so where is the one-liner? Here you go, the same code, just re-packaged:\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def angleClock(self, hour: int, minutes: int) -> float:\\n        return d if (d := abs(30*(hour+minutes/60) % 360 - 6*minutes)) <180 else 360 - d\\n ```\\n",

By doing that it motivate\\'s me to create more better post like this \\u270D\\uFE0F\\n\\n**So Ladies n Gentlemen without any further due let\\'s start,**\\n```\\nLet\\'s understood with an example - [100,-23,-23,404,100,23,23,23,3,404] and using this example we create a map. \\nWhere Key is the number present and the value as an the index in which it is present. \\nSo, we would get something like this:\\n```\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/262653d1-38ec-4dd0-8671-d71b6bf8892b_1642214744.1664274.png)\\n\\n\\nAs we see the key is **100** and value part **0,4** which would give us the **indexes** where this **value** is found. So, that whenever we want to jump we can found at **4 index** also we have **100** we can **jump directly** on that apart from going to **i + 1, i - 1**. So, now with that will take a **queue**, where we will going to store the element that we are going to process at each step. \\nSince we are **positioned at index 0** will **add 0** in the **queue** and the steps would be **0** as we have not taken any of these steps till now. Now from here we can go to different places.\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/8c3fd5c3-0490-45e8-80d1-555ca905f1ef_1642215457.224442.png)\\n\\nTo state all the possible jumps at each step. I had **marked a vertical line** in the **queue**. So, **starting is 0** from here we can jump to some other steps. \\nSo, now in the first step we can jump to `idx - 1, idx + 1 or values in map`. Which gives us **-1, 1** & the value in map **0, 4**. In this one **0** is **current index** and **4th** one is this **100**.\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/53996ad6-d5e1-4077-a443-06e07fb508a7_1642216339.8178186.png)\\n\\nFrom these **-1 & 0** are not reachable & we can just reach to **1 & 4**. We put these in the **queue**. And that line mark the end of the position we can reach in **1st step**. Now we had already process the **100** we will **removing** from the **map**. So, that we do not process this again, there will be cases where we can get a **tle** if we keep the processes index in map for **example** if all these are **100**. We\\'ll keep on processing the **i - 1 i + 1 i - 1 i + 1** and every other index **multiple** no of times and we\\'ll get a **tle**. So, for that reason we are just **removing** from our **map**.\\n\\nNow, in this we know that in the first step we can reach to **1 & 4**. So, in the **next step** where can we reach. So we will be **popping** the element out of **queue and calculating jumps** from that particular index.\\nSo, for that since we are calculating **2nd step**. We do `step = step + 1` and we find the step from the 1st index which is **-23** : **we can go to 0 or 2 or 1 but 0 & 1 are not reachable**. So, we will add **2** in the **queue**.\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/aa94f3db-e4b5-4c89-97f2-b4076f4443ed_1642218629.943465.png)\\n\\n\\nNow we will again **remove -23 from our Map**.\\nNext we will go to **4th index**. So, from **4th index** we can go to **-1, +1** & we could have also gone to **index 0** but since **100** is not **present** in **map**. We couldn\\'t be going to 100 or 0 sice it is already remove from the map. So here will add **5 & 3 in our queue**. Now we have already got places where we can jump in **2**. We are finding where will be ending up in **step 3**. Will do a `step++` and start processing our indexes.\\n\\n**From 2 we can reach to 3**. So, we **add 3**. But from **5 we can reach to 6 & 7** so we add these two. And from **3 we can reach to 9**. Now here we can see **9 is indeed our last index**. So, here we will be `returning 3`.\\nWhich is minimum step we would be needed to reach the index 9 or last index. So, we return 3.\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/04238d68-3276-4a69-acc6-750a05c43a73_1642218510.5799263.png)\\n\\n**Now let\\'s code it up** \\n\\n*code each line explained*\\n\\n* Step 1 :\\n```\\n{\\n        // creating variable\\n        int n = arr.length;\\n        if(n == 1) return 0; // base case\\n        \\n        // craeted map holding integer & list\\n        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();\\n        int step = 0; // intial step is 0\\n        \\n        // Our 1st job is \"fill the map\"\\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){\\n            // so, using this function it will check is arr[i] is present or not, if it\\'s not present it would create a new arraylist\\n            // and if it\\'s already present we will add index in it\\n            map.computeIfAbsent(arr[i], v -> new ArrayList()).add(i);\\n        }\\n```\\n\\n* Step 2 :\\n```\\n// next we need a queue.\\n        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();\\n        q.offer(0);// in queue we will add our 1st index which is 0;\\n        \\n        while(!q.isEmpty()){ // looping until queue is not empty\\n            step++; // incrementing our step\\n            int size = q.size(); // taking queue size\\n            for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){ // now for each element in this queue for this particulart size running a loop\\n                // so, here we will perform 3 steps\\n                int j = q.poll(); // getting element from queue\\n                \\n                // Jump to j - 1\\n                if(j - 1 >= 0 && map.containsKey(arr[j - 1])){\\n                    q.offer(j - 1);\\n                }\\n                \\n                // Jump to j + 1\\n                if(j + 1 < n && map.containsKey(arr[j + 1])){\\n                    // there could be 2 conditions\\n                    if(j + 1 == n - 1) return step; // if j+1 is equals to last element\\n                    q.offer(j + 1); // otherwise add in queue\\n                }\\n                \\n                // Jump to k --> arr[j] == arr[k]\\n                if(map.containsKey(arr[j])){ // if this particular element hasn\\'t processed\\n                    for(int k : map.get(arr[j])){ // so, we will iterate over each k\\n                        if(k != j){ // in this we first check if they are not equal, positions are not same\\n                            if(k == n - 1) return step;\\n                            q.offer(k);\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                map.remove(arr[j]); // removing from map\\n            }\\n        }\\n```\\n\\n* Final Step :\\n```\\nreturn step;\\n```\\n\\n**Java**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int minJumps(int[] arr) {\\n        int n = arr.length;\\n        \\n        if(n == 1) return 0;\\n        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();\\n        int step = 0;\\n        \\n        // fill the map\\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){\\n            map.computeIfAbsent(arr[i], v -> new ArrayList()).add(i);\\n        }\\n        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();\\n        q.offer(0);\\n        \\n        while(!q.isEmpty()){\\n            step++;\\n            int size = q.size();\\n            for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){\\n                int j = q.poll();\\n            \\n                if(j - 1 >= 0 && map.containsKey(arr[j - 1])){\\n                    q.offer(j - 1);\\n                }\\n\\n                if(j + 1 < n && map.containsKey(arr[j + 1])){\\n                    if(j + 1 == n - 1) return step;\\n                    q.offer(j + 1);\\n                }\\n\\n                if(map.containsKey(arr[j])){\\n                    for(int k : map.get(arr[j])){\\n                        if(k != j){\\n                            if(k == n - 1) return step;\\n                            q.offer(k);\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                map.remove(arr[j]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return step;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nANALYSIS :-\\n* **Time Complexity :-** BigO(N)\\n\\n* **Space Complexity :-** BigO(N)\\n\\nIf you have some \\uD83E\\uDD14 doubts feel free to bug me anytime or If you understood than don\\'t forget to upvote \\uD83D\\uDC4D",

And it goes like this:\\n```\\nunordered_map<int, vector<int>> mp;\\n    vector<bool> visit;\\n    int rec(vector<int>& arr, int start, vector<bool>& visit){\\n        if(start <0 || start > arr.size()-1) return 1000000; //out of range \\n        if(visit[start]==true) return 1000000; //already wisited in a node\\n        if(start == arr.size()-1) return 0; //base case when we reach the last index\\n        int step = 1000000; \\n        visit[start]=true; //marking as visited \\n        step = min(step, 1+rec(arr, start+1, visit));  //recurse on i+1\\n        step = min(step, 1+rec(arr, start-1, visit));  //recurse on i-1\\n        for(int i =0;i<mp[arr[start]].size(); i++){   //recurse on a[i]==a[j] & i!=j\\n          if(mp[arr[start]][i] != start)  step = min(step, 1+ rec(arr, mp[arr[start]][i], visit));   \\n        }\\n        visit[start] = false;  //unmarking as visited when done\\n        return step; \\n     }\\n    \\n    int minJumps(vector<int>& arr) {\\n        visit.resize(arr.size(), false);\\n        for(int i =0; i<arr.size(); i++){\\n            mp[arr[i]].push_back(i);  //use array to store a[i]==a[j]\\n        }\\n        return rec(arr, 0, visit);\\n        \\n    }\\n```\\n\\n1. Brute-force : So here we try all nodes that are possible to be jumped. Also, we are using visited array but we are unmarking the node as unvisited after it has been traverse in a path. This is done so that if we we dont unmark it, and we traverse a longer path before, then on traversing a relatively shorter path having any common node , will break the dfs traversal. This is called backtracking. Where we are undoing what was done.\\n\\nThis solves our one problem of not marking any node which as visited if it could be used in any other path too. **When a node is common in multiple paths, we mark and then unmark it visited.**\\n\\n2. Using DP : Next, this solution give us correct answer, but computes path which are common in various paths. There re-computation is involved. To solve this, we can think of memoization (dp), to store the computed paths.\\n\\nAlthough, this seems at first like it would work, but think of the where we traversed a path via  node x. Lets, dp[x] will store the min path from x to last index. Then when we are done with this path, we backtrack and release node x. Then, we might have some path via node x, which follows another path form node x to last index and is actually shorter, but because we have already stored some value in dp[x], we get wrong value.\\n\\nExplained in below fig:\\n[100,-23,-23,404,100,23,23,23,3,404]\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/cfdbd13a-0505-47c5-956b-22fda8677df8_1625434352.598207.png)\\n\\n\\nYellow path -> correct ans\\nRed path -> path 1 , that we traversed first\\nblack path -> path 2 , traversed next\\nHere, we traversed node node 4 (arr[4] = 100) in red path first, and we get the value of path from node 4 to last node 9 as dp[4] = 4. (From node 4 , node 3 is already marked visited, so node 4 has just this path of length 4 )\\nNext we traversed path black, and node 4 has already value stored dp[4] = 4 , so our min path is not correctly calculated.\\nTherefore, there are multiple paths to reach last index from node 4, and also to reach node 4 , therefore, the dp[4] may not be the minimum value;\\n\\n\\n### **Conclusion** :\\n\\nSo, we tried solving below problems:\\n1.) **Multiple paths with common node** : Used backtracking to mark and unmark the node.\\n\\t\\tIts a bruteforce, will give TLE.\\n2.) **Multiple paths from node x to last index** : Used dp[x] to store computed value for a node x in a path. Will not work, as stored value may not be the min value. WA\\n\\nHence, Dfs will not work. as we have end up tracking multiple paths from that stop and considering the minimum.

Actually, bfs is almost sufficient here, but we need to do one optimization which increase our speed dramatically.\\n\\n1. Let us use `d`: defaultdict, where for each value we keep list of all possible indexes for this value. We need this to make fast steps of type 3.\\n2. Let `visited` be as usual set of visited nodes, we need it in usual bfs, not to visit any node two times.\\n3. Let `visited_groups` be set of visited **values**: we need it for the following reason. Imagine, we have `arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`. Then first time we see `1`, we visit all other `1`. Second time we see `1`, we do not need to check its neibors of type `3`, we already know that we visited them. Without this optimization time complexity can be potentially `O(n^2)`.\\n4. What we do next is classical **bfs**: we extract node from queue, visit two neibors of types `1` and `2` and if we did not visit value of this node yet, we visit its all neibors of type `3`.\\n\\n**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`: we visit every index only once and try to visit every node no more than `3` times: for each type of neighbors. Space complexity is `O(n)` as well: to keep `visited` and `visited_groups` sets.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def minJumps(self, arr):\\n        n = len(arr)\\n        d = defaultdict(list)\\n        for i, num in enumerate(arr):\\n            d[num].append(i)\\n            \\n        queue = deque([(0, 0)])\\n        visited, visited_groups = set(), set()\\n        \\n        while queue:\\n            steps, index = queue.popleft()\\n            if index == n - 1: return steps\\n            \\n            for neib in [index - 1, index + 1]:\\n                if 0 <= neib < n and neib not in visited:\\n                    visited.add(neib)\\n                    queue.append((steps + 1, neib))\\n            \\n            if arr[index] not in visited_groups:\\n                for neib in d[arr[index]]:\\n                    if neib not in visited:\\n                        visited.add(neib)\\n                        queue.append((steps + 1, neib))\\n                visited_groups.add(arr[index])\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Starting from the first index, we can visit all the neighbouring indices and add them to a queue. We can then repeat this process for all the indices in the queue until we reach the last index. To efficiently find the neighboring indices, we can use an HashMap to store the indices of each value in the List. This allows us to easily find the neighbouring indices of a given index using the values at that index. We can mark the visited indices to avoid visiting them again and keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each index. Once we reach the last index, we can return the number of steps taken to reach it. If we cannot reach the last index, we can return -1 to indicate that it is not possible to reach the last index.\\nExplanation credits :- https://leetcode.com/singhabhinash/\\nLink of explanation :- https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-iv/discuss/3257846/Day-64-oror-BFS-oror-O(n)-time-and-O(n)-space-oror-Easiest-Beginner-Friendly-Sol**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int minJumps(int[] arr) {\\n        int steps=0;\\n        int  n=arr.length;\\n        HashMap<Integer,List<Integer>> hm=new HashMap<>();\\n        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){\\n            if(!hm.containsKey(arr[i])){\\n                List<Integer> temp =new ArrayList<>();\\n                temp.add(i);\\n                hm.put(arr[i],temp);\\n            }\\n            else{\\n                List<Integer> temp=hm.get(arr[i]);\\n                temp.add(i);\\n                hm.put(arr[i],temp);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        boolean vis[]=new boolean[n];\\n        vis[0]=true;\\n        Queue<Integer> qu=new LinkedList<>();\\n        qu.add(0);\\n        while(!qu.isEmpty()){\\n            int size=qu.size();\\n            for(int i=0;i<size;i++){\\n                int curridx=qu.poll();\\n                if(curridx==n-1)\\n                    return steps;\\n                List<Integer> jumptoindexes=hm.get(arr[curridx]);\\n                jumptoindexes.add(curridx+1);\\n                jumptoindexes.add(curridx-1);\\n                for(int q:jumptoindexes){\\n                    if(q>=0 && q<n && !vis[q]){\\n                        vis[q]=true;\\n                        qu.add(q);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                jumptoindexes.clear();\\n            }\\n            steps++;\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/28b6d959-485e-4322-820e-f53989be39f8_1677982432.0934901.jpeg)\\n",

If we can reach the last index in one of these jumps, we can return the number of jumps. However, we might need to take jumps to indices we have already visited before, so we need to keep track of visited indices to avoid infinite loops.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Create a dictionary to store the indices of each value in the array.\\n2. Use a queue to perform a breadth-first search of the indices.\\n3. For each index in the queue, add the indices corresponding to the adjacent values in the\\ndictionary and to the left and right of the current index.\\n4.

If the queue is emptied and the last index is not reached, return -1 to indicate that it is\\nnot possible to reach the last index.\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: The worst-case time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the array. In the worst case, we might need to visit all the indices in the array to reach the last index.\\n\\n- Space complexity: The space complexity is also $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the array.

And loop through the array and add each index to the list of indices for its corresponding value in the map:\\n```\\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) \\n{\\n  // Add the current index to the list of indices for its corresponding value\\n  graph.putIfAbsent(arr[i], new ArrayList<>());\\n  graph.get(arr[i]).add(i);\\n}\\n\\n```\\n***\\u27A1\\uFE0FStep 3: BFS Algorithm***\\n- Now, in this step enter a loop that performs a BFS algorithm to find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of the array.\\n-  At each iteration of the loop, dequeue the next node from the queue, check if it\\'s the last index of the array, and mark it as visited.\\n-  Then add the adjacent nodes to the list of indices for their corresponding value in the map, and enqueue any adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet:\\n```\\nfor (int steps = 0; !q.isEmpty(); ++steps) \\n{\\n  // Iterate over all the nodes at the current level of the BFS\\n  for (int sz = q.size(); sz > 0; --sz) \\n  {\\n    // Dequeue the next node and check if it\\'s the last index of the array\\n    final int i = q.poll();\\n    if (i == n - 1)\\n      return steps;\\n    seen[i] = true;\\n    final int u = arr[i];\\n    // Add the adjacent nodes to the list of indices for their corresponding value\\n    if (i + 1 < n)\\n      graph.get(u).add(i + 1);\\n    if (i - 1 >= 0)\\n      graph.get(u).add(i - 1);\\n    // Iterate over all the adjacent nodes and enqueue them if they haven\\'t been seen yet\\n    for (final int v : graph.get(u)) \\n    {\\n      if (seen[v])\\n        continue;\\n      q.offer(v);\\n    }\\n    // Clear the list of indices for the current node value to avoid revisiting it\\n    graph.get(u).clear();\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n***\\u27A1\\uFE0FStep 4: Return the minimum number of jumps***\\n- If the end of the array is reached, return the number of steps it took to get there.

Here we are using BFS Algorithm. \\nThen the immediate question is why???? \\n\\n**Reason**\\n\\n**Whenever there is an unwieghted graph and we want to retrive the shortest path or minimum steps to reach the destination** , we use **BFS**  , **as it takes all the neighbouring guys from the current node and this process repeats for every node** .\\n\\n**Thus the total visualisation will be like we are generating hotspots/ rainbows on each node.

We keep track of the visited indices to avoid revisiting the same indices again, and we also maintain a queue to keep track of the indices that need to be explored in the next step.\\n\\n\\n# Approach\\nFor each index, we explore three possible jumps:\\n\\ni + 1, where i + 1 < arr.length\\ni - 1, where i - 1 >= 0\\nj where arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j\\n\\nIf any of the next indices haven\\'t been visited before, we mark them as visited and add them to the queue. We repeat this process until we reach the last index of the array or until there are no more indices to explore in the queue.\\n\\nThe minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array is the number of steps required to reach the last index from the first index, which is the number of levels in the BFS tree.\\n\\nTherefore, the intuition behind this approach is to explore all the possible jumps from each index of the array in a breadth-first manner until we reach the last index, and we maintain a count of the number of steps required to reach the last index.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time complexity of the BFS algorithm used to solve this problem is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we visit each element of the array exactly once, and for each element, we explore at most three possible jumps.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity of the algorithm is also O(n), as we need to store the visited array of size n and the queue of size at most n, which can happen in the worst case when all elements have the same value.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int minJumps(vector<int>& arr) {\\n        int n = arr.size();\\n        if (n == 1) return 0;\\n        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> indices;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            indices[arr[i]].push_back(i);\\n        }\\n        vector<int> visited(n);\\n        visited[0] = true;\\n        queue<int> q;\\n        q.push(0);\\n        int steps = 0;\\n        while (!q.empty()) {\\n            int size = q.size();\\n            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\\n                int curr = q.front();\\n                q.pop();\\n                if (curr == n - 1) return steps;\\n                if (curr + 1 < n && !visited[curr + 1]) {\\n                    visited[curr + 1] = true;\\n                    q.push(curr + 1);\\n                }\\n                if (curr - 1 >= 0 && !visited[curr - 1]) {\\n                    visited[curr - 1] = true;\\n                    q.push(curr - 1);\\n                }\\n                for (int nextIndex : indices[arr[curr]]) {\\n                    if (nextIndex != curr && !visited[nextIndex]) {\\n                        visited[nextIndex] = true;\\n                        q.push(nextIndex);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                indices[arr[curr]].clear();\\n            }\\n            steps++;\\n        }\\n        return -1;\\n    }\\n};\\n//\\uD83D\\uDC47UPVOTE IF YOU LIKED MY SOLUTION\\n\\n```",

If we take an index of the `arr` as a node, we can see that from that node we can go to `i-1`, `i+1` and to `j` where `arr[i] == arr[j]`. We could build an adjacency list but it\\'s not necessary because `i-1` and `i+1` can be calculated from the index. The only thing we need is a hashmap `groups` with the list of elements where we can jump directly from the current element.\\n\\nWhen the hashmap is ready, we can traverse the graph level by level using standard BFS and find the shortest distance to the last element. There is one catch here though. It\\'s not enough to keep a set of visited nodes. For example, this array `[7,7,7,7,7,7,7 .......,11]` with max number of elements will give us a TME since we have to visit 7s on every iteration which will give us an `O(n^2)` complexity. We need to ignore such groups after we visited them once. That is why we have another set for visited groups along with the set of visited nodes.\\n\\nTime: **O(E+V)** - BFS\\nSpace: **O(n)** - hashmap\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def minJumps(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:\\n        N, groups = len(arr), defaultdict(list)\\n\\n        for i, el in enumerate(arr): \\n            groups[el].append(i)\\n\\n        vis, vis_groups = set(), set()\\n        \\n        def bfs(lvl, dist):\\n            nextLvl = set()\\n            \\n            for i in lvl:\\n                if i in vis: continue\\n                if i == N-1: return dist\\n                \\n                vis.add(i)\\n                \\n                if i: nextLvl.add(i-1)\\n                if i+1 < N: nextLvl.add(i+1)\\n                \\n                if not arr[i] in vis_groups:\\n                    vis_groups.add(arr[i])\\n                    nextLvl.update(groups[arr[i]])\\n            \\n            return bfs(nextLvl, dist + 1)\\n            \\n        return bfs(set([0]), 0)\\n```\\n\\n**UPVOTE if you like (\\uD83C\\uDF38\\u25E0\\u203F\\u25E0), If you have any question, feel free to ask.**",

                "content": "UPDATE March 2023:  The test cases for this leetcode problem have changed, so that this code is now much slower, with a runtime of 1500ms.  In many leetcode problems, when passed an arrays, it is frequently assumed that the arrays will be processed from low-index start to high-index end.  The test cases contain a few test cases that are frequently designed to be difficult when processed from start to end, but usually no test cases that are difficult when processed backward, from end back to start.  After this code was faster than all other code on the runtime graph, someone added test case(s) that are difficult when processing the passed array from end to start.  This has happened in multiple other leetcode problems, where I had code that was very fast when processing arrays backward.  I\\'m glad people have added more robust test cases, even though some of my very fast code now runs much slower.  In one case, someone added new test cases that are difficult when processing the array from end back to start, so I changed my code to process the array from center outward very quickly.  Then someone added difficult test cases when processing the array from the center outward.  It is good to find leetcoders that can create test cases that fill these processing gaps, and be more difficult for more types of algorithms.\\n\\nORIGINAL Januaray 2022:\\nThe Java code below runs as fast as 23ms on 2022-01-15.  The next fastest entry on the graph at this date was 33ms.  Clicking the \"Submit\" button in a leetcode problem multiple times, can result in different runtimes for each submit.  The code below had runtimes from 23ms to 91ms.  Runtimes may also change when leetcode adds new test cases in the future.\\n\\nFor leetcode problem #1345 \"Jump Game IV\":  The code below uses a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm.  A BFS algorithm usually searches layer-by-layer from a defined starting point, until the goal of the search is found.  The code below starts at a pre-defined index in the array `arr[]`.  All possible valid moves from that pre-defined index in `arr[]`, are saved as indexes in the next \"layer\" of the search.  Then the BFS uses all the indexes from that saved layer, to try all possible valid moves from those indexes, and save those indexes in a new layer.  The BFS advances the search layer by layer, until reaching the end of the search.\\n\\nThe code below is optimized for speed.  Several optimizations are used to gain speed.  Some of these optimizations are basic to many Breadth First Search implementations.  Some optimizations are specific to this leetcode problem.  Optimizations are:\\n\\n**Search backward:**  This leetcode problem discussion says to start at index 0 and find the minimum number of valid moves to \"jump\" to index `arr.length-1`.  The rules of \"jumps\" in this problem are symmetric, so that the answer will be the same using going from start to end, or from end to start.  The code below uses the Breadth First Search going from the end-point of the game (the last index in the array; `arr[arr.length-1]`) backward to the start-point in the game (index zero; `arr[0]`). In leetcode problems, when processing can be done either from start to end, or from end to start, it is frequently faster to process backward.  Processing backward in leetcode problems is usually faster because of the test cases that were designed to be difficult for most problem code.  However some test cases are faster when processed backward.  This leetcode problem has been faster processing in the backward direction.  Therefore the code below starts the BFS at `arr[arr.length-1]` and jumps to `arr[0]`.\\n\\nIn some problems with known start-point and end-point of a Breadth First Search (BFS), it is faster to start a BFS from each end and have the two Breadth First Searches meet in the middle.  This method can be faster when the BFS tree will spread wider and wider for each layer.  By starting at each end and working toward the middle, the BFS trees don\\'t spread as wide and there may be fewer nodes to search.  However, in this leetcode problem, searching from both end toward the middle was slightly slower in my implementation.\\n\\n**Ignore interior values of repeated consecutive values:**  In the passed `arr[]` array, if the same value is repeated multiple times in a row, then only the first and last value of that repeated value are significant for the \"Jump Game IV\" rules.  For example, if\\n ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` `arr[] = [1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,4,8,8,7,8]`\\nthen values in `arr[]` can be handled as:\\n ` ` ` ` ` ` ` ` `arr[] = [1,8,*,*,*,*,8,1,4,8,8,7,8]`\\nwhere \"\\\\*\" represents a value that can be ignored for this game.  This is because of the definition of the jump rules.  If we jumped to the first \"8\" at index 1, then there would be no reason to set to index 1+1 when we could jump directly to any other \"8\" and have fewer jumps.\\n \\nThe code below creates a HashMap so that any value in `arr[]` can be looked-up in the HashMap to get a List of all indexes where that same value occurs in `arr[]`.  For example, the HashMap entry for \"1\" would contain the list `{0,7}`.  The HashMap entry for \"8\" would contain the list `{1,6,9,10,12}`.  The \"8\"s at index 2 through 5, the \"\\\\*\"s in the example above, are not saved in this list because they could NOT be on the minimum path in this game.  Ignoring the interior values of repeated consecutive values keep these lists shorter and runtime faster.\\n \\nA test case for this leetcode problem has over 49_000 consecutive \"7\"s.  By ignoring interior values of multiply repeated values in a row, this reduces the HashMap list for \"7\" from over 49_000 indexes to be processes, to a list length of only two \"7\"s to be processed.\\n \\n**Don\\'t reallocate Arrays:**  In the code below, the Breadth First Search (BFS) uses Arrays of `int` to contain the indexes for each layer of the BFS.  The BFS has one array for the current indexes to start a jump from, and another array being filled with the next layer of indexes jumped to.  When the array of current indexes has been fully processed, the two arrays are swapped, which saves the time of deallocating an old array and allocating a new array of the same length.\\n \\nIn Java, an array variable is only a reference, or a pointer, to the array data allocated in memory.  In the following pseudo-code fragment, the process of swapping which array data the variables `curLayer` and `nextLayer` are referencing is shown with the variable name on the left, and lines pointing to which allocated data they are referencing or pointing to.  A temporary variable is used to help swap which data goes with the array variables.  Sorry for the crude text graphics.\\n ```\\n         int[] curLayer ----------> {...array #1...}\\n         int[] nextLayer ---------> {...array #2...}\\ntmpLayer = curLayer;\\n         int[] tmpLayer ------------v\\n         int[] curLayer ----------> {...array #1...}\\n         int[] nextLayer ---------> {...array #2...}\\ncurLayer = nextLayer;\\n         int[] tmpLayer ----------> {...array #1...}\\n         int[] curLayer ------------v\\n         int[] nextLayer ---------> {...array #2...}\\nnextLayer = tmpLayer;\\n                             /----> {...array #1...}\\n         int[] curLayer ----(--\\\\\\n         int[] nextLayer --/    \\\\-> {...array #2...}\\n ```\\n**Use Arrays of primitive type instead of Lists for BFS layers:**  Arrays of primitive types such as `int`, `long`, `boolean`, `byte`, etc. are usually faster runtime than using List or other Collection data types, and are also faster than Arrays of objects such as `Integer`, `Long`, `Boolean`, `Byte`, etc.  Arrays are used in the code below to hold the layers of the Breadth First Search (BFS).  Arrays can be used because the maximum possible length needed for these arrays is known and is not extremely large.  In cases where the maximum possible length is unknown or is extremely large, a List would be better.  This is because an Array\\'s size can NOT be changed, while a List will expand in size as needed.\\n \\n The use of Arrays in the code below was a choice for optimizing for speed.  But Lists would be better for readability, maintaining code, simplifying code, and generally are considered a better programming practice.  In real-world programming, if the requirements have limits on runtime or memory size, Arrays and less readable code may be needed.  These types of speed and memory requirements often happen in real-time and embedded programming, and in some frequently called low-level run-time routines.\\n \\n\\n**If useful, please upvote.**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int minJumps(int[] arr) {\\n        int len = arr.length;\\n        if (len <= 1)  return 0;\\n        if (arr[0] == arr[len - 1])  return 1;\\n\\n        // Put all arr[] values in a HashMap so we can find matching values faster.\\n        HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>> map = new HashMap();\\n        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();\\n        list.add(0);\\n        map.put(arr[0], list);              // Add arr[0] to the HashMap.\\n        list = new ArrayList<Integer>();\\n        list.add(len - 1);\\n        map.put(arr[len - 1], list);        // Add arr[len - 1] to the HashMap.\\n        // Loop to add arr[1..len-2] to HashMap.\\n        for (int i = 1; i < len - 1; i++) { \\n            list = map.get(arr[i]);\\n            if (list == null) {             // If arr[i] not yet in HashMap...\\n                list = new ArrayList<Integer>();\\n                map.put(arr[i], list);\\n            }\\n            // Add arr[i] to the HashMap only if arr[i] is a different value from \\n            // arr[i-1] or arr[i+1].

This type of algorithm searches for a solution by exploring neighboring nodes before moving on to the next layer of nodes (step). The goal of this algorithm is to find the shortest path from the starting node to the destination node.\\n\\n# Approach\\nI used a Map to store the index of each element in the array, and then used a Set to keep track of the indexes that have already been checked. I performed a BFS traversal of the array, starting from the last element, and going towards the beginning. I used the Map to check if the current element had any jumps associated with it and add those indexes to the Set of next indexes to be checked. I also added the adjacent indexes to the Set of next indexes to be checked. Finally, I incremented the step count each time I traversed the array.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n/**\\n * @param {number[]} arr\\n * @return {number}\\n */\\nvar minJumps = function (arr) {\\n    const targetIndex = arr.length - 1;\\n    if (targetIndex < 1) return 0;\\n\\n    const map = new Map();\\n    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\\n        if (!map.has(arr[i])) map.set(arr[i], []);\\n        map.get(arr[i]).push(i);\\n    }\\n\\n    let checkedIndexes = new Set();\\n    let stepCount = 0;\\n    let currentStepIndexes = new Set();\\n    currentStepIndexes.add(targetIndex);\\n    // from right to left. end to start. arr.length - 1 to 0\\n    while (currentStepIndexes.size > 0) {\\n        let nextStepIndexes = new Set();\\n        for (const currentStepIndex of currentStepIndexes.values()) {\\n            checkedIndexes.add(currentStepIndex);\\n\\n            if (currentStepIndex == 0) return stepCount;\\n            // -1\\n            if (currentStepIndex > 0 && !checkedIndexes.has(currentStepIndex - 1)) {\\n                if ((currentStepIndex - 1) == 0) return ++stepCount;\\n                nextStepIndexes.add(currentStepIndex - 1);\\n            }\\n            // jumps\\n            const jumps = map.get(arr[currentStepIndex]);\\n            if (jumps) {\\n                map.delete(arr[currentStepIndex]);\\n                let limit = 0;\\n                for (const jumpIndex of jumps) {\\n                    if (jumpIndex !== currentStepIndex && !checkedIndexes.has(jumpIndex)) {\\n                        limit++;\\n                        if (limit > 5) break;\\n                        if (jumpIndex == 0) return ++stepCount;\\n                        nextStepIndexes.add(jumpIndex);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n            // +1\\n            if (currentStepIndex < targetIndex && !checkedIndexes.has(currentStepIndex + 1)) {\\n                nextStepIndexes.add(currentStepIndex + 1);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        currentStepIndexes = nextStepIndexes;\\n        stepCount++;\\n    }\\n    return stepCount;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**If my work was useful for you, please upvote!**\\n\\n\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83D\\uDC4D",

Then, we perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from index 0 to find the shortest path to the last index, where each step corresponds to a jump.\\n\\n# Approach\\nIn this implementation, we use a Map object to represent the graph, a jumps array to keep track of the minimum number of jumps to reach each index, and a queue q to store the indexes to visit. We initialize the jumps array to -1, except for the first index which has a free jump. We also delete the nodes from the graph as we visit them to avoid revisiting them.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n + k log k), where n is the length of the input array and k is the number of distinct values in the array. \\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity is also O(n + k), to store the graph and the jumps array.\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n/**\\n * @param {number[]} arr\\n * @return {number}\\n */\\n\\nvar minJumps = function(arr) {\\n    const n = arr.length;\\n    if (n === 1) return 0; // edge case: only one element, no jumps needed\\n    const jumps = new Array(n).fill(-1); // initialize jumps array to -1\\n    const graph = new Map(); // create a map to represent the graph of connections\\n    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n        if (!graph.has(arr[i])) graph.set(arr[i], []);\\n        graph.get(arr[i]).push(i); // add current index to the list of indexes with the same value\\n    }\\n    const q = [0]; // start BFS from index 0\\n    jumps[0] = 0; // first jump is free\\n    while (q.length > 0) {\\n        const currIndex = q.shift();\\n        const currValue = arr[currIndex];\\n        const neighbors = graph.get(currValue);\\n        if (neighbors) { // add a check for truthy value\\n            for (const neighborIndex of neighbors) {\\n                if (jumps[neighborIndex] === -1) { // if neighbor has not been visited yet\\n                    jumps[neighborIndex] = jumps[currIndex] + 1; // update number of jumps\\n                    q.push(neighborIndex); // add neighbor to the queue\\n                }\\n            }\\n            graph.delete(currValue); // remove current value from the graph to avoid revisiting it\\n        }\\n        if (currIndex - 1 >= 0 && jumps[currIndex - 1] === -1) { // check left neighbor\\n            jumps[currIndex - 1] = jumps[currIndex] + 1; // update number of jumps\\n            q.push(currIndex - 1); // add left neighbor to the queue\\n        }\\n        if (currIndex + 1 < n && jumps[currIndex + 1] === -1) { // check right neighbor\\n            jumps[currIndex + 1] = jumps[currIndex] + 1; // update number of jumps\\n            q.push(currIndex + 1); // add right neighbor to the queue\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return jumps[n - 1]; // return minimum number of jumps to reach the last index\\n};\\n\\n```\\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/67e34a02-d9d5-4376-a343-20c2fad7b455_1678004108.3564777.png)\\n\\n# Please Upvote\\n```\\nThanks for visiting my solution.\\uD83D\\uDE0A Keep Learning\\nPlease give my solution an upvote! \\uD83D\\uDC4D\\nIt\\'s a simple way to show your appreciation and\\nkeep me motivated.

However, in this case, because of the back edges, there is a cycle. Therefore, DP cannot be       used. However , DP can be used but it will not be efficient. \\n**BFS **\\nJust a simple breadth first search, at any index where can you go. \\n    (1).

This problem contains similar approach but we need some additional understanding.\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n\\n# Approach\\nThe question says that at any index i:\\n- we can jump to index $$i-1$$.\\n- we can jump to index $$i+1$$.\\n- or we can jump to those indices that have the same jump value as current index. \\nSuppose given $$jumps = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]$$. We are in index $$i = 0$$ currently. We can go to $$i-1$$ or, $$i+1$$. \\n  -  So, $$i-1 = 0-1 = -1$$. It is out of bound. So, we cannot take it.\\n  - $$i+1 = 0 + 1 = 1$$. We can go to that index.\\n  - You can see from the examples that index $$i = 0$$ has $$jump = 1$$. You can see that indices 1, 3 and 4 also have same value. According to the specification we should also consider those indices.\\n  - So, we can also go to $$i = 3$$ and $$i = 4$$.\\n\\n# Hints:\\nSo, first thing is you have to keep the indices with same jump value.\\nYou probably thinking of a map of list values. The key will be jump length and the values will be indices.\\n\\nWe start from index $$0$$ and we need to keep the **stepsTaken** in a variable. We want the minimum steps. Can we do a **dfs** search in this case? No, **dfs** will go deep into the tree. But for minimum finding case, we should probably use **bfs**. Because **bfs** traverses all the nodes in level order. Gradually from up to bottom. So, we will be good to use **bfs** in this case.\\n\\nWe can see the same indices can come more than once. For this case, we need to keep an array of **boolean** to keep the indices that were visited.\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nUsing **BFS** would take time complexity of $$O(n+k)$$. Here, $$n$$ is the number of elements and the $$k$$ is the maximum edge connecting an element. In worst case, all the elements can be same. But as we are not calculating repeating elements, it is good to go. The time complexity will stay around $$O(n)$$.\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nAs we are keeping a queue and also Clearing it out. There won\\'t be all the $$n$$ elements at one time in the queue. But we have also used an array of **boolean[] visited** which is of size $$n$$. So, the space complexity would be $$O(n)$$.\\n\\n# Code \\n``` java []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int minJumps(int[] arr) {\\n        int len = arr.length;\\n        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();\\n        // storing indices having same jump length..\\n        for(int i=0; i<len; i++){\\n            map.computeIfAbsent(arr[i], x -> new LinkedList<>()).add(i);\\n        }\\n        boolean[] visited = new boolean[len];\\n        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();\\n        q.offer(0);\\n        visited[0] = true;\\n        int stepsTaken = -1;\\n        while(!q.isEmpty()){\\n            int size = q.size();\\n            stepsTaken++;\\n            while(size-->0){\\n                int idx = q.remove();\\n                // we reached the end\\n                if(idx==len-1)\\n                    return stepsTaken;\\n                // get all the indices with same jump length\\n                List<Integer> next = map.get(arr[idx]);\\n                // we can jump to i-1 or i+1\\n                // we don\\'t want to go out of bound...\\n                if(idx-1>=0){\\n                    next.add(idx-1);\\n                }\\n                // we don\\'t want to go out of bound...\\n                if(idx+1<len){\\n                    next.add(idx+1);\\n                }\\n                // iterate for all indices\\n                for(int i : next){\\n                    // we don\\'t want to check the already visited indices again!\\n                    if(!visited[i]){\\n                        visited[i] = true;\\n                        q.offer(i);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                // avoid later lookup sameValueIndicesMap arr[i]\\n                map.get(arr[idx]).clear();\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return 0;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n``` C++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int minJumps(vector<int>& arr) {\\n        int n = arr.size();\\n        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> sameValueIndicesMap;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\\n            sameValueIndicesMap[arr[i]].push_back(i);\\n        vector<bool> visited(n); \\n        queue<int> q; \\n        q.push(0);\\n        visited[0] = true;\\n        int stepsTaken = -1;\\n        while (!q.empty()) {\\n            int size = q.size();\\n            stepsTaken++;\\n            while (size-->0) {\\n                int i = q.front(); \\n                q.pop();\\n                // Reached to last index\\n                if (i == n - 1) {\\n                    return stepsTaken;\\n                }\\n                // get all the indices with same jump length\\n                vector<int>& next = sameValueIndicesMap[arr[i]];\\n                // we can jump to i-1 or i+1\\n                // we don\\'t want to go out of bound...\\n                if(i-1 >=0){\\n                    next.push_back(i - 1);\\n                }\\n                // we don\\'t want to go out of bound...\\n                if(i+1 < n){\\n                    next.push_back(i + 1);\\n                }\\n                // iterate for all indices\\n                for (int j : next) {\\n                    // we don\\'t want to check the already visited indices again!\\n                    if (!visited[j]) {\\n                        visited[j] = true;\\n                        q.push(j);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                // avoid later lookup sameValueIndicesMap arr[i]\\n                next.clear();\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return 0;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/58ea33a3-d47b-44a1-9a1e-7af583173d20_1670178091.0691743.png)\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/0ad03c10-9b0d-4d2c-8451-bb5a171c70ff_1670178117.9879165.png)",

This means we can use a BFS to get the answer quite easily. There are a few things to realize here though.\\n1. The indices of the argument array can be thought of as the vertices in a graph.\\n2. You use the \"rules\" of the game to determine the structure of the graph, as in, how the vertices are connected.\\n3. If there are multiple values in the argument array in a row which are the same (i.e. if arr was {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7}), you technically only need to consider the end-points of this sub-array. That is, you could treat the array as if it was {1, 2, 2, 7} and end up with the same result. Doing this will increase the efficiency of the algorithm in some cases and one of these cases was specifically tested for (final test case).\\n```java\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public int MinJumps(int[] arr) {\\n        if (arr.Length == 1) return 0;        \\n        \\n        // Basic shortest path setup:\\n        int[] d = new int[arr.Length];                                      // Tracks # of jumps from index 0\\n        Dictionary<int, List<int>> vd = new Dictionary<int, List<int>>();   // Maps values to indices\\n        bool[] seen = new bool[arr.Length];                                 // Tracks which indices have been seen\\n        Queue<int> q = new Queue<int>();                                    // BFS queue\\n        \\n        // Initializing \"vd\"\\n        for (int i = 0; i < arr.Length; i++) {\\n            if (!vd.ContainsKey(arr[i])) vd[arr[i]] = new List<int>() { i };\\n            else {\\n                vd[arr[i]].Add(i);\\n                // If there are multiple values that are equal in a row, we only want the endpoints for extra efficiency.\\n                // This is needed to pass the final test case.\\n                while (i < arr.Length - 1 && arr[i] == arr[i + 1]) i++;\\n                if (vd[arr[i]][vd[arr[i]].Count - 1] != i) vd[arr[i]].Add(i);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Setting known values\\n        d[0] = 0;               // # of jumps to index 0 from index 0 is obviously 0\\n        seen[0] = true;         // We\\'ve seen index 0\\n        q.Enqueue(0);           // Queue index 0\\n\\n        while (q.Count > 0) {\\n            int u = q.Dequeue();                                // Dequeue (standard BFS)\\n            foreach (int v in Adj(arr, u, vd))                  // Iterate over \"adjacent vertices\" (indices we can jump to)\\n                if (!seen[v]) {                                 // We only need to consider \"unseen\" vertices\\n                    seen[v] = true;                             // Mark \"vertex\" (index) as seen\\n                    d[v] = 1 + d[u];                            // Record # of jumps from \"source vertex\" (index 0)\\n                    if (v == arr.Length - 1) return d[v];       // As soon as we reach the last index, we are done.\\n                    q.Enqueue(v);                               // Queue up the unseen adjacent \"vertex\" (standard BFS)\\n                }\\n        }\\n        return -1;      // Shouldn\\'t ever return this, since there is always a \"path\" from index 0 to the last index.\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Returns a list of \"adjacent\" vertices, using the rules of the game.\\n    public static List<int> Adj(int[] arr, int i, Dictionary<int, List<int>> valueDict) {\\n        List<int> res = new List<int>();\\n        if (i > 0)res.Add(i - 1);                   // If i > 0, we can jump to the previous index\\n        if (i < arr.Length - 1)res.Add(i + 1);      // If i < arr.Length, we can jump to the next index\\n        \\n        // We can also jump to any index where the values are equal.\\n        valueDict[arr[i]].ForEach(index => { if (index != i) res.Add(index); });\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

(the same better efficiency)\\n****\\n\\nIntuitively, we can solve this task with BFS.\\n\\nWe can see each index as an node of three kinds of search space,\\n1. move backwards(index - 1)\\n2. in place(jump to the index of the same assigned num)\\n3. move forwards(index + 1).\\n\\nTherefore, we need a map first to check where the jumping goes, the connection of nodes.\\n\\nDuring searching, \\nwe can move search level next and next until we find the end node appears in our search level. \\n\\nBFS has a downside, as searching deeper and deeper, \\nthe space of each level will become larger and larger if the end nodes are unlimited. \\nBut in this task, the end node is only one, so the search space will shrink.\\n\\nIn other words, we can ***search forwards or backwards exchangedly***, \\nbecause if we are closed to two end-side, the search space of each level will smaller than in the middle. \\nWe can ***have chance to find all nodes by the connection in smaller space*** of level, not the larger in the middle level. \\nThat will speed search and be faster than normal BFS in some extension. \\n\\n***We only need to check when the search levels of two sides intersect.***\\n\\nCode with clear comments as below.\\nWelcome suggestion, question, comments\\nIf helpful, ***please upvote!

We keep track of the visited indices to avoid revisiting the same indices again, and we also maintain a queue to keep track of the indices that need to be explored in the next step.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nFor each index, we explore three possible jumps:\\n\\ni + 1, where i + 1 < arr.length\\ni - 1, where i - 1 >= 0\\nj where arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j\\n\\nIf any of the next indices haven\\'t been visited before, we mark them as visited and add them to the queue.

The goal is to find the shortest path from the first node to the last node.\\n\\n# Approach\\nFirst, we create a graph where each value in the array maps to a list of indices where that value appears. This allows us to quickly find all indices with the same value as the current index.\\n\\nWe then use breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the first index to the last index. We start by adding the first index to a queue and marking it as visited. Then we iterate through each level of BFS until we reach the last index.\\n\\nAt each level, we iterate through all nodes in the queue and add their neighbors (indices reachable in one step) to the queue if they haven\\u2019t been visited before. We also mark them as visited.\\n\\nTo optimize this solution further, we delete values from our graph once we have processed all indices with that value. This prevents us from processing these indices again in future levels of BFS.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$ since we visit each node once.\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$ since we need to store our graph and visited array.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nfunc minJumps(arr []int) int {\\n    n := len(arr)\\n    if n <= 1 {\\n        return 0\\n    }\\n    graph := make(map[int][]int)\\n    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {\\n        if _, ok := graph[arr[i]]; !ok {\\n            graph[arr[i]] = []int{i}\\n        } else {\\n            graph[arr[i]] = append(graph[arr[i]], i)\\n        }\\n    }\\n    visited := make([]bool, n)\\n    visited[0] = true\\n    queue := []int{0}\\n    step := 0\\n\\n    for len(queue) > 0 {\\n        size := len(queue)\\n        for i := 0; i < size; i++ {\\n            curr := queue[0]\\n            queue = queue[1:]\\n            if curr == n-1 {\\n                return step\\n            }\\n            nexts := append(graph[arr[curr]], curr-1)\\n            nexts = append(nexts, curr+1)\\n\\n            for _, next := range nexts {\\n                if next >= 0 && next < n && !visited[next] {\\n                    visited[next] = true\\n                    queue = append(queue, next)\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            delete(graph, arr[curr])\\n        }\\n        step++\\n    }\\n\\n    return -1\\n}\\n```",

If j is already visited, skip to the next index.  \\n\\t\\t\\t1. \\tIf j is not within the range of the array, skip to the next index.  \\n\\t\\t\\t1. \\tOtherwise, add j to the set s3 and mark it as visited.  \\n\\t\\t1. \\tRemove the key-value pair corresponding to arr[i] from the dictionary.\\n\\t1. Set s1 to s3 and increment the variable step by 1.\\n1. If we have not returned in the while loop, return -1 as it means that we have not reached the end of the array.",

                "content": "The intuition is that we go from the 0th position and queue all the possible paths (which counts as one step) and then queue all of it\\'s path\\'s (second step) so on and so forth until we reach the destination (the last index or length of array - 1)\\n\\nThis is sounding a lot like Breadth First Search (BFS).  We can use a queue for this implementation.\\n\\nFrom any \"node\" we can calculate the neighboring nodes as such:\\n\\n1. i - 1 (one step backwards)\\n2. i + 2 (one step forwards)\\n3. any node that is the same value\\n\\nNow 1 and 2 seem pretty easy to do, however 3 seems like it would require some work up front because it would be less optimal to find all the occurence of a value as we are traversing this graph (and possibly giving it an exponential run-time).\\n\\nBecause of this, we\\'ll first iterate through the array and create a map that will allow us to get an array of all indexes for a given value.\\n\\nSo for a given array as such:\\n\\n```\\n[100,-23,-23,404,100,23,23,23,3,404]\\n```\\n\\nWe\\'ll have a map like so:\\n```\\n{\\n  \\'3\\': [ 8 ],\\n  \\'23\\': [ 5, 6, 7 ],\\n  \\'100\\': [ 0, 4 ],\\n  \\'404\\': [ 3, 9 ],\\n  \\'-23\\': [ 1, 2 ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe\\'ll start by initializing our queue with the 0th index.  We\\'ll then push any valid neighbors onto the queue (for number `1` & `2` check if values exist AND exists on the map (or else we traversed it already).\\n\\nAs we traverse through the graph, it\\'s important that we delete the key of this map.  Because otherwise we might run into TLE.  And if you think about it logically, when you come across a specific value, we\\'re able to calculate all the nodes of that value at once so there\\'s no need to calculate it again.\\n\\nThe calculation we do for every neighboring node is considered one step so after we iterate through the entirety of the queue, we increment steps or jumps (is what I called it).  So with every jump, we\\'re emptying out the queue and pushing onto it.\\n\\nBecause I increment jump before doing the traversal, it\\'s important for this implementation to check if the nodes i\\'m pushing onto the queue is the final destination so I can return it.  This is the reason for such code:  ```if (curr + 1 === arr.length - 1) return jumps```\\n\\nNotice that I did not do this check when calculating ```i - 1 ``` because it\\'s impossible for us to visit the previos node and have it be the destination :).\\n\\nJavascript Implementation:\\n\\n```\\n\\n/**\\n * @param {number[]} arr\\n * @return {number}\\n */\\nvar minJumps = function(arr) {\\n    \\n    if (arr.length === 1) return 0\\n    \\n    let map = {};\\n    \\n    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){\\n        if (map[arr[i]]){\\n            map[arr[i]].push(i);\\n        } else {\\n            map[arr[i]] = [i];\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    let jumps = 0;\\n    \\n    let q = [0];\\n    while (q.length != 0){\\n                \\n        jumps++;\\n        \\n        let clone = [...q];\\n        q = [];\\n        \\n        for (let i = 0 ; i < clone.length; i++){\\n            let curr = clone[i];\\n            \\n            if (arr[curr - 1] != undefined && map[arr[curr - 1]]) q.push(curr - 1);\\n            if (arr[curr + 1] != undefined && map[arr[curr + 1]]) {\\n                if (curr + 1 === arr.length - 1) return jumps\\n                q.push(curr + 1);\\n            }\\n            \\n            if (map[arr[curr]]){\\n                for (let j = 0; j < map[arr[curr]].length; j++){\\n                    if (map[arr[curr]][j] === arr.length - 1) return jumps\\n                }\\n                q = [...q, ...map[arr[curr]].filter((x) => x != curr)];\\n            }\\n            \\n            delete map[arr[curr]];\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    return jumps;\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

and usually when we need to compute how many steps it takes to come out of a graph, a BFS approach is a solid one!\\n\\nTo do so, we will first rule an edge case that would make any further effort pointless (when the array has `1` or `2` elements, the result is trivially the `arr.size() - 1`, no way to do less steps than that) and then declare a few support variables:\\n* `res` will store the current number of \"steps\" we have made so far (ie: how many BFS outer loop iterations we have ground to this point);\\n* `len` will store the length of the the original input;\\n* `qLen` will store the length of our `q`, initially set to `1`, since we will always have a sole starting point;\\n* `curr`, `prev` and `nxt` will be used in our inner BFS loop to keep track of what node we are currently processing and its neighbours;\\n* `target` stores our final destination, initialised with the value of the last element of `arr`;\\n* `connected` is an array showing us how similarly valued nodes are linked, forming the backbone of our graph traversal logic later;\\n* `unexplored` will keep track of the nodes we must still visit;\\n* `mustContinue` is a microoptimisation to let us know when we are in the last or penultimate cycle of our BFS search, initially set to `true`;\\n* `q` is the queue that will store the current and next level of our traversal, as in most standard BFS approaches - initially set to contain only the first node (our starting point).\\n\\nWe will then initialise all the values in `unexplored` to be `true` and populate `connected` so that each value of `arr` (key) will tell use what nodes share it and are thus linked (value).\\n\\nOkay, time for the main course, our BFS loops!\\n\\nWe  will have a main loop that will as long as we have a reason to go on (ie: `mustContinue != false`) and in it we will:\\n* run our level traversal, valid as long as `qLen-- != 0`, that is to say it will run `qLen` times and:\\n\\t* extract the current front of `q` and assign its value to `curr`;\\n\\t* pop that element out of the queue;\\n\\t* check if we reached our target, in which case we can just stop here and `return` `res`;\\n\\t* check if we will reach it on the next run (ie: `arr[curr] == target`, meaning we are on a cell that can teleport us to destination), in which case we do not quit immediately (we might have in the queue some node which is ALREADY the destination, so one less step!), but flag this situation turning `mustContinue` to `false`;\\n\\t* in case `mustContinue` is still `true`, we will then:\\n\\t\\t* flag the current node as explored;\\n\\t\\t* check the previous node `prev = curr - 1`, assuming it was not explored already or out of bonds, adding it to the queue;\\n\\t\\t* check the next node `nxt = curr - 1`, assuming it was not explored already or out of bonds, adding it to the queue;\\n\\t\\t* check all the connected nodes (if any) adding them to the queue (we know they were all not explored yet, since once you explore one of the connected ones, you get them all) and then removing that subnetwork from `connected`, in order to avoid parsing it again;\\n* prepare for the next iteration, increasing `res` by `1` and updating `qLen` with its new value.\\n\\nFinally, if we reached the end of the loop, we can just `return` `res` :)\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int minJumps(vector<int>& arr) {\\n        // edge cases\\n        if (arr.size() < 3) return arr.size() - 1;\\n        // support variables\\n        int res = 0, len = arr.size(), qLen = 1, curr, prev, nxt, target = arr.back();\\n        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> connected;\\n        bool unexplored[len], mustContinue = true;\\n        queue<int> q{{0}};\\n        // preparing unexplored and connected\\n        fill(unexplored, unexplored + len--, true);\\n        for (int i = 0;

BFS is a simple algorithm to reach the minimum path with edges of weight 1.\\n\\nEach node will have as adjacents the node+1, node-1, and all the nodes with the same value. To speed up the algorithm, we need to first calculate the nodes with the same value and store them in a dictionary.\\n\\nThe problem was a test that has a lot of elements 7,7,7,7,7 where we can get a memory limit. The solution is to delete the entry on the dictionary for the key = node. Line:\\n`\\nsame_value[arr[node]].clear()\\n`\\n\\nI recall that BFS is O(V+E) being V the number of nodes and E number of edges. The number of edges could be bigger than N (and it fact it is). The node 1 in example, is related to node 0 and 2 at least. If the node 1 has another node with the same value, the number of edges is going to be even bigger. So, I would state O(E) worst case being E the number of links due to E > N in this problem.\\n\\nThe other trick I\\'ve used is to keep the level in the same stack.

We will start from the first index of the array and visit all possible positions that we can jump to in one step. For each position, we will calculate the number of steps required to reach that position and add it to a queue. We will continue this process until we reach the last index of the array. At each step, we will also keep track of the indices that have been visited to avoid revisiting them.\\n\\n# Approach\\nIn this code, we first create a map indices that maps each integer value in the array to the indices where it occurs. This will allow us to efficiently find the indices that have the same value as the current index. We also create a visited array to keep track of the indices that have been visited.\\n\\nWe then add the first index (i.e., index 0) to the queue and start the BFS process. At each step, we dequeue an index from the queue and try to visit all possible positions that can be reached in one step. We add the new positions to the queue if they have not been visited before. If we reach the last index of the array, we return the number of steps required to reach it. If we cannot reach the last index, we return -1.\\n\\nNote that we use a while loop inside the main while loop to handle all the indices at the current level before moving to the next level. This ensures that we count the minimum number of steps required to reach the last index.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(N + klogk), where N is the length of the input array and k is the number of distinct values in the array.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(N + k), where N is the length of the input array and k is the number of distinct values in the array.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int minJumps(vector<int>& arr) {\\n        int n = arr.size();\\n        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> indices;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            indices[arr[i]].push_back(i);\\n        }\\n        vector<bool> visited(n);\\n        visited[0] = true;\\n        queue<int> q;\\n        q.push(0);\\n        int steps = 0;\\n        while (!q.empty()) {\\n            int size = q.size();\\n            while (size--) {\\n                int i = q.front();\\n                q.pop();\\n                if (i == n - 1) {\\n                    return steps;\\n                }\\n                if (i + 1 < n && !visited[i + 1]) {\\n                    visited[i + 1] = true;\\n                    q.push(i + 1);\\n                }\\n                if (i - 1 >= 0 && !visited[i - 1]) {\\n                    visited[i - 1] = true;\\n                    q.push(i - 1);\\n                }\\n                for (int j : indices[arr[i]]) {\\n                    if (!visited[j]) {\\n                        visited[j] = true;\\n                        q.push(j);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                indices[arr[i]].clear(); // optimization: avoid revisiting indices\\n            }\\n            steps++;\\n        }\\n        return -1; // the last index cannot be reached\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```",

                "content": "\\n## 1.  Problem Statement:\\n\\nImagine you\\'re standing on a number line that has a bunch of numbers on it. Each number represents a place you can jump to. You start at the first number, which is called the origin, and you want to jump to the last number, which is called the destination. But there\\'s a catch! Some of the numbers on the number line are the same, and if you land on one of those numbers, you can jump to any other place that has the same number.\\n\\nThe problem is that you want to get to the destination in the fewest possible jumps. Can you figure out how many jumps it will take to get from the origin to the destination?\\n\\n## 2.  Methodology:\\n\\nThe solution to this problem uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the origin to the destination. In order to implement the BFS algorithm, we use a queue to keep track of the indices that we need to visit, and we use a distance array to keep track of the minimum number of jumps it takes to get to each index.\\n\\nWe start by creating a dictionary that maps each number in the array to a list of indices where that number appears. Then we add the origin to the queue and set its distance to 0. We then loop through the queue, visiting each index in the queue and adding its neighbors to the queue if they haven\\'t been visited yet. We also keep track of the minimum distance it takes to get to each index.\\n\\nIf we reach the destination index while visiting the indices in the queue, we return the distance to the destination. If we\\'ve visited all the indices in the queue and still haven\\'t reached the destination, it means we can\\'t get to the destination, so we return -1.\\n\\n## 3.  Time and Space Complexity:\\n\\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the input array. This is because we visit each index in the array exactly once.\\n\\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the input array. This is because we use a queue and a distance array to keep track of the indices we need to visit and their minimum distances from the origin.\\n\\n## 4.  Explanation of the Code:\\n\\nThe code starts by importing the deque function from the collections module. We then define a class called Solution and a method called minJumps that takes an array of integers called arr as input and returns an integer.\\n\\nThe first few lines of the method are used to handle some special cases. If the length of the array is 1, we return 0 since we don\\'t need to make any jumps to get to the destination. We then create a dictionary called indices that maps each number in the array to a list of indices where that number appears.\\n\\nWe then use a deque called queue to keep track of the indices we need to visit. We add the origin index (which is 0) to the queue and create a distance array of size n (where n is the length of the input array). We set all the elements in the distance array to infinity except for the first element, which we set to 0 since the distance from the origin to the origin is 0.\\n\\nWe then start the BFS algorithm by looping through the indices in the queue. We pop the first index from the queue and get its distance from the origin. We check if we\\'ve reached the destination index, and if we have, we return the distance to the destination.\\n\\nWe then add the indices that have the same value as the current index to the queue. We also update their distances in the distance array if their current distances are infinity (meaning they haven\\'t been visited yet).\\n\\nWe then clear the queue, since we don\\'t need to visit the current index again, and move on to the next index in the queue. We continue this process until we reach the destination index or we\\'ve visited all the indices in the queue.\\n\\nIf we\\'ve visited all the indices in the queue and still haven\\'t reached the destination, it means we can\\'t get to the destination, so we return -1.\\n\\n## 5.  Summary:\\n\\nTo summarize, the problem asks us to find the minimum number of jumps it takes to get from the origin to the destination on a number line with some repeating numbers. We solve this problem by using a BFS algorithm that keeps track of the minimum distance it takes to get to each index. We create a dictionary that maps each number in the array to a list of indices where that number appears, and we use a queue to keep track of the indices we need to visit. We start the BFS algorithm by visiting the origin index and adding its neighbors to the queue. We update the distances in the distance array as we visit each index, and we return the distance to the destination index if we reach it. If we\\'ve visited all the indices in the queue and still haven\\'t reached the destination, we return -1. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), and the space complexity is also O(n).\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def minJumps(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:\\n        # Get the length of the array and check if there is only one element in the array.

                "content": "- The algorithm used in the code is based on Breadth First Search (BFS). The basic idea is to traverse the graph level by level, starting from the source node, and to keep track of the nodes visited so far. In this problem, the graph is represented by an array where each element is a list of indices of other elements that can be reached from it.\\n\\n- The algorithm maintains a queue of nodes to be visited next. Initially, the source node is added to the queue with a distance of 0. In each iteration, the algorithm removes a node from the front of the queue, and for each neighbor of the node that has not been visited yet, it adds the neighbor to the queue with a distance of one more than the distance of the current node.\\n\\n- In this particular implementation, the queue is implemented as a LinkedList, which provides O(1) time complexity for both adding and removing elements. The visited nodes are marked using a boolean array, which also provides O(1) time complexity for checking whether a node has been visited or not.\\n\\n- To optimize the algorithm further, the code uses a HashMap to keep track of the indices of elements with the same value. This avoids the need to scan the entire array to find all elements with the same value, which would have a time complexity of O(n).\\n\\n- Finally, the algorithm returns the distance to the last element of the array, which is the target node.\\n\\n- Overall, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, since each element is visited at most once. The space complexity is also O(n), since the queue and the visited array both require O(n) space. The additional space used by the HashMap is at most O(kn), where k is the maximum number of elements with the same value in the array. However, in practice, k is usually much smaller than n, so the overall space complexity is still O(n).\\n- PLEASE UPVOTE IT .

We can start the BFS from index 0 and keep track of the minimum number of steps required to reach each index. We can terminate the BFS as soon as we reach the last index, since that will give us the minimum number of steps required to reach the end.\\n\\nDuring the BFS, we need to consider three types of jumps: forward jumps to the next index, backward jumps to the previous index, and jumps to indices with the same value. We can use a queue to keep track of the nodes to be visited, and a visited array to avoid visiting the same node multiple times.\\n\\nOne optimization we can make is to pre-process the input array and create a mapping of each value to its indices. This will allow us to quickly identify the indices that can be reached by jumping to a value, without having to search the entire array every time.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n + v), where n is the length of the input array `arr` and v is the number of distinct values in `arr`.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(n + v)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @param Integer[] $arr\\n     * @return Integer\\n     */\\n    function minJumps($arr) {\\n        $n = count($arr);\\n        if ($n == 1) {\\n            return 0;\\n        }\\n        // Create a mapping of each value to its indices\\n        $valueToIndices = [];\\n        for ($i = 0; $i < $n; $i++) {\\n            $value = $arr[$i];\\n            if (!isset($valueToIndices[$value])) {\\n                $valueToIndices[$value] = [];\\n            }\\n            $valueToIndices[$value][] = $i;\\n        }\\n        // Perform BFS starting from index 0\\n        $queue = new SplQueue();\\n        $queue->enqueue([0, 0]); // [index, steps]\\n        $visited = array_fill(0, $n, false);\\n        $visited[0] = true;\\n        while (!$queue->isEmpty()) {\\n            [$index, $steps] = $queue->dequeue();\\n            if ($index == $n - 1) {\\n                return $steps;\\n            }\\n            // Try jumping to the next index\\n            if ($index + 1 < $n && !$visited[$index + 1]) {\\n                $queue->enqueue([$index + 1, $steps + 1]);\\n                $visited[$index + 1] = true;\\n            }\\n            // Try jumping to the previous index\\n            if ($index - 1 >= 0 && !$visited[$index - 1]) {\\n                $queue->enqueue([$index - 1, $steps + 1]);\\n                $visited[$index - 1] = true;\\n            }\\n            // Try jumping to indices with the same value\\n            $value = $arr[$index];\\n            if (isset($valueToIndices[$value])) {\\n                foreach ($valueToIndices[$value] as $nextIndex) {\\n                    if ($nextIndex != $index && !$visited[$nextIndex]) {\\n                        $queue->enqueue([$nextIndex, $steps + 1]);\\n                        $visited[$nextIndex] = true;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                unset($valueToIndices[$value]); // optimization to avoid redundant checks\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1; // unreachable\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

But we have to be careful of recalculating the same steps. For this, we will need an array of **boolean[] visited** to keep track of the visited **indices**. Also, when iterating for same values, we will ignore that. For this reason, when the value is first calculated in the queue, we will remove all the indices of the same value element. This way we can make this problem efficient. I got TLE several times while solving this problem.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nUsing BFS would take time complexity of *O(n+k)*. Here, *n* is the number of elements and the *k* is the maximum edge connecting an element. In worst case, all the elements can be same. But as we are not calculating repeating elements, it is good to go. The time complexity will stay around *O(n)*.\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nAs we are keeping a queue and also Clearing it out. There won\\'t be all the *n* elements at one time in the queue. But we have also used an array of **boolean[] visited** which is of size *n*. So, the space complexity would be *O(n)*.\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int minJumps(int[] arr) {\\n        int len = arr.length;\\n        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();\\n        for(int i=0; i<len; i++){\\n            map.computeIfAbsent(arr[i], x -> new LinkedList<>()).add(i);\\n        }\\n        boolean[] visited = new boolean[len];\\n        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();\\n        q.offer(0);\\n        visited[0] = true;\\n        int stepsTaken = -1;\\n        while(!q.isEmpty()){\\n            int size = q.size();\\n            stepsTaken++;\\n            while(size-->0){\\n                int idx = q.remove();\\n                if(idx==len-1)\\n                    return stepsTaken;\\n                List<Integer> next = map.get(arr[idx]);\\n                next.add(idx-1); next.add(idx+1);\\n                for(int i : next){\\n                    if(i>=0 && i<len && !visited[i]){\\n                        visited[i] = true;\\n                        q.offer(i);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                map.get(arr[idx]).clear();\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return 0;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/58ea33a3-d47b-44a1-9a1e-7af583173d20_1670178091.0691743.png)\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/0ad03c10-9b0d-4d2c-8451-bb5a171c70ff_1670178117.9879165.png)\\n",

I believe it is because of the result we cache may not be the optimal result (shortest path) in DFS, since DFS traverses nodes in **random** order, and we only cache the **first** result it find.\\n\\n@qiuqiushasha said the following\\n> To be very concise, the reason is that the jumper can jump back. For easier jump game question, the jumper never can jump back.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Detailed Explanation**\\nFirst of all, we want to model the problem in a way that we understand. Let `i` be the current index we examine, it can only go to the following indicies: `i + 1, i - 1, list of indicies where for each j in the list arr[j] == arr[i]`. We can think of it as a graph, and the problem becomes `starting at source (index 0), find the shortest path to target (index arr.length - 1)`. \\nThere, the solution becomes clear, since the most efficienct algorithm for shortest path in graph is always BFS, with a time complexity of `O(n)`\\nWhy doesn\\'t DFS + memo work? I believe it is because of the result we cache may not be the optimal result (shortest path) in DFS, since DFS traverses nodes in **random** order, and we only cache the **first** result it find.\\nOf course, you can do this with DFS alone by traverse *ALL* paths and return the shortest, but it has exponential time complexity of O(k^n) where k is the number of neighbours a node have. In this problem, this solution will cause TLE.\\nI am still trying to find a concrete, human-readable example that fails my DFS + memo algorithm. Let me know if you\\'ve already found one!"

This will be the maximum range for the next jump.\\n\\nFor each possible next jump, add the index to the queue if it has not been visited before. Also add this index to the visited set.\\n\\nIncrement the steps variable by 1, since a new jump is being made.\\n\\nRepeat steps 2-5 until the end of the array is reached or the queue is empty.\\n\\nIf the end of the array is not reached by the time the queue is empty, return -1, indicating that it is not possible to reach the end of the array."

Its main advantage is that we can assume that it takes constant time of O(1) to retrieve each stored element, so it is fast.\\n\\nIt also allows us to solve this problem by traversing the array only once:\\n\\nIn each iteration of a for statement we check if the current value already exists as a key in our object.\\n* If so, a number and its double exist in the array, we must return true.\\n* If not, store key/value pairs where one pair has the current element divided by 2 as a key and the other pair has the current element multiplied by 2 as a key. Notice that the values we store with each key do not matter, since we only check the keys.\\n\\nIf the for loop ends without finding a match, it means that the array does not contain a number and its double, we must return false.\\n\\nSince we created a Hash Table with a size that scales linearly according to the size of our input array, it has a linear space complexity of O(n).\\n\\nThis time we only traverse the array once, so it has a linear time complexity of O(n).\\n\\n```\\nvar checkIfExist = function(arr) {\\n    const hashTable = {};\\n    \\n    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i ++) {\\n      const currValue = arr[i];\\n      \\n      if(hashTable[currValue] !== undefined) {\\n        return true\\n      }\\n      hashTable[currValue / 2] = currValue;\\n      hashTable[currValue * 2] = currValue;\\n    }\\n  \\n  return false;\\n};\\n```\\n# **Map**\\nThis Hash Table approach could also be implemented by using the JavaScript built in Map data collection.\\n\\nThe main difference in our use case would be that instead of storing each key in the Hash Table as a string, we would store each key in a Map as a number. An Object only supports string and symbol as a key, but a Map supports objects and any primitive type as keys.\\n# **Set**\\nThe problem with using a Hash Table (object) or Map is that when we insert a key/value pair, the key is required but its value is not.\\nWhen we need a Hash Table data structure\\'s properties to solve the problem, but we only need keys instead of key/value pairs it makes sense to use a Set data collection.\\n**NOTE**: Keep in mind that a JavaScript built in Set only stores unique values.\\n\\nSimilar to an object and a Map, we can assume that we can retrieve a value from a Set with a constant time complexity of O(1).\\n\\nWe created a Set with a size that scales linearly according to the size of our input array, it has a linear space complexity of O(n).\\n\\nJust like our previous solution we only traverse the array once, so it has a linear time complexity of O(n).\\n\\n```\\nvar checkIfExist = function(arr) {\\n    const set = new Set();\\n    \\n    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i ++) {\\n      const currValue = arr[i];\\n      \\n      if(set.has(currValue)) {\\n        return true\\n      }\\n      set.add(currValue / 2);\\n      set.add(currValue * 2);\\n    }\\n  \\n  return false;\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "The algorithm runs in linear time if input is sorted as we have pointers i and j which traverses elements only once.\\nThe algorithm is as follows:\\n1. i and j are initialized to 0 (Note that j is not 1 as negative numbers can be in the array, see my earlier incorrect implementation to understand the difference).\\n2. Here i points to smaller of two elements in magnitude and j points to larger ( i.e `abs(arr[i]) < abs(arr[j])` ).\\n3. Now if i == j then either (i == 0 && j == 0), in that case if initial element is negative our smaller pointer i should be forwarded otherwise initial element is positive so j (larger pointer) should be forwarded. If i and j are not at 0 index then it means they both point to element \"0\" or transition point from negative to positive numbers in which case j should be ahead and thus incremented. (*Notice the difference between index 0 and element \"0\"*)\\n4. Now for the negative set of numbers j remains behind pointer i because of abs(i) < abs(j) invariant.\\n5. Finally i and j will merge on element \"0\" or transition point.\\n6. Now i and j will switch their relative order i.e i remains behind j because of our invariant abs(i) < abs(j).\\n7. For the rest casework is the usual two pointer comparison.\\n\\nThus we can independently check for negative set of values and positive set of values with same pointers within one loop. You can independently check for condition in negative values first and then positive using two different loops as well and that can make things clear for you.\\n\\nThe tricky part of this algorithm is to accomodate for negative values. If we see closely the pointers readjust themselves beautifully (that\\'s why *elegant two pointers*) while transitioning from negative values to positive values and we just need to take care of edge case as specified above which results in quite fast algorithm for sorted input.\\n\\n**Upvote** if you found it useful.\\n\\n```\\nbool checkIfExist(vector<int>& arr) {\\n        int n = arr.size();\\n        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());\\n        \\n        for(int i = 0, j = 0; i < n && j < n;) {\\n            if(i == j) {\\n                if(arr[i] >= 0)\\n                    j++;\\n                else\\n                    i++;\\n            }\\n            \\n            else if(2*arr[i] < arr[j])\\n                i++;\\n            else if(2*arr[i] > arr[j])\\n                j++;\\n            else\\n                return true;\\n        }\\n        \\n        return false;\\n    }\\n```\\n\\nMy earlier incorrect submission.

BINARY SEARCH - O(NLogN)**\\n\\nCan we do better than O(N^2)? \\n\\nFor every element, we are looking at every other element to see if it is a double. We have to do this because the list is not sorted so it is possible that for any element, its double is before it or after it in the list. \\n\\nBut if the list was sorted, then we can apply Binary Search because then, if the mid element is not double, then either it will be more than double or less than double. And based on that, we can either discard the left half or the right half. This will bring the complexity down to O(NLogN)\\n\\n```\\ndef checkIfExist(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:\\n        # To apply Binary Search, first sort the list\\n        arr.sort()\\n        \\n        n = len(arr)\\n        \\n        # For each element in the list\\n        for i,num in enumerate(arr):\\n            # Binary Search for its double\\n            start, end = 0, n - 1\\n            \\n            while start <= end:\\n                mid = start + (end - start) // 2\\n                \\n                # We also need to make sure i != j\\n                if arr[mid] == 2 * num and i != mid: return True\\n                \\n                # If the element at mid is less than the double of num\\n                # Then search for double at right of mid\\n                if arr[mid] < 2 * num: start = mid + 1\\n                    \\n                # Otherwise search for the double at the left side of mid\\n                else: end = mid - 1\\n                    \\n        \\n        return False\\n```\\n\\n# **3. USING A SET - O(N)**\\n\\nIs there a way to solve this problem in just one loop? Yes! See, we know that if the list is not sorted, then for any element, its double can either be on its left or its right. For a moment, lets forget that it is on the right. If the double of an element is on its left, then is there a way to check if the double exists on left in O(1) time? That\\'s where we can use a Set.\\n\\nAs we loop through every element, we also keep checking if we have already came across the double of that element before in the array. If yes, we got a pair. If not, we can put that element in set and move to the next iteration. \\n\\nBut there is one issue.\\n\\nLets take an example - \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t5 ,13, 10 ,6\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tHere, when we start the loop, we put 5 and 13 in the set as their doubles are not in set yet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, set = (5, 13)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tNow when we come to 10. We check if its double is in the set. We don\\'t find it so we move on.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd at the end, we return False.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tBut if you see, the double of 5 is 10 so there is a valid pair which means we should return True.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tAnd now you can see that we not only need to check for the double in set but also for the half.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tSo, for every element, we check if its half exists in set or if its double exists in set.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\tIn both cases, we have a valid pair.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nAnd that\\'s the whole idea of this approach.\\n\\nDo note that this approach will use extra space, something the previous two solutions don\\'t.\\n\\n```\\ndef checkIfExist(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:\\n        \\n        # Set so that lookup is in constant time\\n        nums = set()\\n        \\n        for el in arr:\\n            # if the double of this element is present in set\\n            # Or its half is present in the set\\n            # Then we have a pair\\n            if el * 2 in nums or el / 2 in nums: return True\\n            \\n            # Otherwise, add this element to set and move to the next iteration\\n            nums.add(el)\\n            \\n    \\n        # If we come out of loop, that means, there is no valid pair at all\\n        return False\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

                "content": "While I agree that it\\'s pretty efficient to use the O (n) time and space solution, this provides another way to think about the problem using sorting. Alot of solutions claim O(1) space, while it is true under ascii, what if we have an infinite alphabet? This algorithm is more elegant and is  a true constant space solution, if you consider sorting in place.\\n\\nLet\\'s pretend that sorting is in place (heap sort is one such inplace method). The key to understanding this solution is that when strings are lexicographically sorted, and since we maintain ptrs starting at the beginning and incrementing the lexicographically lagging value pointed to by one of the pointers, we realize that when two values pointed to by pointers arent equal, there couldn\\'t have been values before that matches this value due to sorting. This allows us to count the number of pairs of swaps doubled. We return // 2 at the end.\\n\\n* note that the code is greatly expanded out for clarity\\n\\n```\\n    def minSteps(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:\\n        val = 0\\n        sl = sorted(s)\\n        tl = sorted(t)\\n        ptrs, ptrl = 0, 0\\n\\t\\t\\n        while(ptrs < len(s) or ptrl < len(t)):\\n            if (ptrs >= len(s) or ptrl >= len(t)):\\n                if (ptrs < len(s)):\\n                    ptrs += 1\\n                else:\\n                    ptrl += 1\\n                val += 1\\n            else:\\n                if (sl[ptrs] == tl[ptrl]):\\n                    ptrs += 1\\n                    ptrl += 1\\n                elif(sl[ptrs] < tl[ptrl]):\\n                    ptrs += 1\\n                    val += 1\\n                else:\\n                    ptrl += 1\\n                    val += 1\\n        return val // 2\\n\\t```",

One possible approach is to count the number of occurrences of each character in both strings and then compare the counts. By counting the number of extra characters in one string and the number of missing characters in the other, we can determine how many steps are needed to make them equal.\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe approach used in the code is to create an array of counts for each character in the alphabet, initialized to 0. Then, for each character in string s, the count for that character is incremented. Next, for each character in string t, the count for that character is decremented. Finally, the absolute value of each count is taken and added together to get the total number of steps needed to convert s to t. The result is then divided by 2 because each step involves both adding and removing a character.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int minSteps(string s, string t) {\\n        int count[26] = {0};\\n        for (char c : s) {\\n            count[c - \\'a\\']++;\\n        }\\n        for (char c : t) {\\n            count[c - \\'a\\']--;\\n        }\\n        int res = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\\n            res += abs(count[i]);\\n        }\\n        return res / 2;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

If the 3 a\\'s are present in string s, increment the counter as many times. But if two a\\'s are already present in string t, decrement the counter as we already have those. Now iterate through our frequency vector and see if there are alphabets that are present in s but not t, and add that value to final answer. \\nIt can happen that string t has 2 b\\'s but string s doesnt, meaning freq1[1]=-2. What do we do in that case? We dont care about it, as the operation is substitution and new characters will be added to there place. Hence the method max(freq1[i], 0).\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(max(N, M)) where N and M are the length of strings s and t\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(1)\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int minSteps(string s, string t) {\\n        vector<int> freq1(26, 0);\\n        for(char c:s)\\n            freq1[c-\\'a\\']++;\\n        for(char c:t)\\n            freq1[c-\\'a\\']--;\\n        int ans = 0;\\n        for(int i=0; i<26; i++)\\n        {\\n            ans+=max(freq1[i], 0);\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

The `s.charAt(i) - 97` is for getting the position of the character. Since the ascii of `\\'a\\'` is `97` we can find the letter\\'s position. An example could be the letter `b`. `b` is `98` in the ascii table, so when we subtract `97` from `98` we get `1`, which is the position in the array where we put the occurence.\\n\\nThe second loop is for adding the number of occurrences that aren\\'t equal. The `Math.abs(first[i] - second[i]);` is for getting the difference of the number of occurrences, which intern tells us the number of extra characters that are not same, so we add that to the result of numbers that need to be changed.\\n\\n```\\npublic int minSteps(String s, String t) {\\n\\tint[] first = new int[26];\\n\\tint[] second = new int[26];\\n\\tint sum = 0;\\n\\tfor (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\\n\\t\\tfirst[s.charAt(i) - 97] += 1;\\n\\t\\tsecond[t.charAt(i) - 97] += 1;\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tfor (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\\n\\t\\tsum += Math.abs(first[i] - second[i]);\\n\\t}\\n\\treturn sum / 2;\\n}\\n```",

The goal is not to make the strings equal, but to make their anagrams equal, so as long as they have the same number of each letter then their anagrams are equal.\\n\\nOnce we calculate the discrepency, notice that swapping a letter will fix **2** instances of discrepancy.\\n\\nBecause the two strings are the same size, if one string has `n` extra letters, then it must also be missing `n` other letters from the other string. This means that if we take an extra letter in first string and make it into a missing letter in second string, then the *both* strings will have 1 less discrepancy, and thus the total discrepancy decreases by 2. Thus, every swap decreases discrepancy by 2.\\n\\nNotice that the number of total discrepancy is always even, because extra in 1 string implies missing in the other, so the discrepancies always come in pairs. \\n\\nBased on analysis all we need to do now is to calculate total discrepancy, then divide that by 2 to get the number of swaps needed.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int minSteps(string s, string t) {\\n        size_t size = s.size();\\n        vector<int> f(26, 0);\\n        for(int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {\\n            ++f[s[i]-\\'a\\'];\\n            --f[t[i]-\\'a\\'];\\n        }\\n        return accumulate(f.begin(), f.end(), 0, [](const int& a, const int &b) {return a + abs(b);})/2;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\nauto gucciGang = []() {std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);cin.tie(nullptr);cout.tie(nullptr);return 0;}();\\n```",

                "content": "# Approach\\nThe approach used in the given solution is quite clear and straightforward. Let\\'s break it down step-by-step:\\n\\n1. Initialize two arrays `arrS` and `arrT`, both of size 26, to keep track of the counts of each character in strings `s` and `t`. We are using a fixed-size array of 26 to represent lowercase English letters.\\n\\n2. Iterate through the characters of string `s`, and for each character, increment the count in the corresponding index of `arrS`. This step is performed to record the frequency of each character in `s`.\\n\\n3. Repeat the same process for string `t` to populate the `arrT` array with the counts of characters in `t`.\\n\\n4. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of steps required to make `t` an anagram of `s`. The initial value of `count` is set to 0.\\n\\n5. Iterate through the arrays `arrS` and `arrT` simultaneously. For each index, compare the counts of characters from `s` and `t`. If the count of a character in `t` is less than the count in `s`, it means that we need to make additional steps to increase the count of that character in `t`.\\n\\n6. In the inner loop, increment the count of that character in `t` and also increment the `count` variable to keep track of the total steps taken.\\n\\n7. After completing the loop, `count` will represent the minimum number of steps required to make `t` an anagram of `s`.\\n\\nThe logic behind this approach is that an anagram of a string is another string with the same characters but potentially in a different order. To make `t` an anagram of `s`, we need to ensure that both strings have the same count of each character. By calculating the difference in counts of each character between `s` and `t`, we determine the number of steps needed to modify `t` accordingly. The goal is to balance the counts of all characters in `t` with the counts in `s`.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {\\n        int[] arrS = new int[26];\\n        int[] arrT = new int[26];\\n\\n        for(char c : s.toCharArray()) {\\n            arrS[c - \\'a\\']++;\\n        }\\n\\n        for(char c : t.toCharArray()){\\n            arrT[c - \\'a\\']++;\\n        }\\n\\n        int count = 0;\\n\\n        for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++){\\n            while(arrS[i] > arrT[i]) {\\n                arrT[i]++;\\n                count++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return count;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",
