                "content": "# Intuition\\nThe problem requires removing duplicates from a sorted singly-linked list. The approach involves iterating through the list and removing duplicates while maintaining the sorted order.\\n\\n# Approach\\n- Initialize a pointer `current` to the head of the linked list to traverse the list.\\n- Start a while loop that continues until `current` reaches the end of the list or `current.next` reaches null.\\n- Inside the loop, compare the value of the current node `current.val` with the value of the next node `current.next.val`.\\n- If the values are equal, it indicates a duplicate node. In this case, update the `next` pointer of the current node `current.next` to skip the next node (remove the duplicate).\\n- If the values are not equal, move the `current` pointer to the next node, continuing the traversal.\\n- Repeat the loop until the end of the list is reached, ensuring that all duplicates are removed while maintaining the sorted order of the remaining nodes.\\n- After the loop, return the modified linked list, which contains no duplicates.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n)\\n  The algorithm iterates through the linked list once, where n is the number of nodes in the list. Each node is examined once to identify and remove duplicates.\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1)\\n  The algorithm uses a constant amount of additional memory space for variables, regardless of the size of the input linked list, making its space complexity constant.\\n\\n# Code\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n   public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {\\n        ListNode current = head;\\n\\n        while (current != null && current.next != null) {\\n            if (current.val == current.next.val) {\\n                current.next = current.next.next;\\n            } else {\\n                current = current.next;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return head;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n![c0504eaf-5fb8-4a1d-a769-833262d1b86e_1674433591.3836212.webp](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/03822e25-72a1-4bde-a0fe-7a31db27fa1f_1694283728.4735084.webp)\\n\\n\\n",

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nThe purpose of this code is to remove duplicate nodes from a linked list. It does this by iterating through the linked list and comparing the values stored in each node to the values stored in the nodes that come after it. If it finds two nodes with the same value, it deletes the second of the two nodes.\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n1. The function begins by checking if the head argument is null, in which case it returns null. This check handles the case of an empty linked list.\\n2. The function then declares a local variable curr and initializes it to head. This variable will be used to iterate through the linked list and delete any duplicate nodes.\\n3. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as curr.next is not null. This loop will iterate through the entire linked list.\\n4. Within the loop, the function checks if the value stored in the current node (curr.val) is equal to the value stored in the next node (curr.next.val). If these values are equal, then the current node and the next node are duplicates, and the next node needs to be deleted.\\n5. To delete the next node, the function first stores a reference to the node after the next node (next_next). This is necessary because after the next node is deleted, we will need to update curr.next to skip over the deleted node and point to the node after the next node.\\n6. The function then declares a local variable nodeToDelete and initializes it to curr.next, which is the node that needs to be deleted.\\n7. The function then calls the built-in delete function and passes it nodeToDelete, which deletes the node from the linked list.\\n8. Finally, the function updates curr.next to point to the node after the next node (next_next), effectively skipping over the deleted node.\\n9. If the values stored in curr.val and curr.next.val are not equal, then the current node and the next node are not duplicates, and the loop simply advances curr to the next node by updating curr to curr.next.\\n10. After the loop completes, the function returns head, which is the reference to the head node of the linked list with the duplicates removed.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because the function iterates through the entire linked list once, performing a constant amount of work on each iteration.\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe space complexity of this code is O(1), because the function only uses a constant amount of space regardless of the size of the input. The only variables that are allocated are \"curr\",\" next_next\", and \"nodeToDelete\", which are all fixed-size variables that do not depend on the size of the input.\\n# Code\\n```\\n/**\\n * Definition for singly-linked list.\\n * function ListNode(val, next) {\\n *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)\\n *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)\\n * }\\n */\\n/**\\n * @param {ListNode} head\\n * @return {ListNode}\\n */\\nvar deleteDuplicates = function(head) {\\n    //empty list\\n    if(head == null)\\n    return null;\\n\\n   let curr = head;\\n    while(curr.next != null){\\n    \\n        if(curr.val == curr.next.val){\\n          let next_next = curr.next.next;\\n          let nodeToDelete = curr.next;\\n          delete(nodeToDelete);\\n          curr.next = next_next;\\n        }\\n        else//not equal\\n        { \\n          curr = curr.next;\\n        }\\n       \\n    }\\nreturn head;\\n};\\n**<!-- Please upvote if you like this solution -->**\\n```",

Then, we go through the list up until the end and check to see if the value of the current node is equal to the value of the next node. If it is, then we skip the duplicate node by setting ```head.next = head.next.next```. If we just removed a duplicate, we don\\'t know if the next node is also a duplicate, so we should not move forward with ```head = head.next``` like we do when we do not find a duplicate.\\nThis solution only needs to look at every node once, giving ```O(N)``` time complexity. Since it requires a constant amount of additional space, the memory complexity is ```O(1)```.\\n\\nP.S. ```while head and head.next``` is the same as ```while head is not None and head.next is not None``` \\u2013\\u2013 it just checks that neither of them are ```None```.\\n\\n**Thanks for Reading!**\\nIf this post has been helpful, please consider upvoting!

                "content": "# Intuition\\nOur goal is to remove duplicate nodes while maintaining the order. Since the list is sorted, duplicate nodes will be adjacent to each other. We just need to skip them.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. We start with a pointer called `curr` that initially points to the `head` of the linked list.\\n1. We use a while loop to iterate through the linked list as long as `curr` is not None and `curr.next` is not None. This loop will help us traverse the linked list and examine each pair of adjacent nodes.\\n1. Inside the loop, we compare the value of the current node `curr `with the value of the next node `curr.next`.\\n1. If the values are equal, it means we\\'ve found a duplicate node. In this case, we **update the next pointer of the current node** `curr` **to skip the next node and directly point to the node after the duplicate.** This effectively removes the duplicate node from the linked list.\\n1. If the values are not equal i.e. not duplicates, we move the `curr` **pointer** **one step forward** to examine the next pair of nodes.\\n1. The loop continues until we reach the end of the linked list or until we\\'ve checked all pairs of adjacent nodes.\\n1. Finally, we return the head of the modified linked list.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe algorithm iterates through the entire linked list once. Thus, the time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nWe are using only a constant amount of extra space to store the curr pointer. No additional data structures are used, so the space complexity is $$O(1)$$.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:\\n        curr = head\\n\\n        while curr and curr.next:\\n            if curr.val == curr.next.val:\\n                curr.next = curr.next.next\\n            else:\\n                curr = curr.next\\n        \\n        return head\\n```",

                "content": "# Explaination:\\nThis problem is asking us to delete all duplicate nodes, so after we visit a node, if there are any other nodes with the same value, delete them and only keep the first instance of that node.\\n**Example:** 1->1->2->3\\nAs you can see `1` appears twice, we want to remove the duplicate, that would be the second `1`. \\nAfter removing it the result should look like: 1->2->3\\n\\n**Solution Breakdown:**\\n1. We create a variable `current` and initialize it to be the `head` of our linked list input\\n2. We setup our `while` loop to keep iterating while `current` and `current.next` are **NOT** `None`. The reason we do this is because we want to check the `current` node and one node after the `current` node and we want to compare their values to see if they are the same.\\n3. If the `current` node value is the same as the `current.next` value, we found a duplicate, so we change the pointer to skip the `.next` node and point to the node AFTER `current.next`. The reason why we do this is because we want to get rid of duplicates. So 1->1->2->3, the first `1` in that list will now skip the second `1` and point to the `2` like 1->2->3.\\n4. Notice how we don\\'t update `current`, we only update `current.next`, this is because there can be more duplicates. Imagine our input was 1->1->1->2->3. After updating `current.next` it would become 1->1->2->3, we deleted the second `1` in the list and pointed the first `1` to the third `1`. But if we update our current to be `current.next.next` we will end up not deleting the third `1` which is also a duplicate. `current` would point to that `1` and the next node after would be `2`, then our `if` statement would not catch the duplicate. Since we didn\\'t update the `current` we are still at the first `1` so `current.val` will be `1` and `current.next.val` will be `1` now we can delete that last one to make the list 1->2->3.\\n5. If `current` and `current.next` do not have the same values, we just update `current` like normal and set it to `current.next`\\n6. We return `head` after we finish.\\n\\n**Time O(N) | Space O(1):**\\nTime is O(N) because at most we are just going through the entire linked list once\\nSpace is O(1) because we don\\'t have anything saved in memory which is scaling with our input. We only have a variable which we use to update pointers.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:\\n        current = head\\n        \\n        while current and current.next:\\n            if current.val == current.next.val:\\n                current.next = current.next.next\\n            else:\\n                current = current.next\\n        return head\\n```\\n",

In each each iteration check if data of next node of temp and data of current node of temp are equal or not , if both data are equal then we have a duplicate value , so update the next node of \\'temp\\' to temp->next->next;\\n\\n3. While we update the next value of temp if duplicate value is found we also need to delete the node where duplicate value exist, NOTE:- It will be better practice if you store the node to be deleted in another variable and then delete this variable instead of directly deleting the node to be delected bcoz it may lead to errors.\\n\\n4. But if the next value of temp is not equal to temp i.e no duplicate value then move the temp to next position , repeat this process and when the loop terminates you will get your list without duplicate values."

Initialize a pointer to head, here I used \\'temp\\' and iterate it over the linked list.\\n\\n2. In each each iteration check if data of next node of temp and data of current node of temp are equal or not , if both data are equal then we have a duplicate value , so update the next node of \\'temp\\' to temp->next->next;\\n\\n3. While we update the next value of temp if duplicate value is found we also need to delete the node where duplicate value exist, NOTE:- It will be better practice if you store the node to be deleted in another variable and then delete this variable instead of directly deleting the node to be delected bcoz it may lead to errors.\\n\\n4. But if the next value of temp is not equal to temp i.e no duplicate value then move the temp to next position , repeat this process and when the loop terminates you will get your list without duplicate values."

The condition \\\\~customers[\\'id\\'].isin(orders[\\'customerId\\']) checks if the \\'id\\' column in the \\'customers\\' DataFrame is not present in the \\'customerId\\' column of the \\'orders\\' DataFrame. The tilde (~) operator negates the result, so we select only the rows where the \\'id\\' is not found in the \\'customerId\\' column of the \\'orders\\' DataFrame.\\n\\n- df = df[[\\'name\\']].rename(columns={\\'name\\': \\'Customers\\'}): After filtering, we create a new DataFrame df containing only the \\'name\\' column. The [[\\'name\\']] part is used to select only the \\'name\\' column and keep it as a DataFrame. Then, we rename this column from \\'name\\' to \\'Customers\\' using the rename function. The resulting DataFrame df contains the names of customers who never placed any orders, and the column is labeled as \\'Customers\\'.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the find_customers function takes two DataFrames, \\'customers\\' and \\'orders\\', and filters the \\'customers\\' DataFrame to find customers whose \\'id\\' is not present in the \\'orders\\' DataFrame\\'s \\'customerId\\' column. It then returns a new DataFrame with the names of these customers, labeled as \\'Customers\\'. This function effectively finds customers who never placed any orders.\\n\\n# Code -2\\n```\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\ndef find_customers(customers: pd.DataFrame, orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\\n    # Merge the customers DataFrame with the orders DataFrame using a left join on \\'id\\' and \\'customerId\\'\\n    merged_df = customers.merge(orders, how=\\'left\\', left_on=\\'id\\', right_on=\\'customerId\\')\\n    \\n    # Use the \\'customerId\\' column to create a boolean mask for customers who never placed any orders\\n    mask = merged_df[\\'customerId\\'].isna()\\n    \\n    # Filter the rows using the boolean mask\\n    result_df = merged_df[mask]\\n    \\n    # Select only the \\'name\\' column from the result DataFrame and rename it as \\'Customers\\'\\n    result_df = result_df[[\\'name\\']].rename(columns={\\'name\\': \\'Customers\\'})\\n    \\n    return result_df\\n```\\n# Approach\\n- We first merge the \\'customers\\' DataFrame with the \\'orders\\' DataFrame using a left join. This allows us to have a DataFrame where each row represents a customer and includes any orders they may have placed.\\n\\n- We create a boolean mask named mask by checking if the \\'customerId\\' column in the merged DataFrame is null. This mask will be True for customers who never placed any orders and False for customers who placed orders.\\n\\n- We use the boolean mask mask to filter the rows from the \\'customers\\' DataFrame, selecting only those customers who never placed any orders.\\n\\n- We select only the \\'name\\' column from the filtered DataFrame and rename it as \\'Customers\\'.\\n\\n- Finally, we return the resulting DataFrame containing the names of customers who never placed any orders, labeled as \\'Customers\\'.\\n\\nThis approach achieves the same goal of finding customers who never placed any orders but uses a different technique involving a left join and boolean masking.\\n![upvote img.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/441daa56-1fa3-4101-a22b-1bbfd544f186_1690899691.199999.jpeg)\\n\\n",

The space complexity is proportional to the number of rows returned by the query.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n# Write your MySQL query statement below\\nSelect Name as Customers from Customers where Id not in \\n(\\n    Select CustomerId from Orders\\n)\\n```",

More complicated questions are looking for records in table A but not in table B with certian critera (e.g. range of time, overlaps, flags, distinct values).\\n\\nSimilar questions: 1084, 1581, 1809, 577, 1350, 1607, 607\\n\\nSimilar type of questions: \\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-bought-products-a-and-b-but-not-c/discuss/1220534/four-solutions-for-this-type-of-questions-in-a-and-b-andnot-c\\n\\nSolution 1: Use left outer join\\n```\\nSELECT customers.Name as Customers\\n  FROM customers\\n  LEFT JOIN Orders\\n    ON customers.id = Orders.CustomerId\\n WHERE customerId IS NULL\\n```\\n\\nSolution 2: Put records not needed in a subquery. Then select records from table A WHERE the records are NOT IN/EXIST in the records selected by the subquery. \\n```\\nSELECT customers.Name as Customers\\n  FROM customers\\n WHERE ID not in (SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders)\\n```\\nSolution 3: Create a flag using SUM(CASE WHEN). And select all records with the corresponding flag. \\n```\\nSELECT Name AS Customers\\n  FROM(\\nSelect Customers.id, Name, SUM(CASE WHEN Customers.id = Orders.Customerid THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score\\n  FROM Customers\\n  LEFT JOIN Orders\\n    ON Customers.id = Orders.CustomerId\\n GROUP BY 1,2)a\\n WHERE a.score = 0\\n ```\\n\\nSolution 4: If there\\'s a range or there are multiple records for one id, using GROUP BY + HAVING (criteria) to evaluate the aggregated results. This solution does not really apply to this question..",

To achieve this, we can utilize a LEFT JOIN operation to match customers with orders. If a customer doesn\\'t have a corresponding order (i.e., the customerId is NULL), it means they never placed an order.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Select the name column from the Customers table as Customers.\\n1. Perform a LEFT JOIN operation between the Customers and Orders tables using the customerId as the join condition.\\n1. Filter out the rows where the customerId in the Orders table is NULL. These are the customers who never placed an order.\\n1. Return the result, which will be the list of customer names (Customers) who never placed an order.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time complexity of this solution depends on the size of the Customers and Orders tables. In the worst case, we may need to compare every customer with every order, resulting in a time complexity of $$O(n*m)$$, where n is the number of customers and m is the number of orders.\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity of this solution depends on the size of the result set, which is the list of customers who never placed an order.

Main idea\\n* We use` i` to keep track of position of the first zero in the list (which changes as we go).\\n* We use` j `to keep track of the first non-zero value after the first zero (which is pointed by `i`).\\n* Each time we have` i` correctly points to a zero and `j` correctly points to the first non-zero after `i`, we swap the values that store at `i` and `j`.\\n* By doing this, we move zeros towards the end of the list gradually until `j` reaches the end.\\n* And when it does, we are done.\\n\\n# 3. Remarks\\n* No return value needed, since we are doing in-place modification.\\n* We use` nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]` to achieve the in-place modification because Python allows you to swaps values in a list using syntax: `x, y = y, x`.\\n\\n****Please upvote if you find this post useful, and welcome to any further discussion!***",

                "content": "# Approach\\nThis code is for a method called `moveZeroes` that takes an array of integers called `nums` as input and moves all the zeros to the end of the array while keeping the order of the non-zero elements unchanged. Let\\'s break down the code step by step:\\n\\n1. Initialize a variable `i` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the index where the next non-zero element should be placed.\\n\\n2. Start a loop that iterates over each element `num` in the `nums` array.\\n\\n3. Check if the current element `num` is not equal to 0 (which means it\\'s a non-zero element).\\n\\n4. If the current element is non-zero, assign it to the position `nums[i]` in the array, and then increment `i` by 1. This moves the non-zero element to the left side of the array.\\n\\n5. After processing all the elements in the array, there might be some remaining positions towards the end of the array that need to be filled with zeros. \\n\\n6. Start another loop that continues from the last value of `i` until the end of the array (`nums.length`). \\n\\n7. Set the value of `nums[i]` to 0, effectively placing zeros in the remaining positions at the end of the array.\\n\\n8. Increment `i` by 1 in each iteration to move to the next position in the array.\\n\\n9. Once this loop is completed, all the non-zero elements have been moved to the front of the array, and any remaining positions towards the end of the array have been filled with zeros.\\n\\nThe code rearranges the array in-place, meaning it modifies the original `nums` array without creating a new one. After calling this `moveZeroes` method, the array `nums` will have all the zeros moved to the end while preserving the order of the non-zero elements.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {\\n        int i = 0; \\n        for (int num:nums){\\n            if(num != 0){\\n                nums[i] = num;\\n                i++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        while(i<nums.length){\\n            nums[i] = 0;\\n            i++;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n**Please upvote if you like the solution.\\nHappy Coding!** \\uD83D\\uDE0A",

The relative order of the non-zero elements will remain the same as in the original vector.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that this solution operates in-place, meaning it modifies the original vector without using any extra space.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(n)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(1)\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n= nums.size();\\n        int start=0, end=n-1,mid=0;\\n        while(mid<=end){\\n            if(nums[mid]!=0){\\n                swap(nums[start],nums[mid]);                  \\n                    start++;\\n            }\\n            mid++;\\n        }\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n![upvote 1.jpeg](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b3a0cacd-6403-44e6-a08a-f5c947c9c49c_1681675209.6594658.jpeg)\\n",

                "content": "# Solution no. 01\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n# Intuition\\nWhen approaching this problem, the idea is to perform an in-place modification of the given list of numbers. We can achieve this by first iterating through the list and moving all non-zero elements to the beginning of the list. Once we have moved all non-zero elements, we can fill the remaining positions with zeros. This approach ensures that the original order of non-zero elements is preserved while zeros are pushed to the end of the list.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Initialize a variable index to keep track of the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.\\n1. Iterate through each element num in the nums list.\\n   - If num is not equal to zero, assign num to the position index in the nums list and increment index.\\n1. After the iteration, all non-zero elements have been placed at the beginning of the list, and index indicates the position where the first zero should be placed.\\n1. Iterate from index to the end of the list, assigning zero to each position to fill the remaining positions with zeros.\\n\\nBy following this approach, we ensure that all non-zero elements are moved to the start of the list while maintaining their original order, and the remaining positions are filled with zeros.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n    - The first pass through the list takes O(n) time to move non-zero elements to the start of the list.\\n    - The second pass through the list takes O(n) time to fill the remaining positions with zeros.\\n    - The overall time complexity is dominated by the linear passes through the list, resulting in **O(n)** time complexity.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n    - The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size. Hence Space complexity of this code is **O(1)**\\n    - It modifies the input list in-place without requiring additional data structures.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:\\n        index = 0\\n\\n        # Place non-zero elements at the start of the list\\n        for num in nums:\\n            if num != 0:\\n                nums[index] = num\\n                index += 1\\n\\n        # Fill the remaining positions with zeroes\\n        while index < len(nums):\\n            nums[index] = 0\\n            index += 1\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n# Solution no. 02\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Intuition\\nInstead of directly filling the positions with zero after placing non-zero elements, we can maintain a pointer to indicate the position where the next non-zero element should be placed. This way, we only perform assignments when necessary, reducing the total number of assignments.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Initialize a variable index to 0, which represents the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.\\n1. Iterate through each element num in the nums list.\\n1. If num is not equal to zero, swap nums[index] and nums[i], and increment index.\\n1. After the iteration, all non-zero elements have been moved to their correct positions, and all positions after index are filled with zeros.\\n1. By swapping non-zero elements with the position index, we achieve the desired result without needing a separate loop to fill remaining positions with zeros.\\n\\nComplexity\\n- Time complexity: \\n    - **O(n)**\\n    - The single pass through the list takes O(n) time.\\n    - The number of assignments is minimized, which improves the constant factors involved in the time complexity.\\n\\n- Space complexity: \\n    - **O(1)**\\n    - The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space for variables.\\n    - It modifies the input list in-place without requiring additional data structures.\\n    \\nWhile this alternative approach doesn\\'t change the big-O time and space complexities, it might result in slightly better performance due to the reduced number of assignments.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:\\n        index = 0  \\n       \\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\\n            if nums[i] != 0:\\n                # If the current element is non-zero, swap it with the element at index\\n                # This effectively moves non-zero elements to the beginning of the list\\n                nums[i], nums[index] = nums[index], nums[i]\\n                index += 1 \\n                \\n```\\n\\n\\n",

Push the current index to queue because it has 0 now! *[simply we swap the current element with the first index available in the queue & push current index as that have 0 now]*.\\n- Remove the first element using pop(), because queue remove element from front.\\n- **Time complexity:** O(n).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Code:\\n\\n```cpp\\n//Solution 01:\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n= nums.size();\\n        int i=0, j=0;\\n        \\n        while(i<n){\\n            if(nums[i]!=0){\\n                swap(nums[i], nums[j]);\\n                i++; j++;\\n            }\\n            else \\n                i++;\\n        }\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n//Solution 02:\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n= nums.size();\\n        queue<int> add;\\n        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){\\n            if(nums[i]==0)\\n                add.push(i);\\n            else{\\n                if(!add.empty()){\\n                    int x=add.front();\\n                    nums[x]=nums[i];\\n                    nums[i]=0;\\n                    add.push(i);\\n                    add.pop();\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n> **Please upvote this solution**\\n>",

We iterate over the vector and increment the snowball variable whenever we encounter a zero. When we encounter a non-zero element, we check if the snowball variable is greater than zero. If it is, we move the non-zero element to its correct position in the vector by swapping it with the element snowball positions before it. We then set the swapped element to zero.\\n\\nBy the end of the iteration, all the non-zero elements are in their correct positions, and all the zeros are at the end of the vector.****\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:$$O(n)$$\\n\\n\\n- Space complexity:$$O(1)$$\\n\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public:\\n     void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        // snowball approach time=O(n) space=o(1)\\n        int snowball=0;\\n\\n        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){\\n            if(nums[i]==0){\\n                snowball++;\\n            }\\n\\n            else if(snowball>0){\\n                nums[i-snowball]=nums[i];\\n                nums[i]=0;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Otherwise only i will be increamented to find the next non-zero element.\\n# Optimized Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {\\n        int n=nums.size();\\n        int j=-1;\\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\\n            if(nums[i]==0){\\n                j=i;\\n                break;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        if(j==-1){\\n            return ;\\n        }\\n        for(int i=j+1;i<n;i++){\\n            if(nums[i]!=0){\\n                swap(nums[i],nums[j]);\\n                j++;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n$$O(n)$$\\n- Space complexity:\\n\\n$$O(1)$$ --> No extra space is used\\n\\n# Please Upvote if you find it helpful \\u2B06\\uFE0F",

The first pointer tracks the position of the last encountered non-zero element (initialized to zero), while the second pointer traverses the list. When we come across a non-zero element, we swap it with the element at the position indicated by the first pointer, and then increment the first pointer. This process ensures that all non-zero elements are shifted to the front of the array, while preserving their relative order. Finally, we fill the remaining elements with zeros.\\n\\nIf you find this helpful, please consider liking this post. I\\'ll continue to share more solutions like this.

To achieve this, we need to count the occurrences of each character in the magazine and check if there are enough occurrences to form the ransom note.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Create a HashMap called dictionary to store the character counts in the magazine.\\n1. Iterate through each character in the magazine string.\\n1. If the character is not present in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.\\n1. If the character is already present, increment its count by 1.\\n1. Iterate through each character in the ransom note string.\\n1. Check if the character is present in the dictionary and its count is greater than 0.\\n1. If both conditions are satisfied, decrement the count of the character in the dictionary.\\n1. If a character is not present in the dictionary or its count is 0, return false.\\n1. If all characters in the ransom note have been checked successfully, return true.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe time complexity of the solution is $$O(m + n)$$, where m is the length of the magazine string and n is the length of the ransom note string. This is because we iterate through each character in both strings once.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity is $$O(m)$$, where m is the number of unique characters in the magazine string.

Please don\\'t get confuse with compare two string as here we have few test cases that can cause issue if you are thinking to directly compare two strings.\\n\\n**APPROACH:** \\uD83D\\uDCA1\\n\\n**FIRST APPROACH:**\\n\\nA lot of ways to solve this ques but i will try to answer optimized way that is only traverse a single time. **O(n)**\\n\\nHere we can store the count of string chars in a map or array and then directly compare them which will save our no. computation and iteration for solving the problem.\\n\\n**C++ CODE**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {\\n        \\n        unordered_map<char, int> rm;\\n        unordered_map<char, int> mz;\\n        \\n        for(auto x: ransomNote) rm[x]++;\\n        for(auto x: magazine) mz[x]++;\\n        \\n        for(auto x : rm)\\n        {\\n            if(mz[x.first]<x.second)\\n                return false;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n     }\\n};\\n```\\n**PYTHON SOLUTION**\\n\\nAs always python has so many ways to solve the problem as coding gets simpler with phthon if you are doing it with something related to list or string.

One who solves simple code with variety will learn faster than those who solves otherwise. \\uD83D\\uDD25\\uD83D\\uDD25\\uD83D\\uDD25\\n\\n**JAVA CODE** \\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {\\n        char[] rs = ransomNote.toCharArray();\\n        char[] ms = magazine.toCharArray();\\n        \\n        HashMap<Character, Integer> rm = new HashMap<>();\\n        HashMap<Character, Integer> mz = new HashMap<>();\\n        \\n        for (char c : rs) {\\n            if (rm.containsKey(c)) {\\n                rm.put(c, rm.get(c) + 1);\\n            } else {\\n                rm.put(c, 1);\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        for (char c : ms) {\\n            if (mz.containsKey(c)) {\\n                mz.put(c, mz.get(c) + 1);\\n            } else {\\n                mz.put(c, 1);\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        for (char c : rm.keySet()) {\\n            if (!mz.containsKey(c) || mz.get(c) < rm.get(c)) {\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return true;  \\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**SECOND APPROACH**\\uD83D\\uDCA1\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/0c0db7f6-29b5-428d-814b-e596d65ca605_1661408247.0688927.png)\\n\\n\\nIn this approach we are not considering storing both the string in two different collection object like map or any other. Instead we will take just single array and in that array we will add the count of **MAGAZINE** string. \\n\\n**How :**  *As we know array index start with 0 so we will make alphabet a as our starting element and all other element we will add by subtract a from that.*\\n\\nFor example your **RANSOMNOTE** is : \"gfg\" and **MAGAZINE** is: \"gfxgt\"\\n\\nNow our count array will start with :\\n\\n0 : a\\n1 : b\\n2 : c\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n25: z\\n\\nIt means if we go with ASCII value of ***Magazine*** string we will have to subtract **a** from it and we will get the index position of that char in the count array in this manner it will also become easy to find any char of ***RansomNote*** in the count array. \\n\\n***for example : g will take 6th index as  103-97 = 6th.***\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t:f will take 5th index as 102-97 = 5th\\n\\nTill this we know how to store and found now what about comparision like count of **g** in ransomNote is 2 and how to check whether it is same in Magazine. For this to work we will decrease the count of ***Magazine*** string char whenever we found them in RansomNote and if it gets to less than zero we will return False as it means we don\\'t have enough char in Magazine as we have in ransomNote.\\n\\nFinally we get out of loop it means we haven\\'t got False so we will return True at the end.\\n\\n**C++ CODE**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {\\n        \\n        int m[26] = {0};\\n        for(int i = 0; i < magazine.size(); i++)\\n            m[magazine[i]-\\'a\\']++;\\n        for(int i = 0; i < ransomNote.size(); i++)\\n            if(m[ransomNote[i]-\\'a\\']-- == 0)\\n                return false;\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n**PYTHON CODE** \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:\\n        for c in ransomNote:\\n            if c not in magazine:\\n                return False\\n            magazine = magazine.replace(c, \\'\\', 1)\\n        return True\\n        \\n```\\n\\nI hope here you got another way to solve this problem other than what you are thinking.\\nI will add other approach soon.\\n\\n**Thanks for your time.** \\u2764\\uFE0F\\u2764\\uFE0F\\u2764\\uFE0F",

We define a class Solution and a method canConstruct which takes two string arguments, ransomNote and magazine.\\n\\n2. We create Counter objects for both the ransomNote and magazine strings using the Counter() function from the collections module. Counter() returns a dictionary with the keys being the unique characters in the string and the values being the frequency of each character.\\n\\nFor example, Counter(\"aab\") would return a dictionary {\\'a\\': 2, \\'b\\': 1}.\\n\\n3. We then check if the intersection of the note and mag Counter objects is equal to the note Counter object. We do this using the bitwise AND operator (&). The intersection of two Counter objects is another Counter object that contains the common keys and the minimum value from each object as the value for the key.\\n\\nFor example, if note = Counter(\"aab\") and mag = Counter(\"abc\"), note & mag would return a Counter object {\\'a\\': 1, \\'b\\': 1}.\\n\\n4. If the intersection of note and mag is equal to note, it means that all the letters in ransomNote can be formed using the letters in magazine. In this case, we return True, otherwise we return False.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:\\n        \\n        # Create Counter objects for the ransomNote and magazine strings\\n        note, mag = Counter(ransomNote), Counter(magazine)\\n        \\n        # Check if the intersection of note and mag Counter objects is equal to note Counter object\\n        # If it is, it means that all the letters in ransomNote can be formed using the letters in magazine\\n        if note & mag == note: return True\\n        return False\\n```",

For each character, we check if it is present in the magazine string. If the character is found, it means we can use it to construct the ransomNote, so we remove that character from the magazine string by calling magazine.remove(char).\\n\\nIf a character in ransomNote is not found in magazine, it means we cannot construct the ransomNote using the available characters, so we immediately return False.\\n\\nAfter iterating over all characters in ransomNote, if we have successfully removed each character from the magazine string, it means we can construct the ransomNote using the letters from magazine, while satisfying the constraint that each letter in magazine can only be used once. In this case, we return True.\\n\\nThe approach of converting the strings to lists allows us to manipulate the magazine string by removing characters as they are used, effectively ensuring that each letter in magazine is used only once.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n*m)\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(n+m)\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:\\n        ransomNote = list(ransomNote)\\n        magazine = list(magazine)\\n        for char in ransomNote:\\n            if char in magazine:\\n                magazine.remove(char)\\n            else:\\n                return False\\n        return True\\n```",

Take for example:\\nransomNote: `\"bdc\"`\\nmagazine: `\"ccabd\"`\\n\\nAfter sorting it becomes:\\nransomNote: `bcd`\\nmagazine: `abccd`\\n\\nNow we can use a two pointer technique to check if there are enough characters in magazine to build ransomNote.\\n\\nThere could be few states in the two pointers:\\n1. magazine points to a character which is smaller lexicographically than the pointer in ransomNote, so we simply move magazine pointer forward. In the previous example, `a` is redundant.\\n2. After we \"caught up\" with magazine pointer, we must point on both strings to the same character. If we don\\'t it means that the character doesn\\'t exist in magazine = return false.\\n3. If we do point to the same characters, increment both pointers.\\n\\nIn the end you must check whether the pointer for ransomNote reached the end, a condition where it doesn\\'t can happen where you exhaust magazine characters first. For example: ransomNote = `aaaa` and magazine = `aa`\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:\\n        ransomNote_arr = sorted([*ransomNote])\\n        mag_arr = sorted([*magazine])\\n        \\n        n, m = len(ransomNote_arr), len(mag_arr)\\n        i = j = 0\\n        \\n        while i < n and j < m:\\n            while j+1 < m and mag_arr[j] < ransomNote_arr[i]:\\n                j += 1\\n            \\n            if ransomNote_arr[i] != mag_arr[j]:\\n                return False\\n            \\n            i += 1\\n            j += 1\\n        \\n        # We can exhaust magazine without building the whole ransomNote, hence we check if we arrived to end\\n        return i == n\\n```\\n\\n# More food for thought\\n\\n* You could optimize the hashmap solution by using 1 hashmap. One iteration counts the magazine character occurrences, while the second iteration decrements from that counter the amount of times the keys occurred in ransomNote.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\nHave a great and productive day!",

                "content": "# Approach\\nThe given code is a Java implementation of a method called `canConstruct`, which checks whether a ransom note can be constructed from a given string called magazine. The method takes two strings as input: `ransomNote` representing the ransom note and `magazine` representing the available magazine text.\\n\\nLet\\'s go through the code step by step:\\n\\n1. `if (ransomNote.length() > magazine.length()) return false;`\\n   - This line checks if the length of the `ransomNote` is greater than the length of the `magazine`. If it is, it means that there are not enough characters in the magazine to construct the ransom note, so the method returns `false`.\\n\\n2. `int[] alphabets = new int[26];`\\n   - This line declares and initializes an integer array called `alphabets` with a length of 26. This array will be used to count the occurrence of each character in the magazine.\\n\\n3. `for (char c : magazine.toCharArray()) alphabets[c-\\'a\\']++;`\\n   - This line iterates over each character `c` in the `magazine` string. The `toCharArray()` method converts the string into an array of characters.\\n   - For each character, it increments the corresponding index in the `alphabets` array. It uses `c-\\'a\\'` to calculate the index, where `c` represents the character and `\\'a\\'` represents the ASCII value of the lowercase letter \\'a\\'. This way, the characters \\'a\\' to \\'z\\' will be mapped to indices 0 to 25.\\n\\n4. `for (char c : ransomNote.toCharArray()) {`\\n   - This line starts a loop that iterates over each character `c` in the `ransomNote` string.\\n\\n5. `if (alphabets[c-\\'a\\'] == 0) return false;`\\n   - This line checks if the count of the character `c` in the `alphabets` array is zero. If it is, it means that there are not enough occurrences of this character in the magazine to construct the ransom note. In this case, the method returns `false`.\\n\\n6. `alphabets[c-\\'a\\']--;`\\n   - This line decreases the count of the character `c` in the `alphabets` array by one. It represents using one occurrence of this character from the magazine to construct the ransom note.\\n\\n7. Finally, if the code reaches this point without returning `false`, it means that all characters in the ransom note can be constructed using the available characters in the magazine. Hence, the method returns `true`.\\n\\nThe overall logic of the code is to count the occurrences of each character in the magazine using an array. Then, for each character in the ransom note, it checks if there are enough occurrences in the magazine to construct the note. If there is any character missing, it returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true` at the end.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {\\n        if (ransomNote.length() > magazine.length()) return false;\\n        int[] alphabets = new int[26];\\n        \\n        for(char c:magazine.toCharArray()){\\n            alphabets[c-\\'a\\']++;\\n        }\\n        for(char c:ransomNote.toCharArray()){\\n            if( alphabets[c-\\'a\\']==0 ) return false;\\n            alphabets[c-\\'a\\']--;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\nPlease upvote if you like the solution.\\nHappy Coding! \\uD83D\\uDE0A",

The size of the map will be equal to the number of distinct characters in the ransomNote string, which is at most m. Therefore, the space complexity of the function is proportional to the size of the mpp map, which is O(m).\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) \\n    {\\n        int m = ransomNote.size();\\n        int n = magazine.size();\\n\\n        unordered_map <char, int> mpp;\\n        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)\\n            mpp[ransomNote[i]]++;\\n\\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)\\n            mpp[magazine[i]]--;\\n\\n        for(auto x: mpp)\\n        {\\n            if(x.second > 0)\\n                return false;\\n        }\\n        return true;        \\n    }\\n};\\n```",

                "content": "To begin with, the whole problem is equivalent to solving the following equation with smallest `k`  (assuming `k >= 2` and `m >= 1`): \\n\\n  `f(k, m) = n`\\n\\nwhere `k` is the base of the numbers, `m` is the number of digit `1`\\'s in this base, `f(k, m) = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1) = (k^m - 1)/(k-1)` is the numeric value of the number in base `10`, and `n` is the numeric value of the given input string in base `10`. \\n\\nBefore we jump into solutions of the equation, let\\'s first dig up some properties of the function `f(k, m) = (k^m - 1)/(k-1)`.\\n\\n1. If `m` is fixed, `f(k, m)` is monotonically increasing on `k`.\\n2. If `k` is fixed, `f(k, m)` is also monotonically increasing on `m`.\\n\\nNow suppose we have two different solutions for the above equation: `(k1, m1)` and `(k2, m2)`. Without loss of generality, let\\'s assume `m1 > m2`, then we can show `k1 < k2` as follows: `n = f(k2, m2) = f(k1, m1) > f(k1, m2) ==> k2 > k1`. Similarly for the other case: `m1 < m2 ==> k1 > k2`. Therefore `k` and `m` will be inversely related provided the equation is held true.\\n\\nThe conclusion above suggests that if we can simply find a solution to the equation `f(k, m) = n` with the largest possible `m`, then the corresponding `k` is guaranteed to be the smallest. So now we need to figure out the upper and lower limit on `m` to impose constraint on our searching range. (Strictly speaking, we may also proceed in the other way round, i.e., to find the smallest `k` directly but that turns out to be `O(n)`.)\\n\\nNote that if the equation is held true, smaller `k` will correspond to larger `m`. Since the minimum of `k` is `2`, we know the maximum of `m` will be `log(n + 1)` (logarithm of `(n+1)` in base `2`). What about the lower limit? Note that `n >= 3`, therefore `m` cannot be `1` (otherwise the numeric value would be `1` and the equation will have no solutions). To summarize, we have: `2 <= m <= log(n + 1)`.\\n\\nSo our solution will go like this, starting from the upper limit of `m`, check if we can find a `k` so that the equation  `f(k, m) = n` is held true. If so, return the corresponding `k` as the solution. Otherwise decrease the value of `m` by `1` and repeat the process until either a solution is found or all values of `m` have been exhausted. Note that for any `n >= 3`, there is a trivial solution where `k = n - 1 and m = 2`, therefore our searching process above is guaranteed to find at least one solution.\\n\\nThe last part is how to find the solution to the equation with `m` fixed. A straightforward way would be doing binary search. One point worth noting here is the upper and lower limits for the searching range of `k`. For the upper limit, note that `n = f(k, m) = 1 + k + ... + k^(m-1) > k^(m-1) ==> k < n^(1/(m-1))`. For the lower limit, note that `n = f(k, m) = (k^m - 1)/(k-1) <= (k^m - 1) ==> k >= (n+1)^(1/m)`. To summarize:  `(n+1)^(1/m) <= k <= n^(1/(m-1))`.\\n\\nSo here comes our final solution based on the analyses above. Note that the range of the input `n` is `[3, 10^18]`, so `n` can fit into a `long` type variable. Also if for each `m`,  `k` is in the searching range specified above, we won\\'t have overflow problem. As for the time complexity, in the worst case, we need to scan the whole range of `m`, which is `O(logn)`; for each `m`, the binary search is `O(logn)` too; therefore our solution will run at `O((logn)^2)`.  \\n\\n```\\npublic String smallestGoodBase(String n) {\\n    long num = Long.valueOf(n);\\n        \\n    for (int m = (int)(Math.log(num + 1) / Math.log(2)); m > 2; m--) {\\n        long l = (long)(Math.pow(num + 1, 1.0 / m));\\n        long r = (long)(Math.pow(num, 1.0 / (m - 1)));\\n        \\t\\n        while (l <= r) {\\n            long k = l + ((r - l) >> 1);\\n            long f = 0L;\\n            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++, f = f * k + 1);\\n        \\t\\t\\n            if (num == f) {\\n        \\treturn String.valueOf(k);\\n            } else if (num < f) {\\n        \\tr = k - 1;\\n            } else {\\n        \\tl = k + 1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n        \\n    return String.valueOf(num - 1);\\n}\\n```",

It\\'s short and fast, but how does it work?\\n\\nLet\\'s do baby steps.\\n\\nWhat is `111` in base 2?\\n\\nthat is `1x2^0 + 1x2^1 + 1x2^2 = 1x1 + 1x2 + 1x4 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7`\\n\\nwhat is `111` in base 5?\\n\\nthat is `1x5^0 + 1x5^1 + 1x5^2 = 1x1 + 1x5 + 1x25 = 1 + 5 + 25 = 31`\\n\\nGuess what ... this is a classic  geometric sequence. Check out Wikipedia under Geometric progression.\\n\\nGood news - there is a very simple formula to calculate the total:\\n\\nif our base is r and the starting element is 1, the sum (in our case it\\'s n):\\n\\n`n = (1 - k^m)/(1 - k)`\\n\\nHere n is our number n, k is the base and m is the number of digits in the string representing n in base k\\n\\nThis is the key part, once you get comfortable with that, the rest is more or less easy. \\n\\nOk, so if you look at that formula, we only know n, we need to find k, but we also don\\'t know m. Since we have 2 variables and one equasion, we can\\'t calculate k analytically, but since the number of digits can\\'t be too long, we can simply try a range of possible bases.\\n\\nSo how can we determine the range? Let\\'s see ... the smaller the base, the longer the number representation - that is obvious if you remember how numbers look in hex (base 16, shorter than in decimal) vs in binary format (base 2, much longer!). That means if we got number n, the longest possible string to represent it would be with base 2. And the way to calculate the number of digits is log(n,2). (so if k=log(n,2), that means n = 2 ^ k, so that tells us the highest number we can represent with that many digits)\\n\\nWe can quickly calculate that number using:\\n\\n```\\n        m_max = int(math.log(n, 2))\\n```\\n\\nOk, so far so good. Now we can go back to the formula:\\n\\n`n = (1 - k^m)/(1 - k)`\\n\\nwe know the number n and that m is in the range from 1 to m_max. \\n\\nHow can we find k? Now we are going to do the following trick.\\n\\nSince k is the base, it\\'s going to be an integer.  So the idea is we get an estimate using non-exact calculation and then we verify if that k works or not using a percise verification formula.\\n\\nIf you look at \\n\\n`n = (1 - k^m)/(1 - k)`\\n\\nOnce k and m become large numbers, we can ignore them and then `n ~ k^m/k`, so we can use `k = int(n**(1/m))` as an approximate value for k. Now, this is important. Remember, we said \"once k and m become large numbers\"? This estmate works better for the large numbers than for the small ones. So when we\\'ll run our loop, we\\'ll go from the large values of m down.\\n\\nOk, so once we have an estimated k, we simply plug it into the formula above and verify. Here is another tip. That formula has division in it. Division makes things complicated. First, now we are going to be using floats in addition to ints. Second, comparing int and float is hard. So we can simply stay with int numbers only by changing that formula to:\\n\\n`if (k**m - 1 ) == n*(k - 1)`\\n\\nOk, now we got the final catch. Remember `k = int(n**(1/m))` ? There is another problem with division. We can\\'t divide by zero. So we need to exclude that.\\n\\nFinally, if nothing else works, any number can be presented as 11 using base n-1. For example, 3 is 11 base 2, 11 is 11 base 10, 17 is 11 base 16 etc. ( more formally n = 1x(n-1)^1+1x(n-1)^0 = 1x(n-1) + 1x1 = n -1 + 1 = n)\\n\\nGreat, now we just need to put all pieces together:\\n\\n```\\n    def smallestGoodBase(self, n: \\'str\\') -> \\'str\\':\\n        n = int(n) # <- thanks to Python\\'s unlmited int size, we can simply convert the input string into int.\\n        m_max = int(math.log(n, 2)) # <- here we estimate the max number of digits we would need.\\n        \\n        for m in range(m_max, 1, -1): # <- we are going to check if we can form the number n with that many digits ...\\n            k = int(n**(1/m)) # <- estimating the base by rounding the float to an int\\n            if (k**(m+1) - 1)  == n*(k-1): # <- and here we are verifying accurately if that base would work\\n                return str(k) # <- return if yes\\n        return str(n-1)  # <- if nothing else worked, we can always represent as 11 in base (n-1)\\n```\\n\\nYes!

                "content": "**Key Observation:** if `N` in base `k >= 2` has all digits as `1`'s, that means `n` has representation\\n* `n = ` &Sigma;<sub>p=0:d-1</sub> `k`<sup>p</sup>,\\n\\nwhere `d` is the number of digits in base `k`. So **the problem is equivalent to** \\n* find smallest `k >= 2` such that function `f(k,d)` := &Sigma;<sub>p=0:d-1</sub> `k`<sup>p</sup> - `N` = `0` for some integer `d`.\\n\\nAs many fellow coders have posted the popular binary search solution for root of `f(*, d)` with some fixed `d`, but I think the search bound for `d` and `k` should be tightened as much as possible to speed up the algorithm.\\n\\n**Range of d:** Note that `f(k,d)` is strictly increasing in `k`, which means `f(*,d)` has most one root for a fixed `d`. \\nNote that `f` can be rewritten as \\n* `f(k,d)` = (`k`<sup>d</sup>`-1`)/(`k-1`)`-N` &ge; `f(2,d)` = `2`<sup>d</sup>`-1-N`,\\n\\nso we must have `d` &le; `log2(N+1)` to be able to have a root for `f(*,d)`.\\n\\n**Range of k:** for a fixed `d`, we have\\n* `f(k,d)` = (`k`<sup>d</sup>`-1`)/(`k-1`)`-N` < `k`<sup>d</sup>`-N`,\\n\\nso we must have the root `k` > `N`<sup>1/d</sup>.\\nWe also have\\n* `f(k,d)` = &Sigma;<sub>p=0:d-1</sub> `k`<sup>p</sup> - `N` > `k`<sup>d-1</sup>`-N`,\\n\\nso we must have the root `k` < `N`<sup>1/(d-1)</sup>.\\n\\n**Summary:** we loop `d` only in range `[2, log2(N+1)]` reversely, and for each `d`, we binary search root for `f(*,d)` only in range `[N`<sup>1/d</sup>, `N`<sup>1/(d-1)</sup>`]`.\\n```\\n    int64_t N; // =stoll(n)\\n    \\n    string smallestGoodBase(string n) {\\n      for (int64_t k, d=log2((N=stoll(n))+1); d>1;) if (k = root(d--)) return to_string(k);\\n    }\\n    \\n    int64_t f(int64_t k, int64_t d) { // f(k,d) = sum k^i - N\\n      for (int64_t i=0, p=1, sum=1; i<d; sum += p*=k) if (++i == d) return sum-N;\\n    }\\n    \\n    int64_t root(int64_t d) { // binary search root for f(*,d) in range [N^1/d, N^1/(d-1)]\\n      int64_t m, v, L = pow(N, 1./d), R = pow(N, 1./(d-1));\\n      for (; L <= R; v<0? L = m+1 : R = m-1) if (!(v = f(m=(L+R)/2,d))) return m;\\n      return d>2? 0 : N-1;\\n    }\\n```\\n**Time Complexity:** \\n* The loop in `smallestGoodBase` has length `log N`.\\n* Apparently, function `f(k,d)` has `O(d)` complexity.\\n* In binary search `root`, we have `O(d*log(R-L)) = O(d*log R) = O(d*log N`<sup>1/(d-1)</sup>`) = O(log N)`.\\n\\nSo the overall time complexity is `O(log N)`<sup>2</sup>. (`N = stoll(n)`)\\n\\n**Improvement for Function `root`:** \\nActually, as @StefanPochmann pointed out in this [post](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/76368/python-solution-with-detailed-mathematical-explanation-and-derivation/4) with binomial theorem, only `int64_t k = pow(N, 1./(d-1))` could be the candidate for the root of `f(*,d)`. So method `root` can be simplified as following:\\n```\\n    int64_t root(int64_t d) { // only N^1/(d-1) could be root for f(*,d)\\n      int64_t k;\\n      return d>2? f(k = pow(N,1./(d-1)), d)? 0 : k : N-1;\\n    }\\n```\\nThe overall time complexity still stands as `O((log N)^2)`.",

As the base increases - from 2 to 8 to 16 in this\\nexample - the length of the binary string decreases.  From this we can infer\\nthat N must be less than or equal to ```len(bin(n)) - 2```.

                "content": "Intuition:\\nThe problem asks us to find the smallest possible base k such that the sum of geometric series starting from 1 and going up to k^(m-1) equals n. We can see that the value of k must lie between 2 and n^(1/(m-1)), since the sum of the geometric series is an increasing function of k. We can use this observation to perform a binary search over the possible values of k and find the smallest good base.\\n\\nApproach:\\n1. Convert n to a long integer and iterate over the possible values of m, starting from the highest possible value and working our way down.\\n2. Initialize the left and right boundaries of the binary search to 2 and n^(1/(m-1))+1, respectively.\\n3. Perform a binary search over the range [left, right] to find the smallest possible value of k that could be a good base. At each step of the binary search, compute the value of the sum of geometric series for the given k, and compare it with n.\\n4. If the sum of geometric series is equal to n, return k as the answer.

                "content": "Intuition:\\nTo find the smallest base in which a given number `n` can be expressed as a sum of at least two positive integers, we need to find the largest possible value of `m` (the number of summands) and the smallest possible value of `k` (the base) that satisfies the equation `n = (k^m) + (k^(m-1)) + ... + k + 1`. We can then check if the sum of the geometric series with `m+1` terms and first term `1` and common ratio `k` is equal to `n`. If it is, then `k` is a valid base for `n`. We can use binary search on the value of `m` to find the largest possible value of `m`, and then use a formula to compute the corresponding value of `k`. \\n\\nApproach:\\nThe `smallestGoodBase` function uses a loop to iterate over possible values of `m` in decreasing order, starting from the largest possible value of `m` (which is `int(math.log(n, 2))`), and ending at 2 (inclusive). For each value of `m`, the function computes the corresponding value of `k` using the formula `k = int(n ** m ** -1)`. It then checks if `k` is a valid base for `n` by computing the sum of the geometric series with `m+1` terms and common ratio `k`, and checking if it is equal to `n`. If a valid base is found, the function returns it as a string. If no valid base is found, the function returns `n-1` as a string.\\n\\nTime complexity:\\nThe time complexity of the `smallestGoodBase` function is `O(log^2(n))`. This is because the loop over possible values of `m` runs for `log(n)` iterations, and for each iteration, the computation of `k` and the check for a valid base takes `log(n)` time. Therefore, the total time complexity is `O(log(n) * log(n))`.\\n\\nSpace complexity:\\nThe space complexity of the `smallestGoodBase` function is `O(1)`, as it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the variables `m` and `k`, and does not create any additional data structures.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nimport math\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    def smallestGoodBase(self, n: str) -> str:\\n        # Convert input string to integer\\n        n = int(n)\\n        \\n        # Loop over possible values of m in decreasing order\\n        for m in range(int(math.log(n, 2)), 1, -1):\\n            # Compute k using the formula k = (n^(1/m)), rounded down to the nearest integer\\n            k = int(n ** m ** -1)\\n            \\n            # Check if k is a valid base for n\\n            if (k ** (m + 1) - 1) // (k - 1) == n:\\n                # If so, return k as a string\\n                return str(k)\\n        \\n        # If no valid base is found, return n - 1 as a string\\n        return str(n - 1)\\n\\n```",

This equals k+1 in our formula.\\nWe use linear search (from highest power to lowest power) to find the highest power and therefore lowest base that satisfies the equation(all variables have to be integers, so we can\\'t use binary search here).\\nFor each power use binary search between 2 and n to find if any value of \"r\" satisfies our equation. If not, then we decrease our power by one and try again. \\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(logn.logn)$$\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:$$O(1)$$\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def smallestGoodBase(self, n: str) -> str:\\n        #uplimit denotes the upper limit of power i.e. k+1\\n        uplimit=ceil(log(int(n)+1,2))\\n        print(uplimit)\\n        p=uplimit\\n        while p>1:\\n            left=2\\n            right=int(n)\\n            #index=-1\\n            while left<=right:\\n                mid=(left+right)//2\\n                temp=((mid**p)-1)//(mid-1)\\n                if temp==int(n):return str(mid)\\n                elif temp<int(n):left=mid+1\\n                else:right=mid-1\\n            p-=1\\n        return \"\"\\n```",

Choose to delete the one which requires minimum deletion to equalize `word1[:i-2] and word2[:j-1]` or `word1[:i-1] and word2[:j-2]` which would be stored in *`dp[i - 1][j]`* and *`dp[i][j - 1]`* respectively.\\n\\nFinally, we will return *`dp[L1][L2]`* which will denote the minimum number of deletions required to equalize whole *`word1`* and *`word2`*.\\n\\n**C++**\\n```\\nint minDistance(string& word1, string& word2) {        \\n\\tvector<vector<int> >dp(size(word1) + 1, vector<int>(size(word2) + 1));\\n\\tfor(int i = 0; i <= size(word1); i++) \\n\\t\\tfor(int j = 0; j <= size(word2); j++) \\n\\t\\t\\tif(!i || !j) dp[i][j] = i + j; // if one word == \"\", all other characters of other word need to be deleted\\n\\t\\t\\t//                if characters match        ?  dont delete     : 1 deletion + min to equalize after deletion of (word1[i], word2[j])\\n\\t\\t\\telse dp[i][j] = word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1] ? dp[i - 1][j - 1] : 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);\\n\\treturn dp[size(word1)][size(word2)];\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Python**\\n```\\ndef minDistance(self, w1: str, w2: str) -> int:\\n\\tdp = [[1000]*(len(w2)+1) for i in range(len(w1)+1)]\\n\\tfor i in range(len(w1) + 1):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(len(w2) + 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tdp[i][j] = i + j if i == 0 or j == 0 else dp[i - 1][j - 1] if w1[i - 1] == w2[j - 1] else 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\\n\\treturn dp[-1][-1]\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Java**\\n```java\\npublic static int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {\\n    int[][] dp = new int[word1.length() + 1][word2.length() + 1];\\n    for (int i = 0; i <= word1.length(); i++) \\n        for (int j = 0; j <= word2.length(); j++) \\n            if (i == 0 || j == 0) \\n                dp[i][j] = i + j;\\n            else if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) \\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];\\n            else \\n                dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);                            \\n\\n    return dp[word1.length()][word2.length()];\\n}\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** **`O(L1*L2)`** \\n***Space Complexity :*** **`O(L1*L2)`**\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u2714\\uFE0F ***Solution - IV (Space-Optimized Dynamic Programming)***\\n\\nIn the above solution, we can see that we are **only ever accessing the current row and previous row of the *`dp`*** array.

If you like this solution or find it useful,* ***please upvote*** *this post.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Idea:***\\n\\nThis problem is basically asking us to identify the **longest common subsequence** (**LCS**) between the two words (**W1, W2**). The answer will then be the combined difference between the length of the words and the length of the LCS.\\n\\nFor a typical LCS solution, we would use a **bottom-up** **dynamic programming** (**DP**) approach and use nested loops to compare each letter of each word against each other (**W1[i], W2[j]**). This would normally call for a DP array of size **(m + 1) * (n + 1)**, where **m = W1.length** and **n = W2.length**. Since the LCS process references the previous row and column for the target cell, we\\'ll need the extra buffer of **0**-filled cells. Each cell in the DP array at **dp[i][j]** will represent the longest subsequence found between **W1.substr(0,i)** and **W2.susbtr(0,j)**. Our final answer will then be **dp[m][n]**.\\n\\nSince the DP array is being built iteratively, in order, we can reduce the normal **space complexity** from **O(N * M)** by only keeping the current and last rows (**dpCurr, dpLast**) as we iterate through. This will drop the space complexity to **O(N)**. Doing this, we can also ensure that the shorter word is used for **N** by swapping the two words if necessary.\\n\\n - _**Time Complexity: O(N * M)** where **N** and **M** are the lengths of the two words_\\n - _**Space Complexity: O(N)** where **N** is the length of the smaller of the two words_\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Implementation:***\\n\\nJavascript and Java will find it easier to iterate repeatedly through an array rather than a string, so we can initially **split()** or **toCharArray()** the two words (**WA1, WA2**).\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Javascript Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **96ms / 40.2MB** (beats 100% / 100%).\\n```javascript\\nvar minDistance = function(W1, W2) {\\n    let m = W1.length, n = W2.length\\n    if (m < n) [W1, W2, m, n] = [W2, W1, n, m]\\n    let WA1 = W1.split(\"\"), WA2 = W2.split(\"\"),\\n        dpLast = new Uint16Array(n + 1),\\n        dpCurr = new Uint16Array(n + 1)\\n    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {\\n        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) \\n            dpCurr[j+1] = WA1[i] === WA2[j]\\n                ? dpLast[j] + 1\\n                : Math.max(dpCurr[j], dpLast[j+1]);\\n        [dpLast, dpCurr] = [dpCurr, dpLast]\\n    }\\n    return m + n - 2 * dpLast[n] \\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Python Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **196ms / 14.0MB** (beats 100% / 100%).\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def minDistance(self, W1: str, W2: str) -> int:\\n        m, n = len(W1), len(W2)\\n        if m < n: W1, W2, m, n = W2, W1, n, m\\n        dpLast, dpCurr = [0] * (n + 1), [0] * (n + 1)\\n        for c1 in W1:\\n            for j in range(n):\\n                dpCurr[j+1] = dpLast[j] + 1 if c1 == W2[j] else max(dpCurr[j], dpLast[j+1])\\n            dpLast, dpCurr = dpCurr, dpLast\\n        return m + n - 2 * dpLast[n]\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Java Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **3ms / 38.6MB** (beats 100% / 100%).\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int minDistance(String W1, String W2) {\\n        int m = W1.length(), n = W2.length();\\n        if (m < n) {\\n            String tempStr = W1;\\n            W1 = W2;\\n            W2 = tempStr;\\n            int tempInt = n;\\n            n = m;\\n            m = tempInt;\\n        }\\n        char[] WA1 = W1.toCharArray(), WA2 = W2.toCharArray();\\n        int[] dpLast = new int[n+1], dpCurr = new int[n+1];\\n        for (char c1 : WA1) {\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) \\n                dpCurr[j+1] = c1 == WA2[j]\\n                    ? dpLast[j] + 1\\n                    : Math.max(dpCurr[j], dpLast[j+1]);\\n            int[] tempArr = dpLast;\\n            dpLast = dpCurr;\\n            dpCurr = tempArr;\\n        }\\n        return m + n - 2 * dpLast[n];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***C++ Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **4ms / 6.6MB** (beats 99% / 99%).\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int minDistance(string W1, string W2) {\\n        int m = W1.size(), n = W2.size();\\n        if (m < n) swap(W1, W2), swap(n, m);\\n        vector<int> dpLast(n+1, 0), dpCurr(n+1, 0);\\n        for (char c1 : W1) {\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) \\n                dpCurr[j+1] = c1 == W2[j]\\n                    ? dpLast[j] + 1\\n                    : max(dpCurr[j], dpLast[j+1]);\\n            swap(dpLast, dpCurr);\\n        }\\n        return m + n - 2 * dpLast[n];\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Assume we have two strings \"seat\", \"ocean\" and '#' denotes to empty position.\\n1. We first create a matrix of (n + 1) * (m+1) where n is the length of word1 and m is the length of word2. The reason why we need to plus 1 is so we can handle some edge case like when the first character is the same. \\n\\\\# | \\\\# | s | e | a | t\\n\\\\# | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n o | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n c | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n e | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n a | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n n | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n2. We start comparing word1 and word2. In this case, we first calculate the first row. Since o is not equal to any character in \"seat\", the length of longest common subsequence will be zeron. Same case for character c.\\n\\\\# | \\\\# | s | e | a | t\\n\\\\# | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n **o | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0**\\n **c | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0**\\n e | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n a | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n n | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n3. We now calculate row 'e'. e doesn't equal to s, so the length of LCS is 0.\\n\\\\# | \\\\# | s | e | a | t\\n\\\\# | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n o | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n c | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n e | 0 | **0** | 0 | 0 | 0\\n a | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n n | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n=> Now, we compare 'e' with 'se', since the character is the same, we now the length of LCS between \"se\" and \"oce\" is the length of LCS between \"s\" and \"oc\" plus one. That's why we have this code:\\n ```\\nif (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {\\n  matrix[i][j] = matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;} \\n```\\nNow, the matrix becomes the following:\\n\\\\# | \\\\# | s | e | a | t\\n\\\\# | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n o | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n c | 0  | **0** | 0 | 0 | 0\\n e | 0 | 0 | **1** | 0 | 0\\n a | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\n n | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\\nNext, we compare c with a, since 'e' doesn't equal to 'a', we then know that, the length of LCS between 'oce' and 'sea' is the larger one of LCS('coe', 'se') and LCS('oc', 'sea').That's why we have the else statement written as below:\\n```\\nelse {\\n  matrix[i][j] = Math.max(matrix[i - 1][j], matrix[i][j - 1]);\\n}\\n```\\nThere are plenty of videos explaning LCS online, I didn't include the part about how to actually find the subsequence here since we only care about the length of the LCS.\\nHope this will help.",

If you like this solution or find it useful,* ***please upvote*** *this post.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Idea:***\\n\\nThis problem is basically asking us to identify the **longest common subsequence** (**LCS**) between the two words (**W1, W2**). The answer will then be the combined difference between the length of the words and the length of the LCS.\\n\\nFor a typical LCS solution, we would use a **bottom-up** **dynamic programming** (**DP**) approach and use nested loops to compare each letter of each word against each other (**W1[i], W2[j]**). This would normally call for a DP array of size **(m + 1) * (n + 1)**, where **m = W1.length** and **n = W2.length**. Since the LCS process references the previous row and column for the target cell, we\\'ll need the extra buffer of **0**-filled cells. Each cell in the DP array at **dp[i][j]** will represent the longest subsequence found between **W1.substr(0,i)** and **W2.susbtr(0,j)**. Our final answer will then be **dp[m][n]**.\\n\\nSince the DP array is being built iteratively, in order, we can reduce the normal **space complexity** from **O(N * M)** by only keeping the current and last rows (**dpCurr, dpLast**) as we iterate through. This will drop the space complexity to **O(N)**. Doing this, we can also ensure that the shorter word is used for **N** by swapping the two words if necessary.\\n\\n - _**Time Complexity: O(N * M)** where **N** and **M** are the lengths of the two words_\\n - _**Space Complexity: O(N)** where **N** is the length of the smaller of the two words_\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Implementation:***\\n\\nJavascript and Java will find it easier to iterate repeatedly through an array rather than a string, so we can initially **split()** or **toCharArray()** the two words (**WA1, WA2**).\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Javascript Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **96ms / 40.2MB** (beats 100% / 100%).\\n```javascript\\nvar minDistance = function(W1, W2) {\\n    let m = W1.length, n = W2.length\\n    if (m < n) [W1, W2, m, n] = [W2, W1, n, m]\\n    let WA1 = W1.split(\"\"), WA2 = W2.split(\"\"),\\n        dpLast = new Uint16Array(n + 1),\\n        dpCurr = new Uint16Array(n + 1)\\n    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {\\n        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) \\n            dpCurr[j+1] = WA1[i] === WA2[j]\\n                ? dpLast[j] + 1\\n                : Math.max(dpCurr[j], dpLast[j+1]);\\n        [dpLast, dpCurr] = [dpCurr, dpLast]\\n    }\\n    return m + n - 2 * dpLast[n] \\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Python Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **196ms / 14.0MB** (beats 100% / 100%).\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def minDistance(self, W1: str, W2: str) -> int:\\n        m, n = len(W1), len(W2)\\n        if m < n: W1, W2, m, n = W2, W1, n, m\\n        dpLast, dpCurr = [0] * (n + 1), [0] * (n + 1)\\n        for c1 in W1:\\n            for j in range(n):\\n                dpCurr[j+1] = dpLast[j] + 1 if c1 == W2[j] else max(dpCurr[j], dpLast[j+1])\\n            dpLast, dpCurr = dpCurr, dpLast\\n        return m + n - 2 * dpLast[n]\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***Java Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **3ms / 38.6MB** (beats 100% / 100%).\\n```java\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int minDistance(String W1, String W2) {\\n        int m = W1.length(), n = W2.length();\\n        if (m < n) {\\n            String tempStr = W1;\\n            W1 = W2;\\n            W2 = tempStr;\\n            int tempInt = n;\\n            n = m;\\n            m = tempInt;\\n        }\\n        char[] WA1 = W1.toCharArray(), WA2 = W2.toCharArray();\\n        int[] dpLast = new int[n+1], dpCurr = new int[n+1];\\n        for (char c1 : WA1) {\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) \\n                dpCurr[j+1] = c1 == WA2[j]\\n                    ? dpLast[j] + 1\\n                    : Math.max(dpCurr[j], dpLast[j+1]);\\n            int[] tempArr = dpLast;\\n            dpLast = dpCurr;\\n            dpCurr = tempArr;\\n        }\\n        return m + n - 2 * dpLast[n];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### ***C++ Code:***\\n\\nThe best result for the code below is **4ms / 6.6MB** (beats 99% / 99%).\\n```c++\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int minDistance(string W1, string W2) {\\n        int m = W1.size(), n = W2.size();\\n        if (m < n) swap(W1, W2), swap(n, m);\\n        vector<int> dpLast(n+1, 0), dpCurr(n+1, 0);\\n        for (char c1 : W1) {\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) \\n                dpCurr[j+1] = c1 == W2[j]\\n                    ? dpLast[j] + 1\\n                    : max(dpCurr[j], dpLast[j+1]);\\n            swap(dpLast, dpCurr);\\n        }\\n        return m + n - 2 * dpLast[n];\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Also, we don\\'t need to explicitly delete any characters of the words. We will just denote deleting *`word1[i]`* (case `2.I`) by recursing for *`(i+1)th`* index and deleting *`word2[j]`* (case `2.II`) by recursing for `(j + 1)th` index.\\n\\n**C++**\\n```\\nint minDistance(string& word1, string& word2) {\\n\\treturn solve(word1, word2, 0, 0);\\n}\\n// recursive solver to find minimum deletions to equalize w1 & w2\\nint solve(string w1, string w2, int i, int j) {\\n\\tif(i == size(w1) && j == size(w2)) return 0;  // reached end of both strings -> both strings have been equalized and no further steps required\\n\\tif(i == size(w1)) return size(w2) - j;        // reached end of word1 -> need to delete remaining characters of word2 to equalize\\n    if(j == size(w2)) return size(w1) - i;        // reached end of word2 -> need to delete remaining characters of word1 to equalize\\n\\tif(w1[i] == w2[j]) return solve(w1, w2, i + 1, j + 1);  // no deletion required since the characters already match\\n\\t// 1 current character deletion + min(after deleting w1[i], after deleting w2[j])\\n\\treturn 1 + min(solve(w1, w2, i + 1, j), solve(w1, w2, i, j + 1));\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Python**\\n\\n```\\ndef minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:\\n\\tdef solve(w1, w2, i, j):\\n\\t\\tif i == L1 and j == L2 : return 0\\n\\t\\tif i == L1 or j == L2 : \\n\\t\\t\\treturn max(L1 - i, L2 - j)\\n\\t\\tif w1[i] == w2[j] : \\n\\t\\t\\treturn solve(w1, w2, i + 1, j + 1)                \\n\\t\\treturn 1 + min(solve(w1, w2, i + 1, j), solve(w1, w2, i, j + 1))\\n\\tL1, L2 = len(word1), len(word2)\\n\\treturn solve(word1, word2, 0, 0)   \\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** **`O(2^L1 + 2^L2)`**, where *`L1`* is the length of string *`word1`* and *`L2`* is the length of string *`word2`*.

This is because we can reach  same *`(i, j)`* index pair in multiple ways. But the answer to equalize *`word1[i:]`* (characters from index `i` till end) and *`word2[j:]`* (characters from index `j` till end) will always remain the same.\\n\\nThus, we can avoid the recomputations by using Dynamic Programming. We will maintain a 2D DP array where *`dp[i][j]`* will denote the number of steps required to equalize `word1[i:]` and `word2[j:]`.\\n\\nAll the steps remain the same as the brute force solution.

Again, we will maintain a 2D DP array where *`dp[i][j]`* will denote the number of steps required to equalize *`word1[:i]`* (characters from index 0 till `i`) and *`word2[:j]`* (characters from index 0 till `j`).\\n\\n1. In the start, if `i == 0` or `j == 0`, one string is of length 0 and we have no choice but to delete all characters from the other string to equalize them both.\\n\\n2. If *`word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`*, we don\\'t need to delete any of these characters at current index. The answer would just be the number of optimal deletions required to equalize *`word1[:i-1]`* and *`word2[:j-1]`* which would be stored in *`dp[i - 1][j - 1]`*\\n\\n\\n3. If *`word1[i-1] != word2[j-1]`*, we can delete either of the two characters. Choose to delete the one which requires minimum deletion to equalize `word1[:i-2] and word2[:j-1]` or `word1[:i-1] and word2[:j-2]` which would be stored in *`dp[i - 1][j]`* and *`dp[i][j - 1]`* respectively.\\n\\nFinally, we will return *`dp[L1][L2]`* which will denote the minimum number of deletions required to equalize whole *`word1`* and *`word2`*.\\n\\n**C++**\\n```\\nint minDistance(string& word1, string& word2) {        \\n\\tvector<vector<int> >dp(size(word1) + 1, vector<int>(size(word2) + 1));\\n\\tfor(int i = 0; i <= size(word1); i++) \\n\\t\\tfor(int j = 0; j <= size(word2); j++) \\n\\t\\t\\tif(!i || !j) dp[i][j] = i + j; // if one word == \"\", all other characters of other word need to be deleted\\n\\t\\t\\t//                if characters match        ?  dont delete     : 1 deletion + min to equalize after deletion of (word1[i], word2[j])\\n\\t\\t\\telse dp[i][j] = word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1] ? dp[i - 1][j - 1] : 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);\\n\\treturn dp[size(word1)][size(word2)];\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Python**\\n```\\ndef minDistance(self, w1: str, w2: str) -> int:\\n\\tdp = [[1000]*(len(w2)+1) for i in range(len(w1)+1)]\\n\\tfor i in range(len(w1) + 1):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(len(w2) + 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tdp[i][j] = i + j if i == 0 or j == 0 else dp[i - 1][j - 1] if w1[i - 1] == w2[j - 1] else 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\\n\\treturn dp[-1][-1]\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** **`O(L1*L2)`** \\n***Space Complexity :*** **`O(L1*L2)`**\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u2714\\uFE0F ***Solution - IV (Space-Optimized Dynamic Programming)***\\n\\nIn the above solution, we can see that we are **only ever accessing the current row and previous row of the *`dp`*** array. So, we don\\'t really need to maintain the whole dp array and the solution can be optimized to suffice with the use of only 2 rows.\\n\\nA common and very easy trick to optimze space in such DP solutions is to declare two rows of `dp` and alternate between these rows on each iteration. We can easily alternate between the rows by doing a parity check - use row 0 for odd indices and 1 for even indices.\\n\\nSo, the only change to optimze the space in solution solution is to declare a two row dp matrix and **AND** (`&`) row index of dp with 1 to alternate between rows.\\n\\n**C++**\\n```\\nint minDistance(string& word1, string& word2) {        \\n\\tvector<vector<int> >dp(2, vector<int>(size(word2) + 1));\\n\\tfor(int i = 0; i <= size(word1); i++) \\n\\t\\tfor(int j = 0; j <= size(word2); j++) \\n\\t\\t\\tif(!i || !j) dp[i & 1][j] = i + j;\\n\\t\\t\\telse dp[i & 1][j] = word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1] ? dp[(i - 1) & 1][j - 1] : 1 + min(dp[(i - 1) & 1][j], dp[i & 1][j - 1]);\\n\\treturn dp[size(word1) & 1][size(word2)];\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Python**\\n```\\ndef minDistance(self, w1: str, w2: str) -> int:\\n\\tdp = [[1000]*(len(w2)+1) for i in range(2)]\\n\\tfor i in range(len(w1) + 1):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(len(w2) + 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tdp[i & 1][j] = i + j if i == 0 or j == 0 else dp[(i - 1) & 1][j - 1] if w1[i - 1] == w2[j - 1] else 1 + min(dp[(i - 1) & 1][j], dp[i & 1][j - 1])\\n\\treturn dp[len(w1) & 1][-1]\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** **`O(L1*L2)`** \\n***Space Complexity :*** **`O(L2)`**\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\u2714\\uFE0F ***Solution - V (Slight optimization from Solution - IV)***\\n\\nA final small bit of optimzation that can be added to above solution is swapping the strings if `len(word2)` > `len(word1)` which will ensure that space complexity will be fully minimized.\\n\\n\\n**C++**\\n```\\nint minDistance(string& word1, string& word2) {        \\n    if(size(word1) < size(word2)) swap(word1, word2);\\n\\tvector<vector<int> >dp(2, vector<int>(size(word2) + 1));\\n\\tfor(int i = 0; i <= size(word1); i++) \\n\\t\\tfor(int j = 0; j <= size(word2); j++) \\n\\t\\t\\tif(!i || !j) dp[i & 1][j] = i + j;\\n\\t\\t\\telse dp[i & 1][j] = word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1] ? dp[(i - 1) & 1][j - 1] : 1 + min(dp[(i - 1) & 1][j], dp[i & 1][j - 1]);\\n\\treturn dp[size(word1) & 1][size(word2)];\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Python**\\n```\\ndef minDistance(self, w1: str, w2: str) -> int:\\n\\tif len(w1) < len(w2) : w1, w2 = w2, w1\\n\\tdp = [[1000]*(len(w2)+1) for i in range(2)]\\n\\tfor i in range(len(w1) + 1):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(len(w2) + 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tdp[i & 1][j] = i + j if i == 0 or j == 0 else dp[(i - 1) & 1][j - 1] if w1[i - 1] == w2[j - 1] else 1 + min(dp[(i - 1) & 1][j], dp[i & 1][j - 1])\\n\\treturn dp[len(w1) & 1][-1]\\n```\\n\\n***Time Complexity :*** **`O(L1*L2)`** \\n***Space Complexity :*** **`O(min(L1, L2))`**\\n\\n---\\n---\\n\\n\\uD83D\\uDCBB\\uD83D\\uDC31\\u200D\\uD83D\\uDCBBIf there are any suggestions / questions / mistakes in my post, please do comment below \\uD83D\\uDC47 \\n\\n---\\n---\\n",

                "content": "This is a problem that IMHO should rated as hard, since it requires at least 2 different patterns (branching from a graph to get the different characters and DP) with a twist.\\n\\nIn order to tackle it, we will declare at class level `dp` as a pointer to a pointer of an `int` and then initialise it in the main function for it to be referring to a 2 dimensional array with `w1.size()` rows of `w2.size()` elements each, all initialised to be `INT_MAX` to mark them as untouched.\\n\\nFocusing on the graph part, we will solve it with `dfs`, which initially will be passed only the 2 input strings and will also take as optional parameters 2 pointers `i` and `j` (for characters in `w1` and `w2`, respectively), both defaulted to `0` (ie: to point to the first character of each string). In this function we will check all the possibilities we can get to :\\n* first we are going to declare 2 support variables `l1` and `l2` with the leftover characters to parse in each string;\\n* we do so since we want to check if we are done parsing either string (ie: either `i` or `j` match the length of their respective string) and if so, we know that we have to just remove all the leftover characters in the other string (and thus if we ended up parsing both string at the same time, we would just `return` `0` here);\\n* then we activate our memoisation super power and check if we already encountered this scenario - the most efficient solution for these very same `i` and `j` and if so (said value is `!= INT_MAX`), we can just `return` it;\\n* then we have the case where `i` and `j` point to the same character: in this case no replacement needs to be done (ie: no character needs to be skipped) and we can `return` a recursive call to `dfs` after increasing both of them;\\n* the last, general case is when `i` and `j` point to different characters, in which case we will store in `dp[i][j]` `1` (since we know at least one character has to be removed here), plus the minimum value between a recursive call increasing `i` (ie: skipping/ignoring the current character) and a recursive call increasing `j`.\\n\\nAt the end of our calls, we will be returning the smaller possible value to make the string equal, without actually having to generate any.\\n\\nThe code:\\n\\n```cpp\\nclass Solution {\\n    int **dp;\\npublic:\\n    int dfs(string &w1, string &w2, int i = 0, int j = 0) {\\n        // support variables\\n        int l1 = w1.size() - i, l2 = w2.size() - j;\\n        // end case: finished parsing at least one string\\n        if (!l1 || !l2) {\\n            // no character to be removed if both are finished, otherwise we remove the remaining ones\\n            return max(l1, l2);\\n        }\\n        // looking for already stored value\\n        if (dp[i][j] != INT_MAX) return dp[i][j];\\n        // matching characters case: no removal on either string\\n        if (w1[i] == w2[j]) return dfs(w1, w2, ++i, ++j);\\n        // general case: computing and memoising it\\n        return dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dfs(w1, w2, i + 1, j), dfs(w1, w2, i, j + 1));\\n    }\\n    int minDistance(string w1, string w2) {\\n        // resizing dp\\n        dp = new int*[w1.size()];\\n        for (int i = 0, lmt = w1.size(); i < lmt; i++) {\\n            dp[i] = new int[w2.size()];\\n            fill(dp[i], dp[i] + w2.size(), INT_MAX);\\n        }\\n        return dfs(w1, w2);\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

What essentially happens is that we *pull*  the length of the longest subsequence seen so far and increase it by 1.

If the characters at the current positions in s1 and s2 are equal (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]), then update curr[j] to be 1 + prev[j-1]. This means the current character contributes to the length of the common subsequence.\\n\\nb. If the characters are not equal, update curr[j] based on the maximum value from either the previous row (prev[j]) or the current row\\'s previous column (curr[j-1]). This represents the scenario where we skip a character in one of the strings to maximize the common subsequence length.\\n\\nAfter processing each row in s1, copy the values from curr to prev to prepare for the next iteration.\\n\\nOnce all iterations are done, the value in prev[m] will represent the length of the longest common subsequence between s1 and s2.\\n\\nFinally, return the minimum number of deletions required to make the two strings identical, which is calculated as (n + m - 2 * prev[m]).\\n## Code Below :)\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def minDistance(self,s1: str, s2: str) -> int:\\n        n=len(s1)\\n        m=len(s2)\\n        prev=[0 for i in range(m+1)] \\n        curr=[0 for i in range(m+1)] \\n        for i in range(1,n+1):\\n            for j in range(1,m+1):\\n                if s1[i-1]==s2[j-1]:\\n                    curr[j]=1+prev[j-1]\\n                else:\\n                    curr[j]=max(prev[j],curr[j-1])\\n            prev=curr[:]\\n        return (n+m-2*prev[m])\\n                \\n```\\n\\n### Please UPVOTE it :)\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/de6bee59-2333-4dc9-8c58-2282190ecec3_1691498375.2770379.jpeg)\\n",

The memoization table, represented by the dp vector, is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.\\n- SC (Space Complexity): The space complexity of the LCS function with memoization is O(m * n) because it uses a 2D matrix (DP) to store intermediate results. The size of the matrix is determined by the lengths of the input strings. Additionally, the minDistance function uses the dp matrix, which contributes to the space complexity. However, since the DP matrix is reused for subproblems, the overall space complexity is still O(m * n).\\n\\n\\n### code 1\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\nprivate:\\n    int lcs(int m, int n, string s, string t, vector<vector<int>> &dp) {\\n        if(m == 0 || n == 0) return 0;\\n        if(dp[m][n] != -1) return dp[m][n];\\n        if(s[m-1] == t[n-1])\\n            return dp[m][n] = 1 + lcs(m-1, n-1, s, t, dp);\\n        return dp[m][n] = max(lcs(m, n-1, s, t, dp), lcs(m-1, n, s, t, dp));\\n    }\\npublic:\\n    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {\\n        int m=word1.size(), n=word2.size();\\n        vector<vector<int>> dp(m+1, vector<int>(n+1, -1));\\n        return m+n-2*lcs(m, n, word1, word2, dp);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n### code 2\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\nprivate:\\n    int lcs(int m, int n, string &s, string &t, vector<vector<int>> &dp) {\\n        if(m == 0 || n == 0) return 0;\\n        if(dp[m][n] != -1) return dp[m][n];\\n        if(s[m-1] == t[n-1])\\n            return dp[m][n] = 1 + lcs(m-1, n-1, s, t, dp);\\n        return dp[m][n] = max(lcs(m, n-1, s, t, dp), lcs(m-1, n, s, t, dp));\\n    }\\npublic:\\n    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {\\n        int m=word1.size(), n=word2.size();\\n        vector<vector<int>> dp(m+1, vector<int>(n+1, -1));\\n        return m+n-2*lcs(m, n, word1, word2, dp);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n*The difference lies in the usage of the string parameter in the LCS function. In the first code snippet, string s is passed by value, meaning a copy of the string is made for each recursive call. In contrast, the second code snippet uses string& s, passing the string by reference. This means that the second code snippet avoids making unnecessary copies of the string during recursion, potentially reducing memory usage and improving efficiency.*\\n\\n**While this difference can have some impact on performance, it is relatively minor compared to the presence of memoization in the second code snippet. The main efficiency improvement comes from the use of memoization, which avoids redundant calculations and reduces the overall time complexity of the algorithm.**\\n\\n---\\n---\\n\\n# Dp\\n## Complexity\\n- TC (Time Complexity): The time complexity of the updated code is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings. The code uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to calculate the length of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between the two strings. It iterates over each character in both strings once, filling the dp matrix with the lengths of the LCS for various substrings. Since each cell in the matrix is filled based on previous computations, the overall time complexity is O(m * n).e.\\n- SC (Space Complexity): The space complexity of the updated code is O(m * n) because it uses a 2D matrix (DP) of size (m+1) x (n+1) to store the lengths of the LCS for different substrings. Each cell in the matrix represents a subproblem and stores the length of the LCS up to that point. Therefore, the space required is proportional to the lengths of the input strings. The rest of the variables and data structures used in the code have constant space requirements.\\n### code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {\\n        int m=word1.size(), n=word2.size();\\n        vector<vector<int>> dp(m+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));\\n        for(int i=1; i<=m; i++) {\\n            for(int j=1; j<=n; j++) {\\n                if(word1[i-1] == word2[j-1])\\n                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1];\\n                else\\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return m+n-2*dp[m][n];\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n# Happy Coding \\uD83D\\uDE80",

We know this is possible. To accomplish this, the max number of operations will be performing would be deleting all the characters of string1 and then later adding all the characters of string2 to string1. But to find out the minimum number of operations, we would have to retain longest common subsequence in string1 and string2. Then, we would be performing our insertions accoding to the need.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nWrite the function for finding out the longest common subsequence. Then the number of deletions in string1 would be string1.size() - lcs(string1, string2). And number of insertions would be string2.size()-lcs(string1, string2). And giving out the number of insertions plus deletions in  this case would give the number of minimum oprations required for doing this change. \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(N*M)---There are two nested loops.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(N*M)---We are using an external array of size (N*M).
