Now we should fill the block of \"S(i) = S(i)\" and \"S(i) = S(i+1)\", the basic case that **we can\\'t find any substring in it**. Then with this matrix, we can decide if a string is palindromic by if **its substring is palindromic** and if **its start letter equals end letter**.\\n\\nThe image below is a matrix for string \"abbc\". For example, start with the first \"b\" and end with \"c\" tells if substring \"bbc\" is palindromic. What we need to do next is filling the \"??\" block, only half of the matrix is used.\\n![image](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/users/rongxiantian/image_1531322500.png)\\n\\nAfter initialization, we can decide if a string is palindromic by its substring and newly added letters, shown below.\\n![image](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/users/rongxiantian/image_1531321812.png)\\nIf we want to decide the block pointed by the arrow(\\\\\"abb\\\\\"), we should look up [b,b], which is substring \"b\", and see if (\"a\"==\"b\").

This gives us a nudge to look for a pattern and hence we go for DP.\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\nLets see both the approaches one by one !!!\\n\\n1.)`Brute Force:` Instead of directly going to code and finding a problem later, lets stop and think about the concept we intend to use here .\\n\\n*Concept:* We will go through **all** possible element in string and find the longest palindrome amongst them.\\n\\n*Review:* To calculate **all** the possible substrings in a string of length `n` ,number of combinations generated are:\\n`1+2+3+4+..........n`=`n(n-1)/2`. \\n`==>` To check all the substrings for Palindrome, we will have to go through **all the `n` characters**\\n`==>` **Total** Combinations: `n*n(n-1)/2`= `O(n^3)`\\n\\n*Conclusion:* Since the time complexity is `O(n^3)`, hence we will not discuss on this approach, and our energy would be better spent looking at `DP` solution .\\n\\n2.)`DP:` Instead of going through all the previous Palindromes again and again, how about we save them somewhere and calculate the new ones based on them, but how do we d that? Lets see it below \\n \\n*Concept:* To check a Palindrome of length ,say `l`,  we just have to check if \\ni.) `s[first character]==s[last character]`\\nii.) `s[first character+1, last charcter -1]` is a Palindrome\\n\\nFor example : say s=\" balab\"\\nNow, to check , if \"s\" is Palindrome or not, we just have to look at\\ni.) `s[first character]==s[last character]` -> b==b -> True\\nii.)`s[first character+1, last charcter -1]` is a Palindrome --> \"aba\" is a Palindrome??\\nTo check for \"aba\", a==a--> True , and \"b\" is a Palindrome(of length 1)\\n==> `s` is a Plaindrome\\n\\n*Review:* We will make a table `dp` containing if the string from `left` to `right` is a Pal. or not, and to do that, we will fill in the table with `1` or `0`.\\nLets look at an example of how the table looks like for `s:\"geeks\"`\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/cccbc507-96ac-45d8-a3fb-9658fc007fc7_1616569419.1798341.png)\\n\\nFor `s:geeks:` \\n`dp[i][i]`=1, as single letters are always Palindromes\\n`dp[1][2]` : string from starting position 1 to ending position 2 are Pal. or not (since \"ee\" is, hence we fill the table with \"1\") \\nand likewise for others.\\n\\nThis reduces our time from `O(n^3)` to `O(n^2)` as we dont have to check every possible combination now, instead we can directly check the value being 1 or 0.\\n\\n**Code:**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n     string longestPalindrome(string s) \\n{   \\n    int len = s.size();\\n    int dp[len][len];\\n    memset(dp,0,sizeof(dp));\\n    int end=1;\\n    int start=0;\\n\\t\\n    for(int i=0;i<len;i++)\\n    {\\n        dp[i][i] = 1;\\n    }\\n    for(int i=0;i<len-1;i++)\\n    {\\n        if(s[i]==s[i+1])\\n        { dp[i][i+1]=1;start=i;end=2;}\\n    }\\n    \\n    for(int j=2;j<len;j++)\\n    {\\n        for(int i=0;i< len-j;i++)\\n        {  \\n            int left=i; //start point\\n            int right = i+j;  //ending point\\n            \\n            if(dp[left+1][right-1]==1 && s[left]==s[right]) \\n            {\\n                dp[left][right]=1; start=i; end=j+1; \\n            }        \\n        }\\n    }\\n   return s.substr(start, end);\\n}\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIf you liked this post, please **UPVOTE** \\nHappy coding :))",

So to make sure this also happens in bottoms up, it is important to reverse the direction.\\n\\nThis is true for ALL dynamic programming problems.\\n\\nAnother hint is because the main equation has `memo[left][right] = memo[left + 1][right - 1]; `\\n\\nThis means, before `left` can be computed `left+1` must be precomputed. So left goes from `n,n-1,...0`.\\n\\nAlso, before `right` can be computed `right-1` must be precomputed.So right goes `0,1,2....n`.\\n\\nHope it helps.",

For any given substring, we can confirm if it is a palindrome in `O(1)` time if:\\n1. The characters at the ends of the substring are the same.\\n2. If the inner substring is a palindrome.\\n\\nObserve this relationship below:\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/861e5558-0a38-4d01-bc08-aeb135cb80bd_1655340599.097208.png)\\n\\n___\\n### Algorithm:\\nOur outter loop will represent our length - 1, `len`.\\nOur inner loop will represent our left pointer, `i`.\\nTherefore, our right pointer will be represented by `i+len`. This makes our logic a bit easier:\\n* Our base cases are when `len` is 0 or 1 (i.e. when the length of the substring is of length 1 or 2). In these situations, DP won\\'t work. Thankfully, all we need to check for is whether `s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + len)`. \\n* For `len > 1`, we would also need to check whether the inner substring is a palindrome as illustrated above. Therefore, we\\'ll also check if `dp[i+1][i+len-1]` is true.\\n\\nThere are a few ways we could keep track of our longest substring. We could just assign a new substring whenever our current window length is greater than the current string\\'s length. However, assigning a new substring on each update takes `O(n)` time at worst. Therefore, we\\'ll just keep track of the indices of our longest substring using `start` and `end` and we\\'ll only convert this into a substring at the end.\\n\\nAwesome, we now have everything we need to start coding!\\n___\\n### Code:\\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or improvements, feel free to let me know. Thanks for reading!\\n```java\\npublic String longestPalindrome(String s) {\\n\\tint n = s.length(), start = 0, end = 0;\\n\\tboolean[][] dp = new boolean[n][n];\\n\\n\\tfor (int len=0; len<n; len++) {\\n\\t\\tfor (int i=0; i+len<n; i++) {\\n\\t\\t\\tdp[i][i+len] = s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i+len) && (len < 2 || dp[i+1][i+len-1]);\\n\\t\\t\\tif (dp[i][i+len] && len > end - start) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstart = i;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tend = i + len;\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\treturn s.substring(start, end + 1);\\n}\\n```\\n**Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`\\n**Space Complexity:** `O(n^2)`\\n> Note: DP is NOT a space-optimal solution. However, I believe the dynamic relationship is quite an important relationship to know when tackling palindrome questions as it quite heavilly applies to questions outside this one. If you use DP in an interview for this question, that should be more than enough to pass the question :)",

A palindrome is a string that is the same when read from both ends. For example, \"racecar\" is a palindrome because it is the same when read from left to right and right to left.\\n\\n# Approach:\\n1. We start by iterating through all possible substrings of the given string using two nested loops, i and j, where i represents the starting index and j represents the ending index of the substring.\\n2. For each substring, we check if it is a palindrome or not by using a helper function check(), which takes the starting and ending indices of the substring and returns true if it is a palindrome and false otherwise.\\n3. If the substring is a palindrome, we update the maximum length of palindromic substring seen so far and the starting index of this substring.\\n4. After iterating through all possible substrings, we return the longest palindromic substring.\\n\\n# Complexity:\\n- Time Complexity: The time complexity of the above solution is O(n^3) because we have two nested loops and for each substring, we check whether it\\'s a palindrome or not using another loop. In the worst case, the check function will be called for each substring, which takes O(n) time, making the overall time complexity O(n^3).\\n- Space Complexity: The space complexity of the solution is O(1) because we are not using any additional space apart from a few integer variables to keep track of the longest palindromic substring seen so far.\\n---\\n# C++\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    bool check(string &s, int i, int j){\\n        while(i<j){\\n            if(s[i] != s[j]){\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n            i++;\\n            j--;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }            \\n    string longestPalindrome(string s) {\\n        int n = s.size();\\n        int starting_index = 0;\\n        int max_len = 0;\\n        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){\\n            for(int j=i; j<n; j++){\\n                if(check(s, i, j)){\\n                    if(j-i+1 > max_len){\\n                        max_len = j-i+1;\\n                        starting_index = i;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return s.substr(starting_index, max_len);\\n    }\\n}; \\n```\\n\\n---\\n# JAVA\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public boolean check(String s, int i, int j){\\n        while(i<j){\\n            if(s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j)){\\n                return false;\\n            }\\n            i++;\\n            j--;\\n        }\\n        return true;\\n    }            \\n    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        int starting_index = 0;\\n        int max_len = 0;\\n        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){\\n            for(int j=i; j<n; j++){\\n                if(check(s, i, j)){\\n                    if(j-i+1 > max_len){\\n                        max_len = j-i+1;\\n                        starting_index = i;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return s.substring(starting_index, starting_index+max_len);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n---\\n# Python\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def check(self, s, i, j):\\n        while i<j:\\n            if s[i] != s[j]:\\n                return False\\n            i += 1\\n            j -= 1\\n        return True\\n    \\n    def longestPalindrome(self, s):\\n        n = len(s)\\n        starting_index = 0\\n        max_len = 0\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            for j in range(i, n):\\n                if self.check(s, i, j):\\n                    if j-i+1 > max_len:\\n                        max_len = j-i+1\\n                        starting_index = i\\n        return s[starting_index:starting_index+max_len]\\n\\n```\\n---\\n# JavaScript\\n```\\nvar check = function(s, i, j) {\\n    while (i < j) {\\n        if (s[i] !== s[j]) {\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n        i++;\\n        j--;\\n    }\\n    return true;\\n}\\n\\nvar longestPalindrome = function(s) {\\n    const n = s.length;\\n    let starting_index = 0;\\n    let max_len = 0;\\n    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {\\n            if (check(s, i, j)) {\\n                if (j - i + 1 > max_len) {\\n                    max_len = j - i + 1;\\n                    starting_index = i;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return s.substring(starting_index, starting_index + max_len);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n# 2. Better Approach\\n# Intuition:\\nA Better approach is to use dynamic programming to solve the problem. We can define a two-dimensional boolean array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring s[i:j+1] is a palindrome or not. We can then fill in the dp array starting with substrings of length 1 and 2, and then use these values to fill in the values for longer substrings. We can keep track of the longest palindrome substring found so far and return it at the end.\\n\\n\\n# Approach:\\n\\n1. Create a two-dimensional boolean array dp of size n x n, where n is the length of the input string s. Initialize all values of dp to false.\\n\\n2. Iterate over the string s and mark all substrings of length 1 as palindromes, i.e., set dp[i][i] to true for all i from 0 to n-1. Also, initialize a string variable ans to the first character of the input string s and a variable maxLength to 1.\\n\\n3. For substrings of length 2 and greater, iterate over all possible substring lengths len from 2 to n. For each length, iterate over all possible starting indices i from 0 to n-len. Calculate the ending index j as j = i + len - 1.\\n\\n4. If s[i] == s[j], then check if the substring s[i+1:j] is a palindrome by checking if dp[i+1][j-1] is true. If it is true or len == 2, then set dp[i][j] to true and update ans and maxLength if the current substring is longer than the current longest palindrome substring.\\n\\n5. After filling in the dp array, return the string variable ans, which contains the longest palindrome substring found.\\n\\n\\n# Complexity:\\n\\n- Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of the input string. This is because we are filling in a two-dimensional boolean array of size n x n and checking each substring only once.\\n\\n- Space Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of the input string. This is because we are using a two-dimensional boolean array of size n x n to store the intermediate results.\\n\\n# C++\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    string longestPalindrome(string s) {\\n        int n = s.size();\\n        vector<vector<bool>> dp(n, vector<bool>(n, false));\\n        string ans = \"\";\\n        int maxLength = 0;\\n        \\n        // Base case: all substrings of length 1 are palindromes\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            dp[i][i] = true;\\n            ans = s[i];\\n            maxLength = 1;\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Fill in the dp table for substrings of length 2 and greater\\n        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n-len+1; i++) {\\n                int j = i+len-1;\\n                if (s[i] == s[j]) {\\n                    if (len == 2 || dp[i+1][j-1]) {\\n                        dp[i][j] = true;\\n                        if (len > maxLength) {\\n                            ans = s.substr(i, len);\\n                            maxLength = len;\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n# Python\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def longestPalindrome(self, s):\\n        n = len(s)\\n        dp = [[False for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\\n        ans = \"\"\\n        maxLength = 0\\n        \\n        # Base case: all substrings of length 1 are palindromes\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            dp[i][i] = True\\n            ans = s[i]\\n            maxLength = 1\\n        \\n        # Fill in the dp table for substrings of length 2 and greater\\n        for length in range(2, n+1):\\n            for i in range(n-length+1):\\n                j = i+length-1\\n                if s[i] == s[j]:\\n                    if length == 2 or dp[i+1][j-1]:\\n                        dp[i][j] = True\\n                        if length > maxLength:\\n                            ans = s[i:i+length]\\n                            maxLength = length\\n        \\n        return ans\\n\\n```\\n---\\n# JAVA\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[n][n];\\n        String ans = \"\";\\n        int maxLength = 0;\\n\\n        // Base case: all substrings of length 1 are palindromes\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n            dp[i][i] = true;\\n            ans = s.substring(i, i+1);\\n            maxLength = 1;\\n        }\\n\\n        // Fill in the dp table for substrings of length 2 and greater\\n        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n-len+1; i++) {\\n                int j = i+len-1;\\n                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {\\n                    if (len == 2 || dp[i+1][j-1]) {\\n                        dp[i][j] = true;\\n                        if (len > maxLength) {\\n                            ans = s.substring(i, i+len);\\n                            maxLength = len;\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n---\\n# JavaScript\\n```\\nvar longestPalindrome = function(s) {\\n    var n = s.length;\\n    var dp = Array.from({length: n}, () => Array(n).fill(false));\\n    var ans = \"\";\\n    var maxLength = 0;\\n\\n    // Base case: all substrings of length 1 are palindromes\\n    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n        dp[i][i] = true;\\n        ans = s[i];\\n        maxLength = 1;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Fill in the dp table for substrings of length 2 and greater\\n    for (var len = 2; len <= n; len++) {\\n        for (var i = 0; i < n-len+1; i++) {\\n            var j = i+len-1;\\n            if (s[i] == s[j]) {\\n                if (len == 2 || dp[i+1][j-1]) {\\n                    dp[i][j] = true;\\n                    if (len > maxLength) {\\n                        ans = s.substring(i, i+len);\\n                        maxLength = len;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    return ans;\\n};\\n\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 3. Optimal Approach\\n# Intuition:\\nThe given code aims to find the longest palindrome in a given string. It uses a two-pointer approach to expand around each center and checks if the characters on both sides are equal. The variable `minstart` keeps track of the starting index of the longest palindrome found so far, and `maxlen` stores its length.\\n\\n# Approach:\\n1. Initialize variables `minstart` and `maxlen` as 0 to keep track of the longest palindrome found so far.\\n2. Iterate over each character in the string using a variable `i`.\\n3. Check if the remaining length from `i` to the end of the string is less than half of the `maxlen`. If it is, there is no possibility of finding a longer palindrome, so we break out of the loop.\\n4. Set `l` and `r` as `i`, representing the left and right pointers of the potential palindrome.\\n5. While `r` is within the string bounds and the character at `r` is equal to the next character, increment `r`.\\n6. Update `i` to be `r + 1` since all the characters from `l` to `r` have been accounted for.\\n7. While `l` is greater than 0 and `r` is within the string bounds, and the characters at `l-1` and `r+1` are equal, decrement `l` and increment `r`.\\n8. Calculate the length of the potential palindrome using `newlen = r - l + 1`.\\n9. If `newlen` is greater than `maxlen`, update `maxlen` with `newlen` and `minstart` with `l`.\\n10. After the loop finishes, return the substring of `s` starting from `minstart` with length `maxlen`, which represents the longest palindrome found in the string.\\n\\n# Complexity:\\n- Time Complexity: The code uses a two-pointer approach to expand around each center, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.\\n- Space Complexity: The code uses a constant amount of extra space, resulting in a space complexity of O(1).\\n# C++\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    string longestPalindrome(string s) {\\n        int n = s.size();\\n        if (n == 0)\\n            return \"\";\\n        if (n == 1)\\n            return s;\\n        \\n        int minstart = 0, maxlen = 0;\\n        \\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ) {\\n            if (n - i < maxlen / 2)\\n                break;\\n            \\n            int l = i, r = i;\\n            \\n            // Find the center of the palindrome\\n            while (r < n && s[r] == s[r + 1])\\n                r++;\\n            \\n            // Update the next starting point\\n            i = r + 1;\\n            \\n            // Expand around the center to find the longest palindrome\\n            while (l > 0 && r < n && s[l - 1] == s[r + 1]) {\\n                l--;\\n                r++;\\n            }\\n            \\n            int newlen = r - l + 1;\\n            if (newlen > maxlen) {\\n                maxlen = newlen;\\n                minstart = l;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return s.substr(minstart, maxlen);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n# JAVA\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        if (n == 0)\\n            return \"\";\\n        if (n == 1)\\n            return s;\\n        \\n        int minstart = 0, maxlen = 0;\\n        \\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ) {\\n            if (n - i < maxlen / 2)\\n                break;\\n            \\n            int l = i, r = i;\\n            \\n            // Find the center of the palindrome\\n            while (r < n - 1 && s.charAt(r) == s.charAt(r + 1))\\n                r++;\\n            \\n            // Update the next starting point\\n            i = r + 1;\\n            \\n            // Expand around the center to find the longest palindrome\\n            while (l > 0 && r < n - 1 && s.charAt(l - 1) == s.charAt(r + 1)) {\\n                l--;\\n                r++;\\n            }\\n            \\n            int newlen = r - l + 1;\\n            if (newlen > maxlen) {\\n                maxlen = newlen;\\n                minstart = l;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return s.substring(minstart, minstart + maxlen);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n# Python\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def longestPalindrome(self, s):\\n        n = len(s)\\n        if n == 0:\\n            return \"\"\\n        if n == 1:\\n            return s\\n        \\n        minstart = 0\\n        maxlen = 0\\n        \\n        i = 0\\n        while i < n:\\n            if n - i < maxlen / 2:\\n                break\\n            \\n            l = i\\n            r = i\\n            \\n            # Find the center of the palindrome\\n            while r < n - 1 and s[r] == s[r + 1]:\\n                r += 1\\n            \\n            # Update the next starting point\\n            i = r + 1\\n            \\n            # Expand around the center to find the longest palindrome\\n            while l > 0 and r < n - 1 and s[l - 1] == s[r + 1]:\\n                l -= 1\\n                r += 1\\n            \\n            newlen = r - l + 1\\n            if newlen > maxlen:\\n                maxlen = newlen\\n                minstart = l\\n        \\n        return s[minstart:minstart + maxlen]\\n\\n```\\n# JavaScript\\n```\\nvar longestPalindrome = function(s) {\\n    const n = s.length;\\n    if (n === 0)\\n        return \"\";\\n    if (n === 1)\\n        return s;\\n\\n    let minstart = 0, maxlen = 0;\\n\\n    let i = 0;\\n    while (i < n) {\\n        if (n - i < maxlen / 2)\\n            break;\\n\\n        let l = i, r = i;\\n\\n        // Find the center of the palindrome\\n        while (r < n - 1 && s[r] === s[r + 1])\\n            r++;\\n\\n        // Update the next starting point\\n        i = r + 1;\\n\\n        // Expand around the center to find the longest palindrome\\n        while (l > 0 && r < n - 1 && s[l - 1] === s[r + 1]) {\\n            l--;\\n            r++;\\n        }\\n\\n        const newlen = r - l + 1;\\n        if (newlen > maxlen) {\\n            maxlen = newlen;\\n            minstart = l;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    return s.substring(minstart, minstart + maxlen);\\n}\\n\\n```",

With odd length, we use `helper(k, k)` for them.\\n2. With even length, we use `helper(k, k+1)` for them.\\n\\n**Complexity** There will be `2n - 1` possible centers and `O(n)` comparison for each of them, so final time complexity is `O(n^2)`. Space complexity is `O(n)`\\n\\n**Further discussion** there is also classical dynamic programming for this problem with also `O(n^2)` complexity, however in practice it can work much slower if we do not do optimiaztions: reason that it will be indeed `n^2` operations, whereas on our approach here we do a lot of early stoppings.

Consider the case `ababa`. If we already knew that `bab` is a palindrome, it is obvious that `ababa` must be a palindrome since the two end letters are the same.\\n\\nSo we can define `dp[i][j]` as `true` if the substring `S(i, j)` is a palindrome.\\n\\nThe recurrence is then obvious: `dp[i][j]` = (`dp[i + 1][j - 1]` && `Si == Sj`)\\n\\nThe base cases are: `dp[i][i]` = `true`, `dp[i][i + 1] = (Si == Si+1)`.\\n\\n![](https://bloggg-1254259681.cos.na-siliconvalley.myqcloud.com/10ayv.jpg)\\n\\n**Note:** Determining ranges of `i` and `j` would be easy if you pick a starting point in the graph to get some intuition.

Check whenever you got maximum substring whether it is palindrome or not. if yes update it.. otherwise skip it.\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    string longestPalindrome(string s) {\\n        int n=s.length();\\n        string s2=s;\\n        reverse(s2.begin(),s2.end());\\n        return LCSS(s,s2,n);\\n    }\\n    string LCSS(string s1, string s2, int n)\\n    {\\n        string ans;\\n        int DP[n+1][n+1],max=0;\\n        for(int i=0; i<=n; ++i)\\n        {\\n            for(int j=0; j<=n; ++j)\\n            {\\n                if(i==0 || j==0)\\n                    DP[i][j]=0;\\n                else if(s1[i-1]==s2[j-1])\\n                {\\n                    DP[i][j]=1+DP[i-1][j-1];\\n                    if(DP[i][j]>max)\\n                    {\\n                        string temp=s1.substr(i-DP[i][j],DP[i][j]);\\n                        string revtemp=temp;\\n                        reverse(revtemp.begin(),revtemp.end());\\n                            if(revtemp==temp)\\n                            {\\n                                max=DP[i][j];\\n                                ans=temp;\\n                            }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                else\\n                    DP[i][j]=0;\\n                \\n            }\\n        }\\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```",

Initializing variables `start` with 0 (Starting index of the longest palindromic substring) and `longlen` with 1, which will contain the length of longest palindromic substring.\\n2. Initially, All substrings of length 1 are palindromic so mark them true.\\n3. then, check Check for substrings of length 2, if `ith` and `i+1th` matches then update `start` with i and `longlen` will be 2.\\n4. Now, Check for substrings of length 3 or more. in this we\\'ll check if the substring from `i` to `j` is a palindrome where `j` is ending index of current substring. \\n5. and then if substring is palindrome then update maxLength`longlen` n `start`.\\n6. Finally, return the string starting from `start`th index till length of `longlen` from Original string , which will contain the longest palindromic substring in the input string.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\ncode uses two nested loops to iterate.\\nO(n^2).\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\ncode uses a 2D boolean table dp of size n x n.\\ntherefore, O(n^2).\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n//bottom-up approach\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    string longestPalindrome(string s) {\\n        int n = s.size();\\n        int start = 0; // Starting index of the longest palindromic substring\\n        int longlen = 1; // Length of the longest palindromic substring (initialize to 1, as each character is a palindrome by itself)\\n        \\n        // Create a table to store the results of subproblems\\n        vector<vector<bool>> t(n, vector<bool>(n, false));\\n        \\n        // All substrings of length 1 are palindromic\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\\n            t[i][i] = true;\\n        \\n        // Check for substrings of length 2\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) \\n        {\\n            if (s[i] == s[i + 1])\\n            {\\n                t[i][i+1] = true;\\n                start = i;\\n                longlen = 2;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Check for substrings of length 3 or more\\n        for (int l = 3; l <= n; l++) \\n        {\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n - l + 1; i++) \\n            {\\n                int j = i + l - 1; // Ending index of the current substring\\n                // Check if the substring from i to j is a palindrome\\n                if (s[i] == s[j] && t[i + 1][j - 1]) \\n                {\\n                    t[i][j] = true;\\n                    if (l > longlen) \\n                    {\\n                        longlen = l;\\n                        start = i;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        //Extract the longest palindromic substring from original string\\n        return s.substr(start, longlen);\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n```",

For even the elements will be side by side.\\n- So we calculate both cases for all elements:\\n    - **For odd**: we took left & right as same elements(central) **`l = i, r = i`**\\n    - if elements in both indexes are the same we\\u2019ll increase `r` & decrease `l` by 1.\\n    - when we find both are not same, we\\u2019ll calculate the length **`length = r-l-1`**\\n    - if the length is greater than mx, then we\\u2019ll store start and end point of this length.\\n    - **For even**: same approach, just here we\\u2019ll take l & r next to each other. **`l = i, r = i+1`**\\n- Return substring from start to max length.\\n- **Time complexity:** O(n^2).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Code:\\n\\n```cpp\\n//Solution 01:\\n****class Solution {\\npublic:\\n    string longestPalindrome(string s) {\\n        int n = s.size();\\n        int start = 0, end = 0, mx = INT_MIN;\\n        \\n        if(n<=1) return s;\\n        \\n        for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++){\\n            int l = i, r = i;\\n            while(l >= 0 && r < n && s[l]==s[r]){\\n                l--; r++;\\n            }\\n            int length = r-l-1;\\n            if(length > mx){\\n                mx = length;\\n                start = l+1;\\n                end = r-1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++){\\n            int l = i, r = i+1;\\n            while(l >= 0 && r < n && s[l]==s[r]){\\n                l--; r++;\\n            }\\n            int length = r-l-1;\\n            if(length > mx){\\n                mx = length;\\n                start = l+1;\\n                end = r-1;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        return s.substr(start, mx);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n> **Please upvote this solution**\\n>",

                "content": "**Introdution:** We will reverse and find the longest plaindrome. I am writing this solution to help anyone who is willing to find how this solution works.\\n\\n**Prerequisite:** Longest Common Subsequence Algorithm[DP]. Here is an easy to understand video of LCS:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSno9rV8Rhg\\n\\n**What about the reverse copy flaw?** OK so this is why you are here. Let\\'s take a lot of examples here.\\n\\n1. s = \"abacdfgdcaba\" and s\\' = \"abacdgfdcaba\". So in this our code will find an answer as \"abacd\" which is correct by LCS point of view but wrong from what we want to do. Lets see.\\n2. So in the reverse string, the starting \\'a\\' in the substring is at index 1(indexing is 1 oriented). Let\\'s find out what it\\'s index was in the original string which is s. OK it\\'s index was 12.\\n3. So in the reverse string, the ending \\'d\\' in the substring is at index 5. Let\\'s find out what it\\'s index was in the original string which is s. OK it\\'s idnex was 8.\\n4. So we see that we are comparing a string which is 8->12(in original of reverse) with a string which is 1->5(in original). If it were a valid substring, it should be on the same index.\\n5. Think this, can it be like \"abcghhcba\" and the substring be \"abc\". No because that is not at the same spot so how it\\'s reverse matters. We want to see the in-place reverse string. Get it? \"aba\" is \"aba\" cool but \"abc\" is not. It\\'s reverse exist which is somewhere but it cannot be a candidate for the plaindrome.\\n6. This situation arrises because of the reverse and LCS. LCS just cares about finding common anywhere. We want common at the same index for it to be a plaindrome.\\n\\n**Let\\'s take a genuine example and clear this**\\n\\n1. s=\"abb\" s\\'=\"bba\". I took it simple but it doesn\\'t matter. \\n2. So our code find \"bb\" as a substring.\\n3. So the start of the first \\'b\\' in the reverse string is 1. The index of it in the original string was 3\\n4. So the start of the second \\'b\\' in the reverse string is 2. The index of it in the original string was 2\\n5. So we are comparing a string of 2->3 with our original string also from 3->2 so this means that this is a genuine solution.\\n6. It\\'s just like \"abcbg\", (substring is \"bab\") then first b is at index 2 and last b is at index 4 then reverse would be \"gbcba\" the first b is at index 4 and the last at 2. They interchange position but index(start and end) don\\'t change.  If they change, there is somthing fishy.\\n\\n**Code:** \\n\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    string longestPalindrome(string s) {\\n        int start = -1; //This is the start of the substring in s(the starting index from 0)\\n        int end = -1; //This is the end of the substring in s(the ending index from 0)\\n        int ans = 0; //This is the length of the longest palindrome\\n        /*\\n        If string is \"abcbr\" then start = 1 and end = 3 and longest palindrome is bcb\\n        */\\n        string srev = string(s.rbegin(),s.rend()); //We reverse the given string and store it\\n        /*\\n        1.

We could try reducing the 2D array to 1D array.\\nSince the outer for loop is `for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)` (the index i has a decreasing order), we could notice that we only need to maintain a 1D array for index j, or using `dp[j-1]` to update dp[j]. To do so, we need the inner for loop's index j to also go backward from n-1 to i. In this way, **when we use `dp[j-1]` to update `dp[j]`, `dp[j-1]` is actually the same as 2D array's `dp[i+1][j-1]`, where i+1 is from the last for loop. The reason for index j's decreasing order is to make sure we do not modify the value of `dp[j-1]` before we use `dp[j-1]` to update `dp[j]`.**\\n\\n**The optimized DP solution: time O(n^2), space O(n)**\\n```java\\npublic static String longestPalindrome(String s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        String result = \"\";\\n        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n];\\n\\n        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\\n            for (int j = n - 1; j >= i; j--) { // decreasing order\\n                // dp[j-1] is the same as dp[i+1][i-1]\\n               // since both dp[j-1] and dp[i+1][j-1] are from the last iteration of the outer loop\\n                dp[j] = s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) && (j - i < 3 || dp[j-1]);\\n                if(dp[j] && (result.equals(\"\") || j - i + 1 > result.length())) {\\n                    result = s.substring(i, j+1);\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return result;\\n    }\\n```",

                "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\n# Expand around Center Approach\\nUse each character of input as middle, and expand both side to find the palindrome.\\nKeep track of length and starting index of longest palindrome found.\\n\\n# Upvote if it helped \\uD83D\\uDE0A\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n1. Initialize two variables: `start` to keep track of the starting index of the longest palindrome found so far, and `max` to keep track of its length. Initially, both are set to 0.\\n\\n2. Check the length of the input string `s`. If it has a length less than 2, return it immediately as it\\'s already a palindrome (or an empty string).\\n\\n3. Convert the input string `s` into a character array `chars` to make it easier to manipulate.\\n\\n4. Iterate through each character in the string using a for loop. For each character at index `i`, do the following:\\n\\n   - **Find odd-length palindromes**: Call the `findPalindrome` function with the current character as both the left and right center (i.e., `findPalindrome(chars, i, i)`). This function will expand outwards from this center to find the longest palindrome centered at this character.\\n\\n   - **Find even-length palindromes**: Call the `findPalindrome` function with the current character and the next character as the left and right centers (i.e., `findPalindrome(chars, i, i+1)`). This covers the case of even-length palindromes.\\n\\n5. The `findPalindrome` function takes a character array `chars` and two indices `j` and `k` as input. It uses these indices to expand outwards from the center and checks if the characters at `j` and `k` are equal. If they are equal, it means a longer palindrome is found, so it expands further by incrementing `k` and decrementing `j`. This process continues until the characters at `j` and `k` are no longer equal or until `j` becomes negative or `k` goes beyond the length of the string.\\n\\n6. Inside the `findPalindrome` function, if a palindrome longer than the previously recorded maximum is found, it updates the `max` variable with the new length and the `start` variable with the new starting index of the longest palindrome.\\n\\n7. After iterating through the entire string and calling `findPalindrome` for all possible centers, the `start` and `max` variables will hold the starting index and length of the longest palindromic substring in the input string.\\n\\n8. Finally, use the `start` and `max` values to extract the longest palindromic substring from the original input string `s` and return it.\\n# Example\\n\\n**Example Input String**: \"babad\"\\n\\n1. character array: `chars = [\\'b\\', \\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'a\\', \\'d\\']`.\\n\\n2. Iterate through the characters in the string:\\n\\n   - **Iteration 1 (i = 0, char = \\'b\\')**:\\n\\n     - Find odd-length palindrome by calling `findPalindrome(chars, 0, 0)`. The center is \\'b\\'.\\n\\n       - Expand outwards: \\'b\\' == \\'b\\'.\\n\\n       - Continue expanding: \\'a\\' != \\'d\\'. Stop.\\n\\n     - Find even-length palindrome by calling `findPalindrome(chars, 0, 1)`. The centers are \\'b\\' and \\'a\\'.\\n\\n       - Expand outwards: \\'b\\' != \\'a\\'. Stop.\\n\\n   - **Iteration 2 (i = 1, char = \\'a\\')**:\\n\\n     - Find odd-length palindrome by calling `findPalindrome(chars, 1, 1)`. The center is \\'a\\'.\\n\\n       - Expand outwards: \\'a\\' == \\'a\\'.\\n\\n       - Continue expanding: \\'b\\' != \\'d\\'. Stop.\\n\\n     - Find even-length palindrome by calling `findPalindrome(chars, 1, 2)`. The centers are \\'a\\' and \\'b\\'.\\n\\n       - Expand outwards: \\'a\\' != \\'b\\'. Stop.\\n\\n   - **Iteration 3 (i = 2, char = \\'b\\')**:\\n\\n     - Find odd-length palindrome by calling `findPalindrome(chars, 2, 2)`. The center is \\'b\\'.\\n\\n       - Expand outwards: \\'b\\' == \\'b\\'.\\n\\n       - Continue expanding: \\'a\\' == \\'a\\'.\\n\\n       - Continue expanding: \\'b\\' != \\'d\\'. Stop.\\n\\n     - Find even-length palindrome by calling `findPalindrome(chars, 2, 3)`. The centers are \\'b\\' and \\'a\\'.\\n\\n       - Expand outwards: \\'b\\' != \\'a\\'. Stop.\\n\\n   - **Iteration 4 (i = 3, char = \\'a\\')**:\\n\\n     - Find odd-length palindrome by calling `findPalindrome(chars, 3, 3)`. The center is \\'a\\'.\\n\\n       - Expand outwards: \\'a\\' == \\'a\\'.\\n\\n       - Continue expanding: \\'b\\' != \\'d\\'. Stop.\\n\\n     - Find even-length palindrome by calling `findPalindrome(chars, 3, 4)`. The centers are \\'a\\' and \\'d\\'.\\n\\n       - Expand outwards: \\'a\\' != \\'d\\'. Stop.\\n\\n   - **Iteration 5 (i = 4, char = \\'d\\')**:\\n\\n     - Find odd-length palindrome by calling `findPalindrome(chars, 4, 4)`. The center is \\'d\\'.\\n\\n       - Expand outwards: \\'d\\' == \\'d\\'.\\n\\n       - No more characters to expand. Stop.\\n\\n     - Find even-length palindrome by calling `findPalindrome(chars, 4, 5)`. The centers are \\'d\\' and out of bounds.\\n\\n       - Out of bounds, so stop.\\n\\n3. After completing the iterations, the `max` variable holds the length of the longest palindrome found (3), and the `start` variable holds the starting index of that palindrome (1).\\n\\n4. Return the substring of the input string using `start` and `max`, which is \"bab\". This is the longest palindromic substring.\\n\\nSo, in this example, the algorithm correctly identifies \"bab\" as the longest palindromic substring, which is both odd and even in length. The algorithm efficiently explores all possible centers to find palindromes and keeps track of the longest one encountered.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(n*n)\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(n)\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    int start = 0; // Initialize the start index for the longest palindrome.\\n    int max = 0;   // Initialize the length of the longest palindrome.\\n\\n    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {\\n        if(s.length() < 2)\\n            return s; \\n\\n        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();\\n\\n        for(int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++){\\n            // Find odd length palindrome\\n            findPalindrome(chars, i, i); // current character as the center of the palindrome\\n\\n            // Find even length palindrome\\n            findPalindrome(chars, i, i+1); // current character and the next character as the centers of the palindrome.\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Return the longest palindromic substring by using the start and max indices.\\n        return s.substring(start, start + max);\\n    }\\n\\n    private void findPalindrome(char[] chars, int j, int k){\\n        // Expand the palindrome by checking characters at indices j and k.\\n        while( j >= 0 && k < chars.length && chars[j] == chars[k]){\\n            j--;\\n            k++;\\n        }\\n        \\n        // Check if the current palindrome length is greater than the previously recorded maximum.\\n        if(max < k - j - 1){\\n            max = k - j - 1;   // Update the length of the longest palindrome.\\n            start = j + 1;     // Update the start index of the longest palindrome.\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```",

                "content": "### Introduction\\n\\nGiven a string `s`, we want to find the longest substring in `s` that is a palindrome.\\nWe can define a palindrome to be the following: **a string with a centre position (which may or may not point to a character in the string) that has a substring `sub` on its left and the reversed substring `sub[::-1]` on its right**. Some examples are shown below:\\n\\n```text\\nOdd-length palindromes (spaced out for clarity)\\n    \"a b c d e d c b a\"   \"r a c e c a r\"\\n             ^                   ^\\n\\nEven-length palindromes (spaced out for clarity)\\n    \" a b c d d b c a\"   \"t o o t\"\\n             ^               ^\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Approach 1\\n\\nBased on the definition above, we can try to find these centre positions in substrings of `s`, since these centre positions will eventually lead us to find the longest palindromic substring. One way is to space out `s` as we did above and check each index. As we noted above, if the index points to a character, then the resulting palindrome is odd-length; if the index points to a space, then the resulting palindrome is even-length.\\n\\nWe can optimise this approach by performing both odd-length and even-length checks on the same index as we iterate through them. At index `i`, **we first assert that `s[i]` is a palindrome of length 1, and iteratively check its adjacent characters for equality until we hit the end(s) of `s`**.\\n\\n```text\\ns = \"abcdedcba\"\\n                      i = 0                 i = 1                 i = 2                 i = 3                 i = 4\\n               \"a b c d e d c b a\"   \"a b c d e d c b a\"   \"a b c d e d c b a\"   \"a b c d e d c b a\"   \"a b c d e d c b a\"\\n                ^                     # ^ #                   # ^ #                   # ^ #             ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\\npalindromes:           \"a\"                   \"b\"                   \"c\"                   \"d\"               \"abcdedcba\"\\n```\\n\\nChecking for even-length palindromes is slightly tricker; **at index `i`, we assert that the (nonexistent) index between `i-1` and `i` is a palindrome of length 0, and we perform the same iteration as described above**.\\n\\n```text\\ns = \"toot\"\\n                 i = 0       i = 1       i = 2\\n               \"t o o t\"   \"t o o t\"   \"t o o t\"\\n               ^            #^#         ^ ^^^ ^\\npalindromes:      \"\"          \"\"        \"toot\"\\n```\\n\\nAfter checking for the longest odd-length and even-length palindromes at index `i`, we store the longest found palindrome to be returned.\\n\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Consider each character in s as the centre of a palindrome.\\n        Check for the longest possible odd-length and even-length palindrome; store the longest palindrome\\n        \"\"\"\\n        # res is the starting index of the longest palindrome\\n        # len_res is the length of the longest palindrome\\n        # len_s is the length of the given string\\n        res, len_res, len_s = 0, 0, len(s)\\n        for i in range(len_s):\\n            # check for palindromes with odd number of characters centred around s[i]\\n            # i.e., s[i] -> s[i-1:i+2] -> s[i-2:i+3] -> ...\\n            # odd is the starting index of the current palindrome with odd number of characters\\n            # len_odd is the length of the current palindrome with odd number of characters\\n            odd, len_odd = i, 1\\n            for j in range(min(i, len_s-i-1)):   # checking indexes [0, i) and [i+1, len_s); take the smaller range\\n                if s[i-j-1] != s[i+j+1]:         # if the two characters adjacent to the ends of the current palindrome are not equal,\\n                    break                        #   a longer palindrome does not exist; break out of the loop\\n                odd, len_odd = odd-1, len_odd+2  # else, a longer palindrome exists; update odd and len_odd to point to that palindrome\\n            # check for palindromes with even number of characters centred around s[i-1:i+1]\\n            # i.e., s[i-1:i+1] -> s[i-2:i+2] -> s[i-3:i+3] -> ...\\n            # even is the starting index of the current palindrome with even number of characters\\n            # len_even is the length of the current palindrome with even number of characters\\n            even, len_even = i, 0\\n            for j in range(min(i, len_s-i)):         # checking indexes [0, i) and [i, len_s); take the smaller range\\n                if s[i-j-1] != s[i+j]:               # if the two characters adjacent to the ends of the current palindrome are not equal,\\n                    break                            #   a longer palindrome does not exist; break out of the loop\\n                even, len_even = even-1, len_even+2  # else, a longer palindrome exists; update even and len_even to point to that palindrome\\n            # update res and len_res to point to the longest palindrome found so far\\n            len_res, res = max((len_res, res), (len_odd, odd), (len_even, even))\\n        return s[res:res+len_res]\\n```\\n\\n**TC: O(n<sup>2</sup>)**; in the worst case, we are iterating through the entirety of `s` in the inner for loop.\\n**SC: O(1)**; no additional data structures used.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Approach 2: Manacher\\'s algorithm\\n\\nI happened to chance upon [this post](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/discuss/2156882/Manacher\\'s-algorithm) that implemented the [Manacher\\'s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring#Manacher\\'s_algorithm), which basically makes use of DP to compute if there is a palindrome at each index.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there\\'s not much explanation I can give since I do not understand the approach too well yet.

                "content": "Solve this problem using a Palindrome Tree, aka an EERTREE! An EERTREE works a lot like a Trie and despite being very obscure and recent, it\\'s quite elegant to solve this problem.\\n\\nSince for a string of length N there are only up to N distinct palindromes, we can represent each one as a node in a Tree.\\n\\nTaking advantage of a palindrome\\'s recursive structure, we create dictionary links to show that one palindrome is just another palindrome with 1 letter concatenated on both sides.  For example, if we had some node that represents the palindrome `\\'aba\\'` and another palindrome `\\'babab\\'`, then we could show that:\\n\\n`aba ----b----> babab`\\n\\nMore formally, the palindrome `X` has an edge labeled `c` to palindrome `Y` when `Y = cXc`.\\n\\nIn addition, you also have one suffix link for each node, which point to it\\'s longest proper suffix that is a palindrome. In other words, `ababa` would point to `aba` because that is the longest proper suffix that is also a palindrome. This is useful because if I am considering the longest palindrome ending at position `i`, I can just find the longest palindrome ending at position `i-1` and descend down the suffix links until I find a palindrome that has a `S[i]` right before it.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s say I had the string `xabacabac` and I am trying to find the longest palindrome ending at the last character. If I know the longest palindrome ending at the character before it is `abacaba` then I just have to check the first palindrome `X` that matches `cXc`.\\n\\n`x[abacaba]c` has `x` right before it which is not equal to `c`, so I go to it\\'s next longest palindromic suffix `aba`\\n\\n`xabac[aba]c` has `c` right before it which is equal to `c` so we have found the palindrome `c[aba]c = cabac`\\n\\nAs for the initialization of our EERTREE, we have 2 nodes to handle the 1 letter and 2 letter palindrome case.\\nThere is the empty string `E` of length 0, such that `cEc = cc`\\nThere is the empty string `I` of length -1, such that `cIc = c`\\n\\nHere\\'s the paper on it:\\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04862\\n\\nHere\\'s a helpful medium article on learning the basics of it:\\nhttps://medium.com/@alessiopiergiacomi/eertree-or-palindromic-tree-82453e75025b\\n\\n```\\nclass Node:\\n    def __init__(self, len, sfx = None):\\n        self.len = len\\n        self.sfx = sfx\\n        self.next = {}\\n        \\nclass Solution:\\n    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:\\n        curr = empty = Node(0, Node(-1))\\n        ans_len = ans_idx = 0\\n        for i, c in enumerate(s):\\n            while i <= curr.len or s[i-1-curr.len] != c:\\n                curr = curr.sfx\\n            if c in curr.next:\\n                curr = curr.next[c]\\n                continue\\n            node = curr.next[c] = Node(curr.len+2, empty)\\n            if node.len > ans_len:\\n                ans_len, ans_idx = node.len, i-node.len+1\\n            if node.len > 1:\\n                curr = curr.sfx\\n                while i <= curr.len or s[i-1-curr.len] != c:\\n                    curr = curr.sfx\\n                node.sfx = curr.next[c]\\n            curr = node\\n        return s[ans_idx:ans_idx+ans_len]\\n```",

                "content": "_Explanation:_\\n\\nThis method uses an expand around center approach. The program iterates through each central point of a potential palindrome. moving left to right in the original input string. It then expands outward (left and right) from the center point and checks if the two characters match. This is done by moving _a_ to the left by one and moving _b_ to the right by one. It keeps doing this until they don\\'t match (i.e. ```s[a] == s[b]``` fails to be true) or either end of the input string is reached. This expansion of the palindrome from its center outward occurs inside of the while loop. Once the while loop exits, we have expanded as far as we could and the length of the palindrome is equal to (b - a - 1). The length of this palindrome is then compared to the current maximum length achieved, stored in M. If it is longer than M, (b - a - 1) becomes the new M (i.e. M = b - a - 1) and the leftmost index of this longest palindrome is stored in x (i.e. x = a + 1).\\n\\nPerhaps the most important (and most challenging) part of the program occurs in the structure of the inner for loop: ```for a,b in [(i,i),(i,i+1)]``` This part may take a little explanation to fully understand. A palindrome can be centered in one of two places. The palindrome _dad_ is centered on one of its letters, specifcally the letter _a_. If you had to pick two indices to describe where the palindrome _dad_ is centered you would say that it was centered at the indices 1 and 1, since 1 is the index of _a_. In general such palindromes (palindromes with an odd number of elements) are centered at (_i_,_i_) for some index _i_. The other type of palindrome, _abba_ is centered in between two identical letters, specifcally it is centered between the letters _b_ and _b_. If you had to pick two indices to describe where the palindrome _abba_ is centered you would say that it was centered at the indices 1 and 2, since 1 and 2 are the indices of the central two _b_\\'s. In general such palindromes (palindromes with an even number of elements) are centered at (_i_,_i+1_) for some index _i_. To correctly look at all the palindrome substrings, for each index _i_ in the for loop we have to consider both centeral pivoting points. This is why the inner for loop iterates through both (_i_,_i_) and (_i_,_i+1_).\\n\\nThe program ends by returning the longest palindrome. This is done by splicing it based on the leftmost index (i.e.  x) of where the palindrome starts and the maximum recorded length (i.e. M).\\n\\n_Glossary of Variables:_\\nL = length of original input string\\nM = length of current longest palindromic substring\\nx = leftmost (starting) index of current longest palindromic substring\\na = number of units left of center of palindrome\\nb = number of units right of center of palindrome\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:\\n\\t    L, M, x = len(s), 0, 0\\n\\t    for i in range(L):\\n\\t    \\tfor a,b in [(i,i),(i,i+1)]:\\n\\t    \\t\\twhile a >= 0 and b < L and s[a] == s[b]: a -= 1; b += 1\\n\\t    \\t\\tif b - a - 1 > M: M, x = b - a - 1, a + 1\\n\\t    return s[x:x+M]\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n- Junaid Mansuri\\n(LeetCode ID)@hotmail.com",

Then, <i>for each</i> of those substrings, we have to check if they are a palindrome.  Since palindromes read the same forwards and backwards, we know that they have to be mirrored across the center.  So one way of testing for palindromes is to start in the middle of the string and work outwards, checking at each step to see if the characters are equal.  Since each palindrome check runs in O(n), the overall algorithm ends up running in O(n<sup>3</sup>) time.\\n\\nInstead, we can reduce this to O(n<sup>2</sup>) time by eliminating some redundant steps.  This is because we can find the longest palindromic substring for <i>all</i> substrings that have the <i>same</i> center in a single O(n) pass.  For example, if the string is `abcdedcfa`, and since we know that `e` is a palindrome by itself, then when we test `ded`, we don\\'t need to start from the center again.  We can only test the outer characters, the `d`.  And when we test `cdedc`, then since we know `ded` is a palindrome, again, we don\\'t need to start from the middle again.   We can just confirm that the `c`\\'s match up.\\n\\nNow if we expanded one more character, we would see that `b` does NOT equal `f`.  Not only does this mean that this substring is not a palindrome, it also means that all other longer palindromes centered on `e` won\\'t be palindromes either, so we don\\'t need to test the other substrings and we can just exit early.\\n\\nSo now the question is, how many different centers can a string have?  If the length of the substring is odd, then the center could be any of the characters.  If the length of the substring is even, then the center could lie <i>between</i> any two characters.  So in total, there are 2n - 1 centers (please see the video for a visualization of this).\\n\\nSo if visiting each center is O(n) and each palindrome check is O(n), then the algorithm now runs in O(n<sup>2</sup>) time.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def longestPalindrome(self, s):\\n        def expand(l, r):\\n            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:\\n                l -= 1\\n                r += 1\\n            return s[l+1:r]\\n\\n        result = \"\"\\n        for i in range(len(s)):\\n            sub1 = expand(i, i)\\n            if len(sub1) > len(result):\\n                result = sub1\\n            sub2 = expand(i, i+1)\\n            if len(sub2) > len(result):\\n                result = sub2\\n        return result\\n```",

The expandAroundCenter function is defined within the main function. This helper function takes two parameters, left and right, which represent the potential center indices of the palindrome being expanded. It tries to expand the palindrome by moving left to the left and right to the right while the characters at these indices are the same.\\n\\n1. The main function initializes an empty string longest to keep track of the longest palindromic substring found so far.\\n\\n1. It iterates through the characters of the input string s using a for loop. For each character at index i, it considers two possible cases for the center of the palindrome:\\n\\n1. Odd-length palindrome: The center is the character at index i.\\nEven-length palindrome: The center is between the characters at indices i and i + 1.\\n1. For each center, the expandAroundCenter function is called to find the longest palindromic substring that can be formed by expanding from that center.\\n\\n1. The lengths of the obtained palindromic substrings (palindrome1 and palindrome2) are compared with the length of the current longest palindromic substring. If the length of a newly found palindrome is greater, the longest is updated with that palindrome.\\n\\nFinally, the function returns the longest palindromic substring.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe main loop runs for each character in the string, and for each character, the expandAroundCenter function takes linear time to expand the palindrome. Hence, the total time complexity is O(N^2), where N is the length of the input string.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThe space complexity is O(1) as no additional data structures are used that grow with the input size.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def longestPalindrome(self, s):\\n        def expandAroundCenter(left, right):\\n            while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\\n                left -= 1\\n                right += 1\\n            return s[left + 1:right]\\n\\n        longest = \"\"\\n        for i in range(len(s)):\\n            # Odd length palindrome\\n            palindrome1 = expandAroundCenter(i, i)\\n            # Even length palindrome\\n            palindrome2 = expandAroundCenter(i, i + 1)\\n\\n            if len(palindrome1) > len(longest):\\n                longest = palindrome1\\n            if len(palindrome2) > len(longest):\\n                longest = palindrome2\\n\\n        return longest\\n```",

                "content": "# Intuition\\nIt took me a while to understand the solutions that other people were offering and the reason was simple, it\\'s because they all have terrible coding practices. Code should be easily read regardless of the space and time efficiency. \\n\\nSo this wasn\\'t necessarily my intuition and I tweaked what I saw in a way that I could and hopefully you understand. The idea is to expand outwards from any given index and determine if those sets of indices create a palindrome.\\n\\n\\n# Approach\\nThe explanation for this is pretty simple. We start at index = 0 and iterate through all values until n. At each index we call the function expandOutwards that will check the values to the left and right of the provided indices. It will continue to do so until the longest palindrome within the given range is found. \\n\\nIf you\\'re wondering why we call expandOutwards twice, look at the difference in values passed. A palindrome can have an even or odd set of values, so if we only account for scenarios where only one occurs, we will only get half the answer. \\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nThe worst case time complexity is O(n^2). As we may need to check all values in a string everytime. You could probably visual this with an input like \"aaaaaaaaa\", where all values are always equal, so it checks everything. Notice that our program needs to check a string n^2 that can be easily confirmed as a palindrome, possible room for improvement. \\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nThis one can be tricky, but our space complexity is O(n) worst case. Pay close attention to the variable temp, i and k. They are all allocated within a local space that iterates for at most n times. Because each iteration needs a new area in memory, the space each requires directly correlates to the size of the input. In reality the space complexity is closer to 5n, but we remove the constant and just say n. \\n\\n# Notes: \\nIf you have any questions or ways to improve this code, please discuss it below. Hopefully this helps someone. Best regards.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:\\n        \\n        n = len(s) # Length of the input\\n\\n        if n == 1:\\n            return s\\n\\n        def expandOutwards(start, end):\\n\\n            i = start\\n            k = end\\n\\n            if s[i] != s[k]:\\n                return \"\"\\n\\n            while(i-1 >= 0 and k+1 < n and s[i-1] == s[k+1]): \\n                i-=1\\n                k+=1\\n\\n            return s[i:k+1]\\n\\n        pal1 = \"\"\\n        pal2 = \"\"\\n        longPal = \"\"\\n\\n        for i in range(0, n-1):\\n\\n            pal1 = expandOutwards(i, i)\\n            pal2 = expandOutwards(i, i+1)\\n\\n            # Conditional assignment statement\\n            temp = pal1 if len(pal1) > len(pal2) else pal2\\n\\n            if len(temp) > len(longPal):\\n                longPal = temp\\n        \\n        return longPal\\n\\n                \\n            \\n```",

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

Find the longest common substring between S and S\\u2019, which must also be the longest palindromic substring.\\nThis seemed to work, let\\u2019s see some examples below.\\n\\nFor example,\\nS = \\u201ccaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabac\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201caba\\u201d, which is the answer.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s try another example:\\nS = \\u201cabacdfgdcaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabacdgfdcaba\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201cabacd\\u201d. Clearly, this is not a valid palindrome.\\n\\n**We could see that the longest common substring method fails when there exists a reversed copy of a non-palindromic substring in some other part of S. To rectify this, each time we find a longest common substring candidate, we check if the substring\\u2019s indices are the same as the reversed substring\\u2019s original indices. If it is, then we attempt to update the longest palindrome found so far; if not, we skip this and find the next candidate.**\\n\\nIs this part correct? \\n\\nexample string: abcxycba\\nreverse string:  abcxycba\\n\\nThe substring indices are same as reversed string original indices and yet it is not a palindrome?"

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

Find the longest common substring between S and S\\u2019, which must also be the longest palindromic substring.\\nThis seemed to work, let\\u2019s see some examples below.\\n\\nFor example,\\nS = \\u201ccaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabac\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201caba\\u201d, which is the answer.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s try another example:\\nS = \\u201cabacdfgdcaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabacdgfdcaba\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201cabacd\\u201d. Clearly, this is not a valid palindrome.\\n\\n**We could see that the longest common substring method fails when there exists a reversed copy of a non-palindromic substring in some other part of S. To rectify this, each time we find a longest common substring candidate, we check if the substring\\u2019s indices are the same as the reversed substring\\u2019s original indices. If it is, then we attempt to update the longest palindrome found so far; if not, we skip this and find the next candidate.**\\n\\nIs this part correct? \\n\\nexample string: abcxycba\\nreverse string:  abcxycba\\n\\nThe substring indices are same as reversed string original indices and yet it is not a palindrome?"

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

Find the longest common substring between S and S\\u2019, which must also be the longest palindromic substring.\\nThis seemed to work, let\\u2019s see some examples below.\\n\\nFor example,\\nS = \\u201ccaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabac\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201caba\\u201d, which is the answer.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s try another example:\\nS = \\u201cabacdfgdcaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabacdgfdcaba\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201cabacd\\u201d. Clearly, this is not a valid palindrome.\\n\\n**We could see that the longest common substring method fails when there exists a reversed copy of a non-palindromic substring in some other part of S. To rectify this, each time we find a longest common substring candidate, we check if the substring\\u2019s indices are the same as the reversed substring\\u2019s original indices. If it is, then we attempt to update the longest palindrome found so far; if not, we skip this and find the next candidate.**\\n\\nIs this part correct? \\n\\nexample string: abcxycba\\nreverse string:  abcxycba\\n\\nThe substring indices are same as reversed string original indices and yet it is not a palindrome?"

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

Find the longest common substring between S and S\\u2019, which must also be the longest palindromic substring.\\nThis seemed to work, let\\u2019s see some examples below.\\n\\nFor example,\\nS = \\u201ccaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabac\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201caba\\u201d, which is the answer.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s try another example:\\nS = \\u201cabacdfgdcaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabacdgfdcaba\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201cabacd\\u201d. Clearly, this is not a valid palindrome.\\n\\n**We could see that the longest common substring method fails when there exists a reversed copy of a non-palindromic substring in some other part of S. To rectify this, each time we find a longest common substring candidate, we check if the substring\\u2019s indices are the same as the reversed substring\\u2019s original indices. If it is, then we attempt to update the longest palindrome found so far; if not, we skip this and find the next candidate.**\\n\\nIs this part correct? \\n\\nexample string: abcxycba\\nreverse string:  abcxycba\\n\\nThe substring indices are same as reversed string original indices and yet it is not a palindrome?"

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously.

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

Find the longest common substring between S and S\\u2019, which must also be the longest palindromic substring.\\nThis seemed to work, let\\u2019s see some examples below.\\n\\nFor example,\\nS = \\u201ccaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabac\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201caba\\u201d, which is the answer.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s try another example:\\nS = \\u201cabacdfgdcaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabacdgfdcaba\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201cabacd\\u201d. Clearly, this is not a valid palindrome.\\n\\n**We could see that the longest common substring method fails when there exists a reversed copy of a non-palindromic substring in some other part of S. To rectify this, each time we find a longest common substring candidate, we check if the substring\\u2019s indices are the same as the reversed substring\\u2019s original indices. If it is, then we attempt to update the longest palindrome found so far; if not, we skip this and find the next candidate.**\\n\\nIs this part correct? \\n\\nexample string: abcxycba\\nreverse string:  abcxycba\\n\\nThe substring indices are same as reversed string original indices and yet it is not a palindrome?"

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously.

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

Find the longest common substring between S and S\\u2019, which must also be the longest palindromic substring.\\nThis seemed to work, let\\u2019s see some examples below.\\n\\nFor example,\\nS = \\u201ccaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabac\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201caba\\u201d, which is the answer.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s try another example:\\nS = \\u201cabacdfgdcaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabacdgfdcaba\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201cabacd\\u201d. Clearly, this is not a valid palindrome.\\n\\n**We could see that the longest common substring method fails when there exists a reversed copy of a non-palindromic substring in some other part of S. To rectify this, each time we find a longest common substring candidate, we check if the substring\\u2019s indices are the same as the reversed substring\\u2019s original indices. If it is, then we attempt to update the longest palindrome found so far; if not, we skip this and find the next candidate.**\\n\\nIs this part correct? \\n\\nexample string: abcxycba\\nreverse string:  abcxycba\\n\\nThe substring indices are same as reversed string original indices and yet it is not a palindrome?"

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

I cannot confirm this but I think its true because with a very unoptimized solution I got time limit exceeded very early in the test cases (for another problem), after some optimizations I got it much later (like getting to the last tests) which themselves were around the same size, so if the time limit was set per test it would not make sense to fail in a similarly long test-case just that is much later in the test list.

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

Find the longest common substring between S and S\\u2019, which must also be the longest palindromic substring.\\nThis seemed to work, let\\u2019s see some examples below.\\n\\nFor example,\\nS = \\u201ccaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabac\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201caba\\u201d, which is the answer.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s try another example:\\nS = \\u201cabacdfgdcaba\\u201d, S\\u2019 = \\u201cabacdgfdcaba\\u201d.\\nThe longest common substring between S and S\\u2019 is \\u201cabacd\\u201d. Clearly, this is not a valid palindrome.\\n\\n**We could see that the longest common substring method fails when there exists a reversed copy of a non-palindromic substring in some other part of S. To rectify this, each time we find a longest common substring candidate, we check if the substring\\u2019s indices are the same as the reversed substring\\u2019s original indices. If it is, then we attempt to update the longest palindrome found so far; if not, we skip this and find the next candidate.**\\n\\nIs this part correct? \\n\\nexample string: abcxycba\\nreverse string:  abcxycba\\n\\nThe substring indices are same as reversed string original indices and yet it is not a palindrome?"

For each of the axis, you expand at both RHS and LHS simultaneously. This method promises that when you are determining value in M[i][j], M[i + 1][j - 1] must have the correct value.\\nFinal answer can be found from all M[i][j] == 1 with largest (j - i)."

However, if you expand each possible axis at the same time, i.e. 1st iteration (s[i+1], s[j-1]), 2nd iteration `s[i+2], s[j-2]`, ... It is guaranteed that M[i+1][j-1] is always true and hence can be dropped, and you should break the loop when it is not true.\n\nIn summary, you don't need to memorise anything at all and you just need to check `s[i] == s[j]` while expanding in both directions at the same time, unless I have misunderstood anything?

That accelerated a lot.\n\nIn the almost last step, I added memoization. Remember that a palindrome is like a sandwich, with the external chars being equal and the meat being another palindrome? So I stored the found palindromes using their start and and positions. So I could check if that had already being checked and if so, either return true or false directly.\n\nThe final step was to convert the recursive function to an iterative function to save some memory used by the call stack.\nMaybe there are better implementations, just sharing my thought process."

This method compares characters from the start and end of the substring, moving toward the center.\n- In the ```longestPalindrome``` method:\n- Initialize variables ```maxLength``` to store the length of the longest palindrome found so far and start to store the starting index of the longest palindrome.\n- Iterate through all possible pairs of indexes (i, j) to consider all substrings.\n- For each substring (i, j) check if it's a palindrome using the ```isPalindrome``` method.\n- If it's a palindrome and longer than the current maximum, update ```maxLength``` and start."

However, assuming that this is a typographical error, the most likely reason why your code is exceeding the limit is because the time complexity of the algorithm is high.\\n\\nThe code is using a recursive function to check all possible substrings in the input string s, and then checking if they are palindromes or not using the check() function. This approach has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the length of the input string s.\\n\\nThis means that as the length of the input string grows, the number of recursive calls made by the algorithm also grows exponentially, leading to a potential stack overflow or timeout.\\n\\nTo optimize the algorithm, you can use dynamic programming or expand around the center approach to reduce the time complexity to O(n2).\\n\\nDynamic Programming Approach:\\n\\n- Define a boolean table of size n x n, where n is the length of the input string.\\n- Initialize all cells in the table to false.\\n- Set all cells (i, i) to true, since a single character is always a palindrome.\\n- For all pairs of indices i, j where i < j, set table[i][j] to true if s[i] == s[j] and table[i+1][j-1] is also true. - This means that a substring from i to j is a palindrome if its first and last characters are equal, and its - inner substring is also a palindrome.\\n- Keep track of the longest palindrome found so far and its starting and ending indices."

This approach has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the length of the input string s.\\n\\nThis means that as the length of the input string grows, the number of recursive calls made by the algorithm also grows exponentially, leading to a potential stack overflow or timeout.\\n\\nTo optimize the algorithm, you can use dynamic programming or expand around the center approach to reduce the time complexity to O(n2).\\n\\nDynamic Programming Approach:\\n\\n- Define a boolean table of size n x n, where n is the length of the input string.\\n- Initialize all cells in the table to false.\\n- Set all cells (i, i) to true, since a single character is always a palindrome.\\n- For all pairs of indices i, j where i < j, set table[i][j] to true if s[i] == s[j] and table[i+1][j-1] is also true. - This means that a substring from i to j is a palindrome if its first and last characters are equal, and its - inner substring is also a palindrome.\\n- Keep track of the longest palindrome found so far and its starting and ending indices."

However, assuming that this is a typographical error, the most likely reason why your code is exceeding the limit is because the time complexity of the algorithm is high.\\n\\nThe code is using a recursive function to check all possible substrings in the input string s, and then checking if they are palindromes or not using the check() function. This approach has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the length of the input string s.\\n\\nThis means that as the length of the input string grows, the number of recursive calls made by the algorithm also grows exponentially, leading to a potential stack overflow or timeout.\\n\\nTo optimize the algorithm, you can use dynamic programming or expand around the center approach to reduce the time complexity to O(n2).\\n\\nDynamic Programming Approach:\\n\\n- Define a boolean table of size n x n, where n is the length of the input string.\\n- Initialize all cells in the table to false.\\n- Set all cells (i, i) to true, since a single character is always a palindrome.\\n- For all pairs of indices i, j where i < j, set table[i][j] to true if s[i] == s[j] and table[i+1][j-1] is also true. - This means that a substring from i to j is a palindrome if its first and last characters are equal, and its - inner substring is also a palindrome.\\n- Keep track of the longest palindrome found so far and its starting and ending indices."

This approach has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the length of the input string s.\\n\\nThis means that as the length of the input string grows, the number of recursive calls made by the algorithm also grows exponentially, leading to a potential stack overflow or timeout.\\n\\nTo optimize the algorithm, you can use dynamic programming or expand around the center approach to reduce the time complexity to O(n2).\\n\\nDynamic Programming Approach:\\n\\n- Define a boolean table of size n x n, where n is the length of the input string.\\n- Initialize all cells in the table to false.\\n- Set all cells (i, i) to true, since a single character is always a palindrome.\\n- For all pairs of indices i, j where i < j, set table[i][j] to true if s[i] == s[j] and table[i+1][j-1] is also true. - This means that a substring from i to j is a palindrome if its first and last characters are equal, and its - inner substring is also a palindrome.\\n- Keep track of the longest palindrome found so far and its starting and ending indices."

However, assuming that this is a typographical error, the most likely reason why your code is exceeding the limit is because the time complexity of the algorithm is high.\\n\\nThe code is using a recursive function to check all possible substrings in the input string s, and then checking if they are palindromes or not using the check() function. This approach has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the length of the input string s.\\n\\nThis means that as the length of the input string grows, the number of recursive calls made by the algorithm also grows exponentially, leading to a potential stack overflow or timeout.\\n\\nTo optimize the algorithm, you can use dynamic programming or expand around the center approach to reduce the time complexity to O(n2).\\n\\nDynamic Programming Approach:\\n\\n- Define a boolean table of size n x n, where n is the length of the input string.\\n- Initialize all cells in the table to false.\\n- Set all cells (i, i) to true, since a single character is always a palindrome.\\n- For all pairs of indices i, j where i < j, set table[i][j] to true if s[i] == s[j] and table[i+1][j-1] is also true. - This means that a substring from i to j is a palindrome if its first and last characters are equal, and its - inner substring is also a palindrome.\\n- Keep track of the longest palindrome found so far and its starting and ending indices."

This approach has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the length of the input string s.\\n\\nThis means that as the length of the input string grows, the number of recursive calls made by the algorithm also grows exponentially, leading to a potential stack overflow or timeout.\\n\\nTo optimize the algorithm, you can use dynamic programming or expand around the center approach to reduce the time complexity to O(n2).\\n\\nDynamic Programming Approach:\\n\\n- Define a boolean table of size n x n, where n is the length of the input string.\\n- Initialize all cells in the table to false.\\n- Set all cells (i, i) to true, since a single character is always a palindrome.\\n- For all pairs of indices i, j where i < j, set table[i][j] to true if s[i] == s[j] and table[i+1][j-1] is also true. - This means that a substring from i to j is a palindrome if its first and last characters are equal, and its - inner substring is also a palindrome.\\n- Keep track of the longest palindrome found so far and its starting and ending indices."

However, assuming that this is a typographical error, the most likely reason why your code is exceeding the limit is because the time complexity of the algorithm is high.\\n\\nThe code is using a recursive function to check all possible substrings in the input string s, and then checking if they are palindromes or not using the check() function. This approach has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the length of the input string s.\\n\\nThis means that as the length of the input string grows, the number of recursive calls made by the algorithm also grows exponentially, leading to a potential stack overflow or timeout.\\n\\nTo optimize the algorithm, you can use dynamic programming or expand around the center approach to reduce the time complexity to O(n2).\\n\\nDynamic Programming Approach:\\n\\n- Define a boolean table of size n x n, where n is the length of the input string.\\n- Initialize all cells in the table to false.\\n- Set all cells (i, i) to true, since a single character is always a palindrome.\\n- For all pairs of indices i, j where i < j, set table[i][j] to true if s[i] == s[j] and table[i+1][j-1] is also true. - This means that a substring from i to j is a palindrome if its first and last characters are equal, and its - inner substring is also a palindrome.\\n- Keep track of the longest palindrome found so far and its starting and ending indices."

This is done by creating a new string \"temp\" and iterating through each character in the input string, adding it to \"temp\" and also adding the special character \"#\" after it. This modified string is then stored in \"s\".\\n\\nNext, the code defines two arrays \"p\" and \"id\" of size n+1, where n is the length of the modified string. The array \"p\" is used to hold the length of the palindrome centered at each character in the modified string and the array \"id\" is used to keep track of the center and right boundary of the current palindrome.\\n\\nThe code then initializes two variables \"mx\" and \"id\" to 0 and assigns the value 0 to all elements of the \"p\" array.\\n\\nThe algorithm then starts iterating through each character in the modified string using a for loop, for each i in s.\\n\\nThe first thing the code does inside the for loop is to check if the current character is within the right boundary of the previous palindrome. If so, it uses the \"mirroring\" technique to calculate the length of the palindrome centered at the current character. It sets the value of \"p[i]\" to the minimum of \"p[(id*2-i)\" and \"mx-i\".\\n\\nOtherwise, the code falls back to the \"expanding around the center\" technique and starts checking the characters on both sides of the current character to find the length of the palindrome centered at the current character.\\n\\nThe code then updates the \"mx\" and \"id\" variables if the current palindrome exceeds the right boundary of the previous palindrome.\\n\\nFinally, the code finds the center and length of the longest palindrome by iterating through the \"p\" array and returning the substring of the original input string using the center and length information.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that the above code is just an example and this specific implementation may be different from other ones, but the overall idea and algorithm remains the same."

This is done by creating a new string \"temp\" and iterating through each character in the input string, adding it to \"temp\" and also adding the special character \"#\" after it.

The array \"p\" is used to hold the length of the palindrome centered at each character in the modified string and the array \"id\" is used to keep track of the center and right boundary of the current palindrome.\\n\\nThe code then initializes two variables \"mx\" and \"id\" to 0 and assigns the value 0 to all elements of the \"p\" array.\\n\\nThe algorithm then starts iterating through each character in the modified string using a for loop, for each i in s.\\n\\nThe first thing the code does inside the for loop is to check if the current character is within the right boundary of the previous palindrome.

This is done by creating a new string \"temp\" and iterating through each character in the input string, adding it to \"temp\" and also adding the special character \"#\" after it. This modified string is then stored in \"s\".\\n\\nNext, the code defines two arrays \"p\" and \"id\" of size n+1, where n is the length of the modified string. The array \"p\" is used to hold the length of the palindrome centered at each character in the modified string and the array \"id\" is used to keep track of the center and right boundary of the current palindrome.\\n\\nThe code then initializes two variables \"mx\" and \"id\" to 0 and assigns the value 0 to all elements of the \"p\" array.\\n\\nThe algorithm then starts iterating through each character in the modified string using a for loop, for each i in s.\\n\\nThe first thing the code does inside the for loop is to check if the current character is within the right boundary of the previous palindrome. If so, it uses the \"mirroring\" technique to calculate the length of the palindrome centered at the current character. It sets the value of \"p[i]\" to the minimum of \"p[(id*2-i)\" and \"mx-i\".\\n\\nOtherwise, the code falls back to the \"expanding around the center\" technique and starts checking the characters on both sides of the current character to find the length of the palindrome centered at the current character.\\n\\nThe code then updates the \"mx\" and \"id\" variables if the current palindrome exceeds the right boundary of the previous palindrome.\\n\\nFinally, the code finds the center and length of the longest palindrome by iterating through the \"p\" array and returning the substring of the original input string using the center and length information.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that the above code is just an example and this specific implementation may be different from other ones, but the overall idea and algorithm remains the same."

This is done by creating a new string \"temp\" and iterating through each character in the input string, adding it to \"temp\" and also adding the special character \"#\" after it. This modified string is then stored in \"s\".\\n\\nNext, the code defines two arrays \"p\" and \"id\" of size n+1, where n is the length of the modified string. The array \"p\" is used to hold the length of the palindrome centered at each character in the modified string and the array \"id\" is used to keep track of the center and right boundary of the current palindrome.\\n\\nThe code then initializes two variables \"mx\" and \"id\" to 0 and assigns the value 0 to all elements of the \"p\" array.\\n\\nThe algorithm then starts iterating through each character in the modified string using a for loop, for each i in s.\\n\\nThe first thing the code does inside the for loop is to check if the current character is within the right boundary of the previous palindrome. If so, it uses the \"mirroring\" technique to calculate the length of the palindrome centered at the current character. It sets the value of \"p[i]\" to the minimum of \"p[(id*2-i)\" and \"mx-i\".\\n\\nOtherwise, the code falls back to the \"expanding around the center\" technique and starts checking the characters on both sides of the current character to find the length of the palindrome centered at the current character.\\n\\nThe code then updates the \"mx\" and \"id\" variables if the current palindrome exceeds the right boundary of the previous palindrome.\\n\\nFinally, the code finds the center and length of the longest palindrome by iterating through the \"p\" array and returning the substring of the original input string using the center and length information.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that the above code is just an example and this specific implementation may be different from other ones, but the overall idea and algorithm remains the same."

This is done by creating a new string \"temp\" and iterating through each character in the input string, adding it to \"temp\" and also adding the special character \"#\" after it. This modified string is then stored in \"s\".\\n\\nNext, the code defines two arrays \"p\" and \"id\" of size n+1, where n is the length of the modified string. The array \"p\" is used to hold the length of the palindrome centered at each character in the modified string and the array \"id\" is used to keep track of the center and right boundary of the current palindrome.\\n\\nThe code then initializes two variables \"mx\" and \"id\" to 0 and assigns the value 0 to all elements of the \"p\" array.\\n\\nThe algorithm then starts iterating through each character in the modified string using a for loop, for each i in s.\\n\\nThe first thing the code does inside the for loop is to check if the current character is within the right boundary of the previous palindrome. If so, it uses the \"mirroring\" technique to calculate the length of the palindrome centered at the current character. It sets the value of \"p[i]\" to the minimum of \"p[(id*2-i)\" and \"mx-i\".\\n\\nOtherwise, the code falls back to the \"expanding around the center\" technique and starts checking the characters on both sides of the current character to find the length of the palindrome centered at the current character.\\n\\nThe code then updates the \"mx\" and \"id\" variables if the current palindrome exceeds the right boundary of the previous palindrome.\\n\\nFinally, the code finds the center and length of the longest palindrome by iterating through the \"p\" array and returning the substring of the original input string using the center and length information.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that the above code is just an example and this specific implementation may be different from other ones, but the overall idea and algorithm remains the same."

                        "content": "The C++ code provided implements Manacher\\'s algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring in a given input string.\\n\\nThe code starts by defining a function named \"longestPalindrome\" which takes a string as its input and returns a string as its output.\\n\\nThe first step in the function is to preprocess the input string by inserting special characters between each character and also at the beginning and end of the string. This is done by creating a new string \"temp\" and iterating through each character in the input string, adding it to \"temp\" and also adding the special character \"#\" after it. This modified string is then stored in \"s\".\\n\\nNext, the code defines two arrays \"p\" and \"id\" of size n+1, where n is the length of the modified string. The array \"p\" is used to hold the length of the palindrome centered at each character in the modified string and the array \"id\" is used to keep track of the center and right boundary of the current palindrome.\\n\\nThe code then initializes two variables \"mx\" and \"id\" to 0 and assigns the value 0 to all elements of the \"p\" array.\\n\\nThe algorithm then starts iterating through each character in the modified string using a for loop, for each i in s.\\n\\nThe first thing the code does inside the for loop is to check if the current character is within the right boundary of the previous palindrome. If so, it uses the \"mirroring\" technique to calculate the length of the palindrome centered at the current character. It sets the value of \"p[i]\" to the minimum of \"p[(id*2-i)\" and \"mx-i\".\\n\\nOtherwise, the code falls back to the \"expanding around the center\" technique and starts checking the characters on both sides of the current character to find the length of the palindrome centered at the current character.\\n\\nThe code then updates the \"mx\" and \"id\" variables if the current palindrome exceeds the right boundary of the previous palindrome.\\n\\nFinally, the code finds the center and length of the longest palindrome by iterating through the \"p\" array and returning the substring of the original input string using the center and length information.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that the above code is just an example and this specific implementation may be different from other ones, but the overall idea and algorithm remains the same."
