It groups the records by player_id and orders the result set by player_id.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n1. It retrieves the player_id and minimum event_date for each player from the \"Activity\" table.\\n2. The group by clause groups the records based on the player_id, ensuring that each player appears only once in the result set.\\n3. The min aggregate function is applied to the event_date column within each group, selecting the minimum date as the first login date.\\n4. The result set is then ordered by player_id.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe time complexity of this query depends on the size of the \"Activity\" table and the efficiency of indexing on the player_id and event_date columns. The query involves scanning the entire table and performing a group-by operation, which can have a time complexity of O(N log N), where N is the number of rows in the table. The ordering of the result set also contributes to the time complexity, but it is typically a smaller factor compared to the group-by operation.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nThe space complexity of this query is determined by the memory required to process the grouping and sorting operations and store the result set. The space complexity is proportional to the size of the result set, which can be as large as the number of distinct player_id values in the \"Activity\" table. If the result set is relatively large, it may require additional memory resources to store and return the data. However, if the result set is small compared to the total table size, the impact on space complexity is minimal.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n# Write your MySQL query statement below\\nselect player_id, min(event_date) as first_login from Activity\\ngroup by player_id order by player_id\\n```",
