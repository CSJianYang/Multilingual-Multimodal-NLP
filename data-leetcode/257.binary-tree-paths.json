                "content": "I am not sure, why this problem is marked as hard, because we do not use any smart ideas to solve it: just do what is asked: traverse our intervals and merge them. Let us consider the case: `intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]` and go through our code:\\n\\n1. Interval `[1,2]` is before `[4,8]`, that is `y < I[0]`, so we just add it to our `res`.\\n2. Interval `[3,5]` is not before `[4,8]` but not after also, so it is the third case and we need to update `I`: `I = [3,8]` now.\\n3. Interval `[6,7]`: the same logic, update `I = [3,8]` now (it did not change though)\\n4. Interval `[8,10]`: still condition number `3`, so `I = [3,10]` now.\\n5. Interval `[12,16]`: it is after our `I`, so this is condition number `2` and we `break` from our loop: `i = 3` now.\\n6. Outside loop we combine `res = [1,2]`, `I = [3,10]` and `intervals[4:] = [12,16]`.\\n\\nWhy we use `i -= 1` inside our loop, before `break`? It can happen, that we did not visit this part and it means, that our suffix `intervals[i+1:]` should be empty.\\n\\n**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, space complexity is `O(n)` as well and additional space complexity (if we do not count our output) is `O(1)`.\\n\\n**Note**: that intstead of traversing our intervals with linear search, we can use binary search, however it will not reduce the overall complexity of algorithm, our result will have in average `O(n)` elements.\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def insert(self, intervals, I):\\n        res, i = [], -1\\n        for i, (x, y) in enumerate(intervals):\\n            if y < I[0]:\\n                res.append([x, y])\\n            elif I[1] < x:\\n                i -= 1\\n                break\\n            else:\\n                I[0] = min(I[0], x)\\n                I[1] = max(I[1], y)\\n                \\n        return res + [I] + intervals[i+1:]\\n```\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.

                "content": "# Approach and Explanation\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n1. This code defines a class Solution that contains a method insert which takes in two parameters: an array of intervals represented by a 2D array, and a new interval represented by a 1D array. The method returns a new 2D array containing the merged intervals.\\n\\n2. The approach of this code is to add the intervals that come before the new interval to the answer arraylist, then check if the new interval should be merged with the last interval in the answer arraylist, and finally, add the remaining intervals from the input array to the answer arraylist.\\n\\n3. The code first initializes an empty ArrayList called ans. The variable idx is initialized to 0, and the while loop iterates through the input intervals array. The loop compares the starting value of the current interval with the starting value of the new interval, and if the current interval\\'s starting value is less than the new interval\\'s starting value, it is added to the ans arraylist. If the starting value of the current interval is greater than or equal to the new interval\\'s starting value, the loop breaks. This ensures that the intervals in the ans arraylist will be in the same order as they were in the input array, but with the new interval inserted in the correct position.\\n\\n4. Next, the code checks if the ans arraylist is empty or if the new interval\\'s starting value is greater than the last interval\\'s ending value in the ans arraylist. If either of these conditions is true, the new interval is added to the ans arraylist. Otherwise, the last interval in the ans arraylist is merged with the new interval by updating the last interval\\'s ending value to be the maximum of the last interval\\'s ending value and the new interval\\'s ending value.\\n\\n5. Finally, the while loop iterates through the remaining intervals in the input array. The loop compares the ending value of the last interval in the ans arraylist with the starting value of the current interval. If the last interval\\'s ending value is greater than or equal to the current interval\\'s starting value, it means the two intervals overlap and should be merged. The last interval\\'s ending value is updated to be the maximum of the last interval\\'s ending value and the current interval\\'s ending value. If the last interval\\'s ending value is less than the current interval\\'s starting value, it means the two intervals do not overlap and the current interval is added to the ans arraylist.\\n\\n6. After the while loop, the ans arraylist is converted to a 2D array and returned as the final output.\\n```\\n//TC = O(n)\\n//Sc = O(n)\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int[][] insert(int[][] intervals, int[] newInterval) {   \\n       // Initialize an ArrayList to hold the merged intervals\\n        ArrayList<int[]> ans = new ArrayList<>();\\n        // Initialize a variable to track our position in the input intervals array\\n        int idx = 0;\\n        // Loop through the input intervals\\n        while(idx < intervals.length){\\n            // If the current interval starts before the new interval, add it to the answer list\\n            if(intervals[idx][0] < newInterval[0]){\\n                ans.add(intervals[idx]);\\n                idx++;\\n            // If the current interval starts after or at the same time as the new interval, exit the loop\\n            }else{\\n                break;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        // If the answer list is empty or the last interval in the answer list ends before the new interval starts\\n        // add the new interval to the answer list\\n        if(ans.size() == 0 || (newInterval[0] > ans.get(ans.size()-1)[1])){\\n            ans.add(newInterval);\\n        // If the last interval in the answer list overlaps with the new interval, merge them by updating the end time of the last interval\\n        }else{\\n            int[] lastInterval = ans.get(ans.size()-1);\\n            lastInterval[1] = Math.max(lastInterval[1],newInterval[1]);\\n        }\\n        // Loop through the remaining intervals in the input array\\n        while(idx < intervals.length){\\n            int[] lastInterval = ans.get(ans.size()-1);\\n            // If the last interval in the answer list overlaps with the current interval, merge them by updating the end time of the last interval\\n            if(lastInterval[1] >= intervals[idx][0]){\\n                lastInterval[1] = Math.max(lastInterval[1], intervals[idx][1]);\\n            }else{\\n                // If the last interval does not overlap with the current interval, add it to the answer list\\n                ans.add(intervals[idx]);\\n            }\\n            idx++;\\n        }\\n        // Convert the ArrayList to a 2D int array and return it\\n        return ans.toArray(new int[ans.size()][]);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```",

                "content": "I know this is a little messy. For clean and simple code, please use the O(n) approach. We have great answer here with just 3 while loops. The BS approach utilizes the ordered characteristic of the input. For me, I want to get the position of the interval that is the first to have start equal to or larger than the inserted interval's start. Similarly, I get the position of the interval that is the first to have end equal to or larger than the new interval's end. Then I can get the range of intervals that the new interval connects. There are some corner cases that need to be considered, i.e. when the new interval has no overlap with any of the existing intervals (smaller, larger, or the original list is empty).

The BS approach utilizes the ordered characteristic of the input. For me, I want to get the position of the interval that is the first to have start equal to or larger than the inserted interval's start. Similarly, I get the position of the interval that is the first to have end equal to or larger than the new interval's end. Then I can get the range of intervals that the new interval connects. There are some corner cases that need to be considered, i.e. when the new interval has no overlap with any of the existing intervals (smaller, larger, or the original list is empty).

Then it will `merge` any overlapping intervals with the new interval and update its `start` and `end` times. `Finally`, it will insert the new interval into the correct position in the intervals and `return` the modified intervals.\\n* The `key` idea behind this approach is to maintain the `sorted` order of the intervals, and to `merge` any overlapping intervals with the new interval. \\n* By iterating through the intervals and keeping track of the index where the new interval should be `inserted`, we can ensure that the intervals `remain` sorted, and by merging any `overlapping` intervals with the new interval, we can ensure that the final `output` has no `overlapping` intervals.\\n\\n**C++:**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<vector<int>> insert(vector<vector<int>>& intervals, vector<int>& newInterval) {\\n        vector<vector<int>> res;\\n        int i = 0, n = intervals.size();\\n        while (i < n && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]) res.push_back(intervals[i++]);\\n        while (i < n && intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]) newInterval = {min(intervals[i][0], newInterval[0]), max(intervals[i][1], newInterval[1])}, i++;\\n        res.push_back(newInterval);\\n        while (i < n) res.push_back(intervals[i++]);\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n**Java:**\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int[][] insert(int[][] intervals, int[] newInterval) {\\n        List<int[]> res = new ArrayList<>();\\n        int i = 0, n = intervals.length;\\n        while (i < n && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]) res.add(intervals[i++]);\\n        while (i < n && intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]) newInterval = new int[] {Math.min(intervals[i][0], newInterval[0]), Math.max(intervals[i][1], newInterval[1])}, i++;\\n        res.add(newInterval);\\n        while (i < n) res.add(intervals[i++]);\\n        return res.toArray(new int[res.size()][2]);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n**Python:**\\n\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\\n        res = []\\n        i = 0\\n        n = len(intervals)\\n        while i < n and intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]:\\n            res.append(intervals[i])\\n            i += 1\\n        while i < n and intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]:\\n            newInterval[0] = min(intervals[i][0], newInterval[0])\\n            newInterval[1] = max(intervals[i][1], newInterval[1])\\n            i += 1\\n        res.append(newInterval)\\n        while i < n:\\n            res.append(intervals[i])\\n            i += 1\\n        return res\\n```\\n\\n----\\nThe **Time complexity** is **O(n)** \\nThe **Space complexity** is **O(n)** .\\n\\n----\\n\\n\\n",

                "content": "By far the best solution I have seen is of `O(n)` time (some solutions claim to be of `O(logn)` turns out to be `O(n)`). One of the simplest ideas is to compare each interval in `intervals` (`intervals[i]`) with `newInterval` and then perform respective operations according to their relationships.\\n\\n 1. If they overlap, merge them to `newInterval`;\\n 2. If `intervals[i]` is to the left of `newInterval`, push `intervals[i]` to the result vector;\\n 3. If `newInterval` is to the left of `intervals[i]`, push `newInterval` and all the remaining intervals (`intervals[i]`, ..., `intervals[n - 1]`) to the result vector.\\n\\nThe code is as follows. \\n\\n    class Solution {\\n    public:\\n        vector<Interval> insert(vector<Interval>& intervals, Interval newInterval) {\\n            vector<Interval> res;\\n            int n = intervals.size();\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                if (intervals[i].end < newInterval.start)\\n                    res.push_back(intervals[i]);\\n                else if (newInterval.end < intervals[i].start) {\\n                    res.push_back(newInterval);\\n                    for (int j = i; j < n; j++)\\n                        res.push_back(intervals[j]);\\n                    return res; \\n                }\\n                else newInterval = merge(intervals[i], newInterval);\\n            }\\n            res.push_back(newInterval);\\n            return res;\\n        }\\n    private:\\n        Interval merge(Interval& interval1, Interval& interval2) {\\n            int start = min(interval1.start, interval2.start);\\n            int end = max(interval1.end, interval2.end);\\n            return Interval(start, end);\\n        }\\n    };\\n\\nAnother idea is to search for the two ends of the overlapping intervals using binary search. Then we only need to merge `newInterval` with the intervals at the two ends if they overlap. All the intervals within the two ends will be contained in` newInterval`.\\n\\nLet's do the example in the problem statement: `intervals = [1, 2], [3, 5], [6, 7], [8, 10], [12, 16]` and `newInterval = [4, 9]`. We first find the rightmost interval with `start` smaller than that of `newInterval`, which is `[3, 5]`. Then we find the leftmost interval with `end` larger than that of `newInterval`, which is `[8, 10]`. Then all the intervals between them will be contained within `newInterval` (you may check this to convince yourself) and so can be safely ignored. We only need to check whether `newInterval` overlaps with the two intervals on the two ends and merge them if necessary.\\n\\nThe complete code is as follows.\\n\\n    class Solution {\\n    public:\\n        vector<Interval> insert(vector<Interval>& intervals, Interval newInterval) {\\n            int n = intervals.size(), leftEnd, rightEnd, l, r;\\n            vector<Interval> res;\\n            // Find the rightmost interval with start smaller than that of newInterval\\n            for (l = 0, r = n - 1; l <= r; ) {\\n                int mid = l + ((r - l) >> 1);\\n                if (intervals[mid].start > newInterval.start)\\n                    r = mid - 1;\\n                else l = mid + 1;\\n            } \\n            leftEnd = r;\\n            // Find the leftmost interval with end larger than that of newInterval\\n            for (l = 0, r = n - 1; l <= r; ) {\\n                int mid = l + ((r - l) >> 1);\\n                if (intervals[mid].end < newInterval.end)\\n                    l = mid + 1;\\n                else r = mid - 1;\\n            }\\n            rightEnd = l;\\n            // Merge newInterval with intervals[leftEnd] and intervals[rightEnd] if necessary\\n            if (leftEnd >= 0 && intervals[leftEnd].end >= newInterval.start)\\n                newInterval.start = intervals[leftEnd--].start;\\n            if (rightEnd < n && intervals[rightEnd].start <= newInterval.end)\\n                newInterval.end = intervals[rightEnd++].end;\\n            // Save the intervals sequentially\\n            for (int i = 0; i <= leftEnd; i++)\\n                res.push_back(intervals[i]);\\n            res.push_back(newInterval);\\n            for (int i = rightEnd; i < n; i++)\\n                res.push_back(intervals[i]);\\n            return res;\\n        }\\n    };",

The new interval\\'s range is before the current interval, so we can insert the new interval into answer and update new interval to the current interval.\\n- If case 2 occurs,ie. The new interval is after the range of current interval, so we can simply insert the current interval into answer.\\n- If case 3 occurs,ie. The new interval overlaps with current interval, so we update the first element of new interval to the minimum of current interval and new interval and update the second element of new interval to the maximum of current interval and new interval.\\nExample interval= {5,9} and new interval= {6,11}. Then update new interval = {min(5,6),max(9,11)}={5,11}\\n- At the end of iterations simply insert new interval to the answer.\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:O(n)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector<vector<int>> insert(vector<vector<int>>& intervals, vector<int>& newInterval) {\\n        vector<vector<int>> ans;\\n        \\n        for(int i=0;i<intervals.size();i++){\\n            //case 1 occurs\\n            if(intervals[i][0] > newInterval[1]){\\n                ans.push_back(newInterval);\\n                newInterval = intervals[i]; \\n            }\\n\\n            //case 2 occurs\\n            else if(intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]){ans.push_back(intervals[i]);}       \\n    \\n            //case 3 occurs\\n            else if(intervals[i][1] >= newInterval[0] || intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]){\\n                newInterval[0] = min(intervals[i][0], newInterval[0]);\\n                newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        //final step\\n        ans.push_back(newInterval); \\n        return ans;\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n**Please upvote if it helped.

Imagine these given intervals:\\n```\\n    [     ] [ ] [  ]\\n```\\nImagine them on an x-axis line.\\n\\nWe may need to insert the following intervals:\\n```\\n    [     ] [ ] [  ]\\n |           |   \\n\\n | |\\n                         | |\\n\\n```\\n\\nThese are three situations where we may need to insert a new interval.\\n\\nThe first one overlaps multiple given intervals, the second one doesn\\'t overlap and should be inserted in the beginning, and the last is non-overlapping and should be inserted in the end.\\n\\nWe either need to *merge* the interval with one of the given intervals (or multiple), or insert it.\\n\\n*If we merge an interval, we don\\'t impact the intervals previously added*, because they are sorted. `nextIntervalEnd > previousStart`, which is always true because of non-overlapping sorted property.\\n\\nTherefore we need to merge intervals *until* we find an interval that started after the merged interval.\\n\\nIf the given interval doesn\\'t overlap with the merged interval, we simply add it to the result array.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n`O(n)`\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n`O(n)`\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int[][] insert(int[][] intervals, int[] newInterval) {\\n        List<int[]> mergedIntervals = new ArrayList<>();\\n        int[] merged = new int[] {newInterval[0], newInterval[1]};\\n        boolean isInserted = false;\\n\\n        for (int[] interval : intervals) {\\n            if(interval[0] > merged[1]) {\\n                if(!isInserted) {\\n                    mergedIntervals.add(merged);\\n                    isInserted = true;\\n                }\\n                mergedIntervals.add(interval);\\n                \\n            } else {\\n                // does intersect\\n                if(doesIntersect(merged, interval)) {\\n                    merged[0] = Math.min(merged[0], interval[0]);\\n                    merged[1] = Math.max(merged[1], interval[1]);\\n                } else {\\n                    // not intersecting\\n                    mergedIntervals.add(interval);\\n                }\\n                \\n                \\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        // new interval is at the end\\n        if(!isInserted) {\\n            mergedIntervals.add(merged);\\n            isInserted = true;\\n        }\\n\\n        // Java specific to copy to arr[][]...\\n        int[][] res = new int[mergedIntervals.size()][2];\\n        for(int i = 0; i < mergedIntervals.size(); i++) {\\n            res[i] = mergedIntervals.get(i);\\n        }\\n        return res;\\n\\n    }\\n\\n    private boolean doesIntersect(int[] intervalA, int[] intervalB) {\\n        return intervalA[0] <= intervalB[1] && intervalB[0] <= intervalA[1];\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Some are solved by dp and other by greedy. So I think i found a little trick , given a problem statement try to first sort it by different parameters given in the question like startTime , endTime or some other and then try to see if you can find answer by greedy going through the sorted array , this is because all the greedy solutions requires some sort of sorting if it is not sorted already. If you can find a intuition or solve by greedy even after sorting then the problem is most likely an dp problem. Please comment what you think about this. Please upvote."

If you can find a intuition or solve by greedy even after sorting then the problem is most likely an dp problem. Please comment what you think about this. Please upvote."

At worst, we will have h nodes in the path - where h is the height of the tree, and n is the total number of nodes in the tree. Therefore we get a time complexity of O((n/2 + 1) * h) = O(n * h).\\n\\n**Space Complexity Explanation:** This is trivial, we are using Depth-First Search, and an extra list which can contain at most h nodes - where h is the height of the tree.

We\\'ll implement a recursive helper function `solve()` that takes two parameters: the current node and the current path string. The `solve()` function will traverse the tree in a depth-first manner and append the root-to-leaf paths to the `ans` list.\\n\\nIn the `solve()` function:\\n1. Append the string representation of the current node\\'s value to the path string (`s += str(root.val)`).\\n2. Check if the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no left or right child). If so, it means we have reached the end of a root-to-leaf path. In this case, append the current path string to the `ans` list and return.\\n3. If the current node has a right child, recursively call `solve()` with the right child and the updated path string (`solve(root.right, s + \"->\")`).\\n4. If the current node has a left child, recursively call `solve()` with the left child and the updated path string (`solve(root.left, s + \"->\")`).\\n\\nAfter defining the `solve()` function, we initialize an empty `ans` list. Then, we call `solve()` with the `root` node and an empty path string (`\"\"`). Finally, we return the `ans` list, which contains all the root-to-leaf paths.\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def binaryTreePaths(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[str]:\\n        ans = []\\n        def solve(root, s):\\n            s += str(root.val)\\n            if not root.right and not root.left:\\n                ans.append(s)\\n                return\\n            if root.right:\\n                solve(root.right, s+\"->\")\\n            if root.left:\\n                solve(root.left, s+\"->\")\\n        solve(root, \"\")\\n        return ans\\n```",

Compared with the breadth-first search approach, this approach doesn't need to have a vector of vectors to keep the paths from root to the nodes at the current level. Besides the result vector of strings, this approach just needs one vector which keeps one path from root to the current node and one unordered set which keeps all the nodes that have been visited during the depth-first search. Thus, with respect the space complexity, the depth-first search is more efficient than the breadth-first search.\\n\\n    class Solution \\n    {\\n        // Generate the path string from the TreeNode val vector.\\n        string GetPathStringFromNums(vector<int> &pathVal)\\n        {\\n            int n = pathVal.size();\\n            string res;\\n            // For the nodes except the last node, we need to \\n            // append \"->\" to the node values.\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)\\n            {\\n                res += (to_string(pathVal[i]) + \"->\");\\n            }\\n            \\n            if (n > 0)\\n            {\\n                res += to_string(pathVal[n - 1]);\\n            }\\n            \\n            return res;\\n        }\\n        \\n    public:\\n        vector<string> binaryTreePaths(TreeNode* root) \\n        {\\n            vector<string> paths;\\n            // If root is NULL, return an empty path vector immediately.\\n            if (root == nullptr)\\n            {\\n                return paths;\\n            }\\n            \\n            // pathVal is a vector of TreeNode values along a path \\n            // starting from root.\\n            vector<int> pathVal({root->val});\\n            \\n            // st is the stack used for the depth-first search.\\n            stack<TreeNode*> st;\\n            st.push(root);\\n            \\n            // visitedNodes keeps all the nodes which have been visited \\n            // during the depth-first search.

                "content": "\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\n1. The `binaryTreePath` method takes three parameters: `root` (the current node in the binary tree), `path` (a string representing the path from the root to the current node), and `list` (a list to store all the paths).\\n   \\n2. The first condition checks if the `root` is null, which means we have reached the end of a path. In this case, it simply returns the `list` as it is.\\n\\n3. The second condition checks if the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it doesn\\'t have any left or right child). If it is a leaf node, it means we have reached the end of a path, so we add the current path (`path + root.val`) to the `list` and return the updated `list`.\\n\\n4. If the above conditions are not met, it means we are still traversing the tree. We recursively call the `binaryTreePath` method for the left child of the current node, passing the updated `path` (including the current node value and an arrow \"->\") and the same `list`.\\n\\n5. Similarly, we recursively call the `binaryTreePath` method for the right child of the current node, passing the updated `path` and the same `list`.\\n\\n6. Finally, after traversing all the paths, we return the `list` containing all the paths.\\n\\n7. The `binaryTreePaths` method is the public interface for this functionality. It initializes an empty list (`list`) and calls the `binaryTreePath` method with the `root` of the binary tree, an empty string as the initial path, and the `list`.\\n\\n8. It returns the `list` containing all the paths from the root to the leaf nodes in the binary tree.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\no(n)\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\no(n)\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\n/**\\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\\n * public class TreeNode {\\n *     int val;\\n *     TreeNode left;\\n *     TreeNode right;\\n *     TreeNode() {}\\n *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }\\n *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {\\n *         this.val = val;\\n *         this.left = left;\\n *         this.right = right;\\n *     }\\n * }\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\n    public List<String> binaryTreePath(TreeNode root,String path,List<String> list){\\n        if(root == null){\\n            return list;\\n        }\\n        if(root.left == null && root.right == null){\\n            list.add(path + root.val);\\n            return list;\\n        }\\n        binaryTreePath(root.left,(path + root.val + \"->\"),list);\\n        binaryTreePath(root.right,(path + root.val + \"->\"),list);\\n        return list;\\n    }\\n    public List<String> binaryTreePaths(TreeNode root) {\\n        List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();\\n        binaryTreePath(root,\"\",list);\\n        return list;\\n    }\\n}\\n```",

Declare a function `rec` that takes three parameters: a pointer to a `TreeNode` object named `root`, a reference to a vector of strings named `ans`, and a string named `temp`.\\n2. Inside the `rec` function, check if `root` is `NULL` (i.e., there is no node). If true, return from the function.\\n3. Append the string representation of `root->val` followed by \"->\" to the `temp` string.\\n4. Check if both the left and right child nodes of `root` are `NULL`. If true, it means the current node is a leaf node.\\n5. Remove the last two characters from the `temp` string to eliminate the arrow \"->\" from the leaf node\\'s path.\\n6. Add the `temp` string to the `ans` vector since it represents a complete path from the root to a leaf node.\\n7. Return from the function.\\n8. Call the `rec` function recursively for the left child of `root` and pass the `ans` and `temp` strings as arguments.\\n9. Call the `rec` function recursively for the right child of `root` and pass the `ans` and `temp` strings as arguments.\\n10. Declare a function `binaryTreePaths` that takes a pointer to a `TreeNode` object named `root` as a parameter.\\n11. Inside the `binaryTreePaths` function, check if `root` is `NULL`. If true, return an empty vector since there are no paths in an empty tree.\\n12. Declare a vector of strings named `ans` to store the paths.\\n13. Call the `rec` function, passing `root`, `ans`, and an empty string as arguments to start the recursive traversal.\\n14. Return the `ans` vector containing all the paths from the root to the leaves.\\n------------------------------\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(n) n=number of nodes.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(h) h=maximum height of tree. \\nIn worst case skewed tree height is O(n). \\n--------------------------------------\\nPlease Upvote.

Inside the `rec` function, check if `root` is `NULL` (i.e., there is no node). If true, return from the function.\\n3. Append the string representation of `root->val` followed by \"->\" to the `temp` string.\\n4. Check if both the left and right child nodes of `root` are `NULL`. If true, it means the current node is a leaf node.\\n5. Remove the last two characters from the `temp` string to eliminate the arrow \"->\" from the leaf node\\'s path.\\n6. Add the `temp` string to the `ans` vector since it represents a complete path from the root to a leaf node.\\n7. Return from the function.\\n8.

Inside the `rec` function, check if `root` is `NULL` (i.e., there is no node). If true, return from the function.\\n3. Append the string representation of `root->val` followed by \"->\" to the `temp` string.\\n4. Check if both the left and right child nodes of `root` are `NULL`. If true, it means the current node is a leaf node.\\n5. Remove the last two characters from the `temp` string to eliminate the arrow \"->\" from the leaf node\\'s path.\\n6. Add the `temp` string to the `ans` vector since it represents a complete path from the root to a leaf node.\\n7. Return from the function.\\n8.

Inside the `rec` function, check if `root` is `NULL` (i.e., there is no node). If true, return from the function.\\n3. Append the string representation of `root->val` followed by \"->\" to the `temp` string.\\n4. Check if both the left and right child nodes of `root` are `NULL`. If true, it means the current node is a leaf node.\\n5. Remove the last two characters from the `temp` string to eliminate the arrow \"->\" from the leaf node\\'s path.\\n6. Add the `temp` string to the `ans` vector since it represents a complete path from the root to a leaf node.\\n7. Return from the function.\\n8.

Call the `rec` function recursively for the left child of `root` and pass the `ans` and `temp` strings as arguments.\\n9. Call the `rec` function recursively for the right child of `root` and pass the `ans` and `temp` strings as arguments.\\n10. Declare a function `binaryTreePaths` that takes a pointer to a `TreeNode` object named `root` as a parameter.\\n11. Inside the `binaryTreePaths` function, check if `root` is `NULL`. If true, return an empty vector since there are no paths in an empty tree.\\n12. Declare a vector of strings named `ans` to store the paths.\\n13. Call the `rec` function, passing `root`, `ans`, and an empty string as arguments to start the recursive traversal.\\n14. Return the `ans` vector containing all the paths from the root to the leaves.\\n------------------------------\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\nO(n) n=number of nodes.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\nO(h) h=maximum height of tree. \\nIn worst case skewed tree height is O(n). \\n--------------------------------------\\nPlease Upvote.
